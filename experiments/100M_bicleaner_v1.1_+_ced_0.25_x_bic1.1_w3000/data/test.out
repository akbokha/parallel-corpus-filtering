28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ well of a local shopping mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse , found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ ici@@ a from San Francisco , divided the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a , informed the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who had previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job six months ago as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a stated that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distributed Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a said that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to connect his style with his family was to cook us always something to prepare for dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the flow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that lit bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the telephone number of the S@@ F@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put into drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made Hollywood star clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or glued to outside labels that have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more s@@ nu@@ g to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of television with loose dental and Mexican food , she says in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she brings the question of the desire for child@@ birth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited with some colleagues a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted back home in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and that ended the riding career again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer at all times - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses .
he left with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not catch himself for photo @-@ purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport aid handed over the man from An@@ hausen in the scope of a small gala , the Golden S@@ ort Py@@ ramid .
there is no lack of awards for the symp@@ athetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen had already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is awarded not only for sporting success but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents for decades .
and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exhibitors include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the legendary Cor@@ nel@@ ia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ us@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ rider Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the ski@@ pper Al@@ win Scho@@ cker öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand @-@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company wander@@ ed into the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and P@@ umps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presi@@ dency candidates are un@@ aware of the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep it small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claims Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will decline regul@@ ators massi@@ vely , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton on the other hand says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has opportunities to open up discrimination and needs money for it .
that is why taxes for the rich would increase , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investing in the need to invest , say Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly refused by the Republi@@ cans of the state @-@ critical Te@@ apar@@ ty wing of the Republi@@ cans .
thus , there could still be internal discussions on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to announce it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly strengthen renew@@ ables with its investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ ed trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs .
they are to be paid better , too , demands Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a wage .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : one time he says : the minimum wage must r@@ ump , then he says he cannot be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop rather to the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens , is about to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics believe that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every escaped woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing themselves .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
it has been officially opened for a long time .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors either .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not exagger@@ ating to say : every woman who arrives here has experience with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death , or because their families are sending them to Europe as hope @-@ carriers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honour kill@@ ings , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs for example ask for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believes that the end , once they come to Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the housing in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , it appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what they have experienced , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodations only for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district administr@@ ations are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
some with no answer to the question whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction .
in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there is no such thing in the accommodations of governments .
also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , escaped women are not accommod@@ ated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokesperson for the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - und Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are floors or own homes only for single women and their children in some common shel@@ ters .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is missing , men and women are accommod@@ ated , there can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible to women easily , stands in the study .
how much the women feel this need for protection can be read at the rush that it gives to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around that we have been around , we have a long queue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strikes : demands for new combat measures &quot; &quot; &quot;
agents of the assistance doctors have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new working conditions in their disputes relating to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more action in the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers would have ab@@ stained from wor@@ rying about the contract .
in July , assistance physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persi@@ sted calm@@ ly &quot; would have had problems , leading to the fact that the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Board voted in favour of completely rej@@ ecting the proposed new treaty and requ@@ esting official new negotiations to all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating working conditions which begins at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that assistant doctors struck six times this year , the first complete failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assistance doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed terms of contract recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians and medical students , that the contract should be advantageous and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be enforced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed narrow@@ ly and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly about his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as though there was never been anything bad .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was wre@@ cked .
Putin told Putin and accused Ankara of being in the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater , because it was committed by a supposed friend .
to rebuild the ve@@ to is difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks had to blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia could win a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he was removed almost from his office last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
this week the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is accompanied by persistent res@@ ent@@ ment on the s@@ nail &apos;s pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is intended to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state gained a bonus in Ankara with certainty that after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat he demanded support for the elected state organs .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which has even a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit meeting in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described to me : two countries that are driven away from the West and treated badly and are now allied .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they wouldn &apos;t even have touched the subject .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences , while Putin chose to emphas@@ ise them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of hostili@@ ties - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State are talking at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to clients outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s head of state , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to clients outside Scotland .
according to the BBC Scotland , Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be saved and saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to clients in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised head office and the stock exchange listing will change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the private customers business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of clients and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer be possible to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that these brands would have been launched .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .

Russian Putin dr@@ ens Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the tigh@@ test of trust in Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environment and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , Putin is saying that without giving reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s ordered his duties as President of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been his deputy since 2012 , was named his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated at the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was chief executive officer and staff leader of the regi@@ strar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said about his appointment to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked for leaving his post and having recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow more mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was for a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced , especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official claim - that a man who once was pri@@ zed as a potential president to run Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compla@@ ining for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
prior to that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was named his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia , as a third term of the term would viol@@ ate Putin &apos;s constitution .
but this post was taken by another , closest ally , Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president again three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination of the set of the Los Angeles series last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced his dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before announ@@ cing his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details of how the character Gib@@ son from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is written out , according to the opinion of ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios is expected at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will not be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the planned broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28 September .
puzzles for fish , which landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be about 75 fish for sandals that have been sp@@ iced out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope hoping that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected to F@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings to the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four clos@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling fans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
economic Minister Keith Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witness of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the entire bridge de@@ cks are at their place and the last section of the deck gets a d@@ ong@@ ation for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ oriented construction and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last street section and its connection with the north tower in the expansion , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the side of the country .
this was achieved by pulling the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 mil@@ lim@@ eter south .
this was a massive and at the same time very tricky activity .
massive , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
because the toler@@ ances on which the team works were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately , everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being tos@@ sed off from fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station sounded an alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set the worst off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already taken the boat out of its range , until we left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a boat without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have happiness un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this dis@@ b@@ anded when bo@@ ating the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
somebody has watched over these men today .
seriously injured - man smo@@ kes his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police informed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcoholic killed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and on the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpet@@ rator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
she then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street she met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds up @-@ priced apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Invest@@ ors are to be taken into duty much more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD recommends a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living room for action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is inevitable .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a regulation is lacking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to build on urban areas must in future pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be established in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the City Hall is , as Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development program , which will cost millions and still has to be financed , should provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants investors to make as few rules as possible .
the left wants to be even harder for investors .
despite this , as Brat@@ mann , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market is van@@ ishing .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you reconci@@ le the loss of other around 1300 advantageous apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prevent this , according to plan @-@ political spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , now ongoing bind@@ ings should be bought from the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it would have to be thought of bringing apartments back to the price binding .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
the problem could be solved at one stroke .
because in the West Town , dead@@ lines run out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social housing in the West Town is drastically increased , it is removed from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few neighbour@@ hoods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found yet .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go out to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time gaz@@ ing on screens has been depl@@ eted by many over the last decade .
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS , and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that put the &quot; average &quot; person back every day .
Cardi@@ ac , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35@@ ,000 users , told Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of following people who exercise every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks at the raw data for the increase in performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to get &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sports are reducing their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes , and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the miracle of Pok@@ em@@ on Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close friends on the hunt .
as always , there are also m@@ ump@@ y game @-@ per@@ ches , which always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone might run against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even though smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit have been able to track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us any reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will dimin@@ ish over time .
however , due to Pok@@ é@@ mon &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , fit@@ ter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ ge creates gold in the women &apos;s ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is on all this immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ ort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on whole line brilliant .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast rang out on Thursday for the competition title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt tur@@ mo@@ il on the floating beam during the single multi @-@ campaign of women in gymnas@@ tics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American who wins a battle of battle , and the fifth , while consoli@@ dating its reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment came to an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated her sport for the last three years , 15 World Champion med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as disappointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ battle array of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell ceremony of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insisted on having never planned the future during her long journey , this is not really true .
part of her floor exercises - which includes her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a training flight into the gym@@ nasi@@ um in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no competition for competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes .
even though Mu@@ staf@@ a slightly led through two turns , the image sli@@ d .
Swedish bar and ground floor - in which Bil@@ es holds the title of the world - l@@ ur@@ ks .
she resum@@ ed with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor , she still sat on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly as she expected her grand@@ child - a pure form@@ ality - and tears f@@ lowed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collecting book .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ a .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her floor exercise she threw Kus@@ sh@@ ende to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared du@@ bi@@ ous .
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly expanding we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in serial kill@@ ings when hearing music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of Phoenix &apos;s dead@@ liest attacks for a decade , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ an@@ ie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities .
the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots out of a hand @-@ gun while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder did not appear to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y attack because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokesperson for Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard stated that the shooting had led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed and two more injured in His@@ panic residential neighbor@@ hoods within four months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincoln .
investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah still died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and that it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves and secured a ball of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most of the six @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his old age , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I didn &apos;t let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and you have been informed that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize them under certain circumstances and that he might not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit nor craw@@ l up to his age of three and he can still not speak .
but he slowly progres@@ ses .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund believes in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something before &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund invented some notes alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as well as Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus during pregnancy .
symptoms and pre@@ dictions may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and it still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect them to tell me someone really .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rain@@ falls , floo@@ ding gives rise to ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the Gover@@ nor to call on the emergency booth on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River flooded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards indicated that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the congregation of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa claimed tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service promised that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
a flood warning system was deployed on Friday in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama while still ra@@ ining in the Mobile Area .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river A@@ mite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels after the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ tmann says that both rivers could flood a lot of houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
it also said that a downstream surge in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers are only slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still hoo@@ ked people out of flood water in the districts of A@@ mite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved from Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , grew greatly over night .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flo@@ ated and stre@@ amed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said to Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they stayed until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the flood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ ins and that the authorities might consider ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ tmann an observer reported close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the floor has been considerably balanced by ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and lessons in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa took 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which now both were flooded .
the Chief Apostle of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets who were r@@ ins@@ ed by the flood .
in the cities of A@@ mite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ated people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to high water and sand bags for the residents were provided , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood that we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses were reported to be in@@ und@@ ated on Thursday , but no reported on Friday .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in A@@ mite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; survi@@ ves in Philadelphia
the police informed that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time a six @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents admitted that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was conscious of his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
Brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
also shot three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in a critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it had come to a cross @-@ fire between several gun@@ men .
cartridge shells for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , over@@ came the scene of the crime .
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the pav@@ ement , there were cas@@ u@@ alties .
it seems that there have been several armed fighters who were very active there , &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia .
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ port@@ edly veri@@ fying the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a cri@@ mp on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ ad in the gymnas@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first of all , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and second : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls from other skin colors .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the ca@@ tho@@ lic is , makes everybody proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gym@@ na@@ sts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner in the last Olympic Games .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple World Championships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , who won gold at an individual competition event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but so do trainers in the whole country do not look like this .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to get it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four female gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that Tur@@ nen is an expensive sports and gym@@ n@@ astic in private gy@@ ms , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , orientation , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for coaches and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ tables lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs , which can support the business .
in these clubs the gym@@ na@@ sts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since they started with the gymnas@@ tics .
we have to offer many young girls , who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , to make a more affordable and accessible gym@@ n@@ ast .
I have founded my gymnas@@ tics foundation of 20 years .
during my events we have offered free and affordable gym@@ n@@ astic in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to take part in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance physicians would like to organize more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 Assistance physicians who voted in a vote rejected him .
in July Hun@@ t had unveiled plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients .
the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend supplements to improve the care of the day @-@ to @-@ day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistance , announced last night in a message with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed agreement , in particular that it will heat up the current financial crisis and arrange it to treat all physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by talking called on the government for reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was done by a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had only done last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the vibration and address the worries of the assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he fails to do so , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work @-@ fighting measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better weekend pay for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS staff , called on the assistance physicians to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working conditions do not achieve anything that is little , but already burden over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare patients , car@@ ers and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we talked to the Committee of the Assistant Doc@@ tors and responded positively to the concerns about gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training sessions , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender specific wage gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health on compliance with the BM@@ A agreements in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for persons with heart disease .
the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or further heart attack .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffers a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
when the flooring breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot loos@@ ens , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ logging the blood flow to the brain which causes a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the N@@ ICE draft version , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have a heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are happy that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness lets electoral fraud in Muslim areas flour@@ ish
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the insti@@ gation of a government report on corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to broad@@ ening electoral fraud in Muslim communities ignor@@ antly ignored , such as a devastating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les attacks the police , election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and local government , who is now an antagon@@ ist king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off belts outside of electoral cabinets in order to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should have an identification card to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a vot@@ er must merely name his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they leave their vote to prevent someone choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves against electoral fraud , but should also protect the local government from the broader corporate culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s electoral scandal in the east of London .
last year , a special election court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation , where one person chose to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there were evidence of fraud across the country .
he expressed himself particularly alar@@ ming for the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the fo@@ gging of evi@@ dences to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof , pressure has been applied to vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... governmental institutions had unknow@@ ingly ignored such behavior due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric talked about 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban on political activists to process letter selection papers to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ aping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also calls for tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing according to your identification .
not to use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter selection .
prohibition of political activists to process full let@@ ter@@ sel@@ ections and envel@@ opes of letter sel@@ ections .
the police have the authority to set up shut @-@ off for election stations .
a change of law that facilit@@ ated an indictment due to in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
prohibition of taking photographs in bal@@ lot stations .
requirement that only English should be used in the electoral districts ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees generally assert that voters go to the cabin alone .
Sir Eric stum@@ bles over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on a number of reasons - according to the high demands of criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ti@@ cking controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the City Hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country carries a proud legacy as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about Kate &apos;s bi@@ ker bi@@ ker and other famous Doppel@@ gänger from Olympic athletes in Rio
this week , fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have come out of the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , out of margin and volume , which proved to be the impressive double @-@ tran@@ sit@@ ter of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic champion is by far not the only athlete who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger in this summer - at least not if one is allowed to believe in the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans showing more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the Hunter and the Wolf : team member of the U.S. squ@@ ad in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger written on the racing track , many people on the internet showed how a certain bow@@ man could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ y in a similar way .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I &apos;ll take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focal point : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a with her big expressive eyes will be able to pass through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a gear higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Theatre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver med@@ alli@@ st Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova exhibits more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resemble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory in space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese float &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flew off &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and during the race like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he shared his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle Squ@@ ad@@ ron .
Mac@@ Donald , who was brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS , to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , she went like a pig , died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese float of Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the floating relay 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ mm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot has not en@@ capsul@@ ated that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China has been described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming staff@@ el for women as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , with which many were talking to him
Twitter users didn &apos;t look back when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like ra@@ cists . # disgu@@ ised .
a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC program , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary on a swimming power has been broadcast . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the year , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for over 90 times to the people who responded to the em@@ blem on Twitter
comment@@ ator &apos;s colleague , Scott Russ@@ el , had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ined about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly yesterday night to our viewers on show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I focused on the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bu@@ yer in Pri@@ mark swe@@ ars over woman who sham@@ elessly do@@ zes under@@ wear in the midst of business
the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ t to try under@@ pants .
in order to ag@@ grav@@ ate the situation , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed how she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back into the shelf again .
they continued to browse and tasted four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman pro@@ bi@@ bed the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she came back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the col@@ lage , pulled out her own trousers and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three further under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like it and went out and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone watching - or thinking about the person who under certain circumstances would buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how reluct@@ antly to think that someone would take under@@ pants that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull the clothes off after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and did not wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident happening on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from front or back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
if you approach you from behind , you should turn yourself first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and move out of the firing line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with his knee in the bar and twist , while the attack@@ er bl@@ ends before pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while she direc@@ ts the gun on him .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot , grab the weapon and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and straigh@@ ten the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y it is best to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sha@@ kes his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a travel guide
a British travel@@ er with@@ drew his immune system and saus@@ ages of a serious test by le@@ aking out some of Europe &apos;s dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k took his course on a euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a fl@@ ushing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before dropping each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he will get in .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to light .
the thought of le@@ aking the r@@ ins@@ ing knob of a ten@@ si@@ le toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
luckily nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things .
from public money to railway stations to fl@@ ushing bones of toilets , the task assigned to his immune system definitely below a rehear@@ sal
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
compared to that , the lumin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick up after its lumin@@ ometer number was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of Da@@ iry products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve got in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dir@@ tier than that !
I won &apos;t lick anything here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of Da@@ iry Products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ o Senior Vice President of Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at while at the same time explaining the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me tell you - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I &apos;ve told him to lick up like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick it and others where it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social family &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destro@@ ys the del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation of social accommodation in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot;
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social apartment after a del@@ o@@ cation with a loss of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from the property , employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had holes , wooden boards were torn , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls .
the family was res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for home administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived temporarily in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted was fighting street fights with bas@@ eball bat , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive cries , stri@@ des and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be torn down under certain circumstances , old waste was found
in the property where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden boards were torn up
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing engaged her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the property , after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily move out .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have given the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the over@@ grown side of the community house rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the rent@@ ers were ab@@ used to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the final step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have bol@@ dly approached us and gave us the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message convey@@ ed that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ eting on the floor .
workers of the house administration will now have to remove rub@@ b@@ ish mountains , which surround the house
in 2014 the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don obtained a fine after own@@ ing the possession of a drug of class B in commercial indul@@ gence .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will navigate rent@@ ers who do not comply with the rules of the house
Angela C@@ row of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police informed that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not adhere to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can act without self @-@ repro@@ ach as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal pan@@ i@@ cked after an eff@@ or@@ tless military jet over@@ flies the beach
sun worshi@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ g@@ isi@@ es@@ che P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of the Air Force carried an unbelievable flight
the air forces admitted that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no risk of safety .
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists begin to panic after a ti@@ dy jet falls over a full beach .
dramatic video sho@@ ot@@ ings showed how the military aircraft flew nearly to the north of Portugal near the beach in Av@@ eiro .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they started to worry about the noise of the trou@@ gh plants without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro beach were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and thus had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the bad visibility in the vicinity , but the air forces insisted that safety at no time was at risk .
land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people on the island of Madeira came to death .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke smoke - which limited his sight .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona fights on Sunday for the first step towards the first title win in the new football season .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash climbs three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ winner must abst@@ ain from competing with the defeated Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reign@@ ing Europa League Champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
the German suffered a change in b@@ anding in the knee in the training , with which the en@@ quiries at Bar@@ ca had been clari@@ fied at least initially for the benefit of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er St@@ egen have been competing for the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique gave up a clear decision in this regard , leaving Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen , in most of the rest of the rest of the applicants , is taking advantage of this .
before the first mandatory game of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness level of the team at the Spanish master , who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ get@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know how to convince .
Sev@@ ille once again won the 2 : 3 defeat after an extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims to win the second triumph at the Super@@ cop@@ a de España .
with so far eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in its own league table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympics champion .
on Thursday , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the World Ranking List retri@@ eved the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ Tournam@@ ent and just Olympia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title one with each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top of the Olympia @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sets and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches .
they had pulled back on the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their prot@@ é@@ g@@ ents in a fair competition on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches until now have I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the finale I play for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expectedly un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma had really had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
after that he set the tempo on the top and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , the unexpected ro@@ using match did not develop .
but nevertheless there were enough stunning ball changes to be seen .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ ri@@ j , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had had a drift injury , but after that he had to settle with a sheet of steel .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were , by the way , in similar high table tennis @-@ old Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tr@@ ump acknow@@ le@@ dges &quot; form@@ id@@ able problems &quot; in election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now announced weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the multi @-@ lane Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire usually vo@@ iced concern about how correspon@@ dents said .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race within his own Republi@@ can camp , there are now doubts about his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bl@@ aming false reports on his candi@@ dat@@ ure , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sm@@ iles .
republi@@ can high @-@ bur@@ gers w@@ ack@@ le
U@@ tah is normally a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by the surv@@ ey@@ or , Tr@@ ump and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump ahead but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
there are also Arizona and Georgia as endangered .
in an interview with the sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question as to how he wanted to stop Clin@@ tons &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correc@@ tness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party is said to have threatened Tr@@ ump to cancel funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present better survey values .
instead , the candidates of the Republi@@ cans should be stronger under the arms of Congress .
Olympia : three @-@ part fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee immediately condemned a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told us that the former S@@ printer and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , passed a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich .
this was reported by the team leader Ken@@ yan from the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Federation asked the IO@@ C to obtain information about the case in order to make their own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesperson said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and expressed himself as F@@ erg@@ uson , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ken@@ yan head of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for the training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , Ken@@ yan &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics He@@ ads of He@@ ads , Michael Rot@@ ich , had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing attempts , Kenya has been under special supervision since a long time .
during the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls imposed by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was un@@ common that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic commen@@ cement .
as a result , the WA@@ DA took Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is con@@ forming with the rules of the WA@@ DA .
Kenya counts as a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of tel@@ ev@@ isions of the ARD , repro@@ aches were raised again and again that dop@@ ing agents are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sports bet@@ ru@@ gs .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he hired them in Russian athle@@ tics .
it was possible to prove that in this kind of sport there was a widespread and systematic idea .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Shakespeare &apos;s year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with it , a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ ather@@ ard Bern@@ steins &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director , Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classical music and filled with the role of Maria a youth mare .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members with nostal@@ gia to her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is wise , of course , na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , which is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , back then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics , and they are just as convincing today as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

the attorney Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was alleged that they were killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had decided to leave the war @-@ torn country and to return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good thing lies in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from the east of London asc@@ ended into a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as family was informed that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow in a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain candidates for Supreme Court in case of electoral victory in Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Senate in the Senate , is convinced that the presi@@ dency candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
Republi@@ cans in the Senate have been blocking Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will ap@@ point the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesperson of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clin@@ tons &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ cans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants nude cal@@ endar@@ s for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women and for men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ aned to release a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine distingu@@ ishes himself from Old@@ school Play@@ boys , as &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that the calendar also does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must return to the presentation of timeless and classic n@@ ak@@ edness where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release to publish the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish church reck@@ ons with mass @-@ cur@@ sed
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons on the short term with tens of thousands of protective @-@ seekers , who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes the President of the Association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expected a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government with@@ drew Kurdish strongh@@ olds for months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing within Turkey .
after the twisted put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees themselves , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of the association compla@@ ined of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
this means that Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or expelled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief of the association demanded that the Federal Government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; position itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is taking place against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len follow@@ er destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and kul@@ ars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as reported by the newspaper , relying on numbers from the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs , the Turks set the largest group of asylum entitled to asylum in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all recognised asylum @-@ seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey we do not find the benefits of war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
if the state election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because stupid as up to now it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and farm elections - that bites itself .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters , are on holiday .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers travelling in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so do not choose the country day .
there are practical problems : in the holidays there are hel@@ pers , infl@@ ating posters , infl@@ ating ballo@@ ons , distributing fl@@ yers and counting at the end , rub@@ bing only lab@@ orious .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to let the people pass over .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how strongly Neul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains in the end co@@ ali@@ tion@@ able remains .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one can see from his major posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame on the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ sten@@ ed the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make electoral campaigns at the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale documents ; Merkel &apos;s federal election district is in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U wai@@ ves the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noted that in the country you have to cut the base so that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any in the expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election fighter co@@ king to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , where people are : bri@@ st@@ les , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot is on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last stood at 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the parliament .
they make a modern virtue out of holiday hard@@ ship and move their campaign largely into the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it calls the national chairman Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green election warri@@ ors go on a search for domestic stimul@@ i among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ ates straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg L@@ akes and finds it even nice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabili@@ t@@ ated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 8 pm , there are all kinds of praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made everything a bit jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff of the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no default .
the construction site could be moved to the south on the weekend at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opposite is also commen@@ ded for those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to setting up residence drives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted , and so the connection to Rot@@ tenburg was restored , the traffic situation in the village was relaxed .
the citizens can now travel on both sides from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy head manager Florian King , responsible for the management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because there were many routes seeking and more familiar to their navigation device than the sig@@ nage .
the result was that some trucks were fran@@ king in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not met , the congregation joined the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who himself made himself competent on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been dup@@ lic@@ ated .
the fastest one was at 77 km / km in the speed 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for business people at the B 27 it is only a small consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the street is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 @-@ refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to revenue frac@@ tures can be seen through each one you ask .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; maximum slight drop , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that , of course , &quot; the run@@ way is missing . &quot;
the bars are most popular along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly known as Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only did it , but all the restaurants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we need to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the turnover in sales is estimated at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking has thrown back its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his employees have to be dismissed .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , District President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant benefit otherwise from the advantages of the location at the B 27 . now she must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous has been handled .
at all complaints G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 . it refers to the long history .
he is able to understand that other regular guests are less frequent now because of the complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t go down , it is also somewhere else nice .
after the restoration work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his pedi@@ cur@@ es return to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crisis with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
it is constantly being scre@@ wed to laws in the name of the fight against terrorism .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a big security package .
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ ati@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t demand anybody .
others , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I am also involved in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior he was in a position to offer him results and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has let a little time pass before he presents his conclusions for safety in the republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
a lot has already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , it is not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications on passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities also does not come as a surprise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère launches a second stop for proposals that had not been made with the SPD : he wants to face sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups and but@@ ton@@ y jihadi@@ sts with double nationality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U man ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this reasonable and also does not demand anything that the coalition partner has no chance anyway .
a few new ideas are presented by de Ma@@ izi@@ ère as well .
they sometimes have it in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted at the country are supposed to check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a safety check .
in the case of Dul@@ divor@@ ces for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of it is politically and legally hei@@ g@@ th .
some of them are still un@@ exploited and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the im@@ treatment of tolerated , for example - the question arises : what has this to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the kill@@ ers of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees .
and things that people deeply dealt with could not be cl@@ inging to election times .
the focus is on inner security .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election campaigns .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security .
in the past few days , it was between the two parties high .
only a gar@@ sty dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy idea collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the departments also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a ren@@ unci@@ ation of dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he holds nothing from a return from the double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
it is not sensible to re@@ introduce them .
and in a Bur@@ ka ban , he had constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it has yet to be demonstrated .
there is a lot of things to make for stri@@ fe .
but the SPD is also trying to benefit from the issue of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; chief of the party , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , first sign@@ alizes cau@@ ti@@ ously and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Volkswagen got off lightly .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery numbers are increasing worldwide .
but it does not run smoothly in all markets .
there are vor@@ ti@@ ces about a term in the recall action .
Volkswagen starts its delivery in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can further forward a plus despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the VW brand weak@@ ens mainly in Western Europe and thus again poll@@ uted the total sales , as announced in the Da@@ x company .
in July , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent fewer vehicles worldwide than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year month .
in the home market Germany the deliveries bag@@ ged almost one sixth .
as head of sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , the weaker figures from July brought the weaker figures to Europe less than in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have given them a reluct@@ ance to buy them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU also bur@@ dened , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the US , where the exhaust gas first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus for beech .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected household brand of Nieder@@ sachsen is still off lightly through the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent stands on 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler could further demonstrate a sales increase from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen was manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust gas test .
in Germany alone , VW is calling some 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
after retro@@ fitting the car , the car manufacturer put out a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate travel .
reason is legal refin@@ ement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee of re@@ engineered diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Monday , this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW fulfilled the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA full @-@ comprehen@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the warranty that , in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance , no deterioration occurs and all vehicle values that are relevant to type approval have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was said in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen also sees the possibility that customers come to a workshop for example half a year after their conversion - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when it comes to customer interest , it is important to avoid that in any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal , there is uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands p@@ uni@@ tive interest from rich savers in future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank head Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher Banken states of an individual case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should not be afraid to pay for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund back from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros in sight deposit accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100.000 euro are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 will be 400 euros a year in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time now , he has been protecting 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day on the other , and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the cost is now proceeding further .
to leave cash in the res@@ ores of Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four accidents , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank officer .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically un@@ feasible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is end@@ owed with wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she is paying for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the Co@@ operative Bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; currently no other banks are known to the cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which calcul@@ ates a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesman Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives compared to private customers is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is tough , and the emig@@ ration of investors against competition is threatening .
customers in Germany will not be able to please this in terms of width .
destination plates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle aged love records .
before you rush to the comment section to see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of non @-@ Al@@ le@@ a men &apos;s middle aged with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not due to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mi@@ sty mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record are all fores@@ ight at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ de through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers prefer their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending their own time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit , and wild@@ ly stu@@ ffed before I stop , hold my hands and say something special : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which independent vendors resi@@ ded - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , that I of Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle aged men ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men middle aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already treasure , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 s@@ labs .
these records pictured above ( he sent me the sn@@ apshot via e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford than appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early se@@ ven@@ ties , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was a bit too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend some time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers that he meets are applying to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records .
from the conversations that I have conducted , people usually have been dischar@@ ged so as to get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a store such as Ph@@ onica to realize that record shops offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to the WE@@ Z , some of the older customers received an impetus to the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers , of objects that evo@@ ke happy memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or possessing material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector , and I think it is so with many people .
it is an easy way to mentally focus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of staff fl@@ utes from a stack of plates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month had not listened to them yet .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own record players .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned as I smoo@@ ther through a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle aged men ) has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hic aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone came here just recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record so I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ intensive , less music @-@ class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly get in .
F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz re@@ conc@@ iles from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks stran@@ gely lonely , but trau@@ matic trau@@ mas are difficult to det@@ ain when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it is more of a window @-@ shop than a wholesale purchase .
it does not deserve much , so collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression to brave the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers could send into the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that sells most for luxury objects such as plates .
even if my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record stores and online forums , are not considered .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not having stro@@ lling through the record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets by plates while they avoid the star@@ tling look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who raises nothing susp@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
at a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to submit 72 temporary stores in which people within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , offer hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and which are a fire and disaster risk .
humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a L@@ ille court decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas are quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; Café of the camp , which is char@@ itable and provides 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &quot; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two help organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle @-@ bearing living has increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympics disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his disap@@ pointing appearance at the Olympic time , cycli@@ st Tony Martin does not want to be under@@ mined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep on keeping the World Cup in sight , remain confident and fight further , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has no explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyse in peace what reasons for the de@@ bac@@ le had led .
Martin really wanted to fight for the title at the time @-@ driving World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed lately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also includes my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who on Wednesday had lost 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes at Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers need to adapt to the next generation of speed meters : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are being tested , which are to be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabili@@ t@@ ated bridges with temporary speed polic@@ ing there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary flash for compliance with speed limits .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operation ; the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limit@@ ers and driving b@@ ans at time , driving stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art movement , the trailer can be moved with each car with trailer coupling .
so that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also sweat @-@ proof outer shell disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the lightning from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain takes silver in 7 @-@ ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji &apos;s Master@@ class Gold has recovered
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ 7 ru@@ g@@ by was an ab@@ rupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side st@@ eppe , back , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the defeat of the ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als the same day , could fall back on them in the final .
but irrespective of this , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it might be a consol@@ ation for UK - but probably it will not be - that at least one Br@@ ite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former head of England in Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , they lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan .
here they lost one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began to wonder and let the attacks jump off G@@ Bs for fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if they were running in running buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ sted in the corner .
with four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a squ@@ ir@@ rel of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain from Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but Fi@@ ji only stopped .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua reached a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re @-@ opening and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ breath@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u squee@@ zed through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning .
that &apos;s the way it is .
GB conducted fundamental changes at half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt at GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of South Os@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags wave and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ name put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked anni@@ hil@@ ated in the grass .
in the past , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal under the post in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , assured the winning - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inous gold than in these games and that will mean something .
from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , who enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only the two who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams was there when they row@@ ed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in succession without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport , which made such a y@@ ard@@ stick .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , her 3@@ 9.@@ ter idle bet , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of wild hel@@ pers who make the difference and no one was more powerful than the trainer who did not know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that did it .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a very bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that was the right concept under such circumstances .
I needed money , so it had to go better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient .
this is how it begins .
rowing on itself is a challenge , but it makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ stirring morning more than usual talking and trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was the Captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s maybe a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much mine and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked for me .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he &apos;s the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with it .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught in the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let oneself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for something great .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
the managing director of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ally exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water association as a model for large water producers .
some time ago , it was written in the original on a contribution by the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
a little later the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia acknowledged the con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the compulsory association of employees , of which 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , Breit@@ brunn municipality , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water every year and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the congreg@@ ations Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ah .
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brunn Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water atten@@ dant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Con@@ federation in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very varied and they asp@@ ire to water cat@@ ch@@ ment and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions at weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchase in the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high tanks ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .
there have been no stand@@ still and I have always added innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ dati@@ o she praised God &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service over the past 31 years .
he has established himself with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose band@@ age , and he has literally lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a lot of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Water Minister Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water atten@@ dant and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and the restructuring of the association &apos;s association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were the rup@@ ture in the high tank at Kirch@@ hoff on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained by filling the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko openly deals with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to speak about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great stri@@ des , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die .
the eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago , however , is well ahead and is now learning privately in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something , which is two years behind when I sang at La Scala , he re@@ members nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est person on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting at risk of life
on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator should be on the run , and after him will be publicly punished .
now nationwide , because Sven S. may be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
in the meantime , the man carries a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the gun , so the police .
anyone who sees Sven S. should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
in the first place , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to give any information about the de@@ mis@@ e or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; but she confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a crime fiction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains un@@ affected by additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity production are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains with the release from the Renew@@ able Energy Transi@@ tion in the components of the so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 per cent falls .
but even these will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for its own electricity generation .
this will largely determine the status quo of the current regulation .
Gabriel contributed to the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be weighed for the reform of the emissions legislation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann stated in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation was further exac@@ erb@@ ated when the world &apos;s largest producer country China threw steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers are throwing price d@@ umping Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased somewhat .
on the one hand , imposed import duties show effect on import steel , on the other hand the economic prospects in China were bri@@ gh@@ tened up .
it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least the prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the sector responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
last but not least Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the steel business association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the quantity produced went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association expects an increase in orders in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the Leh@@ ra@@ mt studies she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing moves me emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind .
because singing is from several perspectives a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
by regular gather@@ ings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts .
because often social and family structures in old age dissolve , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this , sen@@ iors are training deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand their lungs are not so quickly out of the pu@@ ff in everyday life .
singing is an optimal hobby when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at age .
singing is often a very special effect on older people , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Senioren @-@ Organisationen .
in the older generations , joint singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially the melodies often ent@@ angle dementia suffer@@ ers for long @-@ term events .
singing will also require a special performance to the head , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone do not only focus on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise something for a long time , I become better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there &apos;s enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound comes next to it ?
in search of the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces sings in a senior choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer views over the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
anyone who wishes to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly .
many senior choir members can also be found on the Internet .
if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , your family , friends or neighbors can ask for help from Internet searches .
anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is doing good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for every age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than han@@ go@@ vers on scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect has the effect of rowing kit@@ tens on adult animals .
to her surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of exc@@ itation of kit@@ tens in the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they react ten percent faster to Lau@@ te von K@@ ätz@@ chen , who in great need choose how scientists from the Veter@@ inary School and the Medical School Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) have found out .
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the rep@@ ut@@ ations of kit@@ tens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed kit@@ tens are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous examination , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ tens is different with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight female females were observed from the livestock farming of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a herd of little ones , which were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of more excited kit@@ tens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers maintain their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who didn &apos;t have their own offspring , responded differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they swi@@ vel@@ ed faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls played the more excited kit@@ tens .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop@@ ped with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males at all responded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men on baby noise several times in humans .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , whether they were pregnant or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Super@@ cup &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r has issued an arrest warrant against the former soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match will take place in Turkey .
before the Du@@ eling of the ore @-@ ri@@ vals between Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even with the exception of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , should not be com@@ promised .
however , this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
even before football it is not stopped .
the prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant against the former strong @-@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r .
according to this , the South East living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kis@@ r is said to be a follow@@ er of Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the state of emergency imposed for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact it has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has ended Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the Bes@@ ik@@ tas &quot; club traditionally do not count towards the President &apos;s friends .
but what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially the arrival of Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne city of Cologne demonstrated his athle@@ tic value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top sc@@ orer of his club .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disap@@ pointing season for the record champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the round K.@@ o in the Champions League the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leave early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g it was just sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made it , and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ protecting King laid the foundation for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
after the coup attempt at AC Florence , he had announced only borrow@@ ed Gom@@ ez following the coup attempt to not return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Má@@ ri@@ ó wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the storm would have to be ready to give up about a third of the annual salary of 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay &quot; his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als opportunities at Olympia in Rio
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin &apos;s 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin has been locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova must not start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is still the head@@ lines for the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had pla@@ gu@@ ed her first charter just before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was raff@@ led out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters chest ) .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenario : with a raised smile she was still stum@@ bling into the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was clear that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a che@@ ering tower .
but there are many other athletes , who go to the start at the Rio Olympics in spite of the ping @-@ ping past .
here is an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 year old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he has been locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and former world champion has been running even faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to reti@@ re in 2010 after taking the pain@@ killer Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after having suffered severe tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defending herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 Olympic Champion of 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 , has been positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane .
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ encing and was blocked for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold favourite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and locked 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement has been responsible , eu@@ than@@ ized mar@@ ries .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ a ) : hardly any athlete has been awarded so many med@@ als afterwards .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later after he was found testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave the Olympic Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European Championship because of testosterone abuse .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is in rank two of the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world champion and gold favourite has only been tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year old world champion , references to the capture of a forbidden dietary supplement have been found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran already on July 13 .
bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokesman of the State Department , Thomas Sch@@ nö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cutting wounds and had been treated at the hospital , but had already left this hospital again .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on also Austrian citizens are still unclear .
in this respect , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok , initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , among them the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and another man was killed , according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ on@@ ation near the seaside resort Pat@@ ong who was popular with tourists .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal employee .
according to the authorities , the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed before the territory of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g called for several injured on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ eastern coast .
one assumes a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express itself about possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage that is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , one assumes that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
the authorities have kept secret notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days , but they were not informed of the exact time and places .
the group behind the attacks is still unclear .
the police told her officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they do not judge tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in there is a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after clas@@ hes between security forces and Muslim populations , it is not necessary to travel to these provinces before the necessary trips . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elabor@@ ated by the jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to bring chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , will benefit themselves to restore the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the insur@@ gency of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hind@@ u Shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several regional offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see at the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; indications of aspir@@ ations against the free democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Commissioner Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ier of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are watching the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that his authority was closely aligned with the local authorities when deciding on the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Federal Constitutional Court .
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a more you@@ thful language , often with pop music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists are just as extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an ad@@ orable advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are especially suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; recently it had reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the constitutional protection , potential contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes its direction and becomes extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have an influence on the party .
this is not recognis@@ able .
with a view to the marked increase in legitimate off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and asylum seekers , Ma@@ dad said he would not speak of a new right @-@ wing terrorism in this context .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years we have found that there can be justi@@ fiable structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a German@@ - wide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were worried that there were many attacks on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum accommodation have not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences that have had nothing in common with legal extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , have become radi@@ cal@@ ised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records will not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weigh@@ ted s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia swa@@ m so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old completed his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly athle@@ tic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special status from the International Swimming Federation .
this is distributed to promote swimming in under@@ represented countries .
since most athletes are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te just wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ b of the W@@ hale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter outdoor style , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i ensured media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete alone over 100 meters of free style .
m@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at the time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not look so close to the lo@@ oming electoral defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is speaking at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already been an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it would not matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either work either , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ cans in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC .
if it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correc@@ tness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
so he called US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance formed .
mail goes into trading with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter also .
soon the corporation wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the postal service will also be offering its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market from the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been examining whether to sell their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , to sell to other companies .
post @-@ board Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always re @-@ questions , for example by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bonn group wants to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift in its post @-@ production plant .
Ger@@ des announced that the company wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a long @-@ term adjustment to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership steps down after disap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair by CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him .
turbul@@ ences at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after once again disap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the worldwide number Five of the industry is facing a new beginning .
the Management Board will leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert is already leaving the Supervisory Board effective September 12 .
as early as September 1 , the management of the Executive Board will take over the current board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , who shared the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; executive speaker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to mention a company spokesman on Friday .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in investor circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders were ultimately disappointed with the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K peak since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fruits of restructuring aren &apos;t yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last poor Gf@@ K business figures , every investor would eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would do the qu@@ and@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the Company could not stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent below the comparable year @-@ earlier quarter .
sales in the first half of the year shr@@ ank by 3.4 per cent with 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros .
in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter have imp@@ acted the Group &apos;s lower value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the Group &apos;s business value depreci@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business area , gave the Group a loss of 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K had generated consolidated net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus slides into cla@@ ws in tren@@ ches : eight injured
in an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( county of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries and told the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to avoid her details to a vice vice , who partly drove on the counter @-@ track .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ pped into a tren@@ ch , as a spokesperson of the police Aur@@ ich / Wit@@ t@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the passengers .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the scene of the accident at Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ Hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck to report to the police .
the fee per cubic meter of sewage is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste water plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of so far 2,@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the waste water charge will increase again later if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a higher rate of calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the household by the District Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach found that for these sewage plants sub@@ floor coverings are running .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is committed to operating the facilities in a cost @-@ effective manner .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ chen@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg will have to reach deeper into the wal@@ let .
revenue increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed the committee , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary .
over the period between October 2016 and September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period can also be equ@@ aled .
Schmidt explained that there are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water waste , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the wastewater volume in all three systems is slightly declining .
in addition , in the past calculation period , renovation and repair costs were significantly affected by all three systems due to their age .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for the world market , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years old .
Schmidt noted that the mechanical ventilation system in the wastewater facility Az@@ endorf had to be replaced due to damage .
in the pumping station Wel@@ chen@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and the first sewage pond had to be disposed of , the sewage slu@@ dge disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses included the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water waste in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; fully sm@@ ashed . &quot;
Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs in the waste water plants in the past 20 years , has been spar@@ ed .
the situation for the above @-@ mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long run , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater association could not be expanded , because it is a deficit facility .
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria amounted to 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 1,@@ 0 % , i.e. monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport ( 1.8 % ) ; Free time and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critici@@ zed as an Asian cartoon
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can turn yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bl@@ unt , self @-@ winding tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ fies per day .
all false appearances come to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past when they were accused of promoting Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them sli@@ gh@@ ty eyes , false teeth and dark@@ ened che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es showed a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and indign@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat shared that it would have turned off the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was meant as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced racism reminded the filter of offen@@ ding c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the Ani@@ me comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet about the photos were widely distributed that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and mil@@ dly said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osi@@ tion of a very reluct@@ ant Asi@@ atic car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ proof , but that the yel@@ lowing face has been pulled into the de@@ fle@@ cted extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could tend to expect sensitivity .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such items remain un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and others to do the same .
in an essay on media and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices at Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leaders and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chin@@ es@@ ich @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Sn@@ ap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat declined to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokesperson , the company recently set up a human resource manager focusing on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu also said that she will leave her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fied IS@@ IS intelligence , re@@ jects Committee of Congress
military personnel from the United States Central Command have changed intelligence to record an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the actual conditions on the ground allowed , an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday .
the draft report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Committee Committee , Secret Service Commit@@ tees and the Military Com@@ miss@@ ariat , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command Intelligence Agen@@ cies who reported how superi@@ ors changed their appreciation to US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence , which is typically sc@@ aled by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly marked a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a newspaper article to the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
the guide errors in the Cent@@ com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from mid @-@ 2014 to mid @-@ 2015 , Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to record the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports from the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ com &apos;s reports is underway by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Defense Ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments of IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; said the High@@ est Dem@@ ok@@ rat in Com@@ rade tea , a member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the release of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the moral of analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave exc@@ essively enough room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there was no evidence of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor who was included in the complaint of Cent@@ com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon press spokesman , issued a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress , while the General In@@ spec@@ tor &apos;s investigations were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the issue of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that has meanwhile been made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question as far as President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of intermedi@@ aries of more than ten years ago , when Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , saw a written document on how the then government under George W. Bush saw only a small occupation force in Iraq , and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker states that contrary to the statements of the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s &apos;s former commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation during a hearing before the Senate .

one day after she had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a worthy performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember having done this ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their gates in mind .
however , she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will win the first and second place each .
first placed , the strong Dutch will take a little longer from the path that the other group leads .
as always the game may start on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they ended up in the last of 12 places at the last London Games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years had a hockey club in her hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , a coach of the National Team , began to turn things better .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said .
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have completely carried away the ru@@ dder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the near area .
India was gone without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the match from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved in the middle and kno@@ cked the ball in the gate to give the American a 2 @-@ 0 guidance .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the goal keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Bri@@ g@@ gs , who so far had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re in good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amidst the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the Rio de Janeiro events feel constant and inevitable , a rapid relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod that is handed down from the cross@@ bow arch@@ ers to a gym@@ n@@ astic for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ verk@@ y , or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a black s@@ warm with dimples , could certainly have been among those known names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting gold in Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , partially in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it reign for a long time .
but if I should make a modest argument for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although jumping on the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ se for the last 16 years that many people , I had questioned , did not know that it is actually an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had an athlete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider character , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the one that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast .
it has a humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ish tre@@ mor of his never to end pop @-@ up - but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rising vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before landing on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympic program , they are assessed according to the execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes to the finish , sometimes down and down , up and down at the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall , but also another high goal in television transmission : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel when looking at these games as something ti@@ ring .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the women &apos;s qualification and en@@ cir@@ cle@@ ment will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final laps as part of an afternoon block at both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the an@@ thro@@ po@@ ids and obj@@ ectivity of male athletes - as the male U.S. Tur@@ ner recently proposed according to the The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to come to air .
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testi@@ fied that tens of thousands of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police at gun@@ shots .
is Ethiopia pulling together ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the response of the government was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses testi@@ fied that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
videos currently circul@@ ating on the protests , probably from the last or early this year , show how security officers beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a detailed investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was constra@@ ined , while dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest it breaks off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ mobil , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
after a far @-@ critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of O@@ ga@@ den have been forced to exploit the turbul@@ ence over the past few years and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess still explo@@ de under the surface after years of intoler@@ ance .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media since cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they were so protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ per@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered mainly in Christian High@@ lands , in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but that also changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many of Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the Tig@@ ray ethnic group , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 .
he was considered a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special commission@@ ers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after prot@@ esting thousands of votes that were seemingly obsc@@ ured by the government and subsequently stolen by the analysts .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it was less than in the last months and this period of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it adop@@ ts a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ ish city , run by Tig@@ ray conduct business and hate the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests spread the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights on the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it closed this base .
while West@@ ern@@ ers want to support democracy clearly , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by ang@@ ing that his repeatedly repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , would have been the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelli@@ gi@@ bly to the American public .
it also brings together his comrades who strive to protect him during an event@@ ful phase in order to explain the peculiar position of which he could not have meant .
having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump returned to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to interpret , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism r@@ att@@ les to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand values .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
when talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech bored .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he received strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course I said that sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one linguistic boundaries in politics and then back up as needed .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates .
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more corro@@ sive tone as his survey values have continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a tour with a large margin in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries to un@@ ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative pron@@ oun@@ cements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ atively his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advoc@@ ates of Tr@@ ump , gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani to the correc@@ tness of Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements questioning whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this sense , it is true that , before Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back @-@ b@@ anded , completely false , and that &apos;s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq .
most mainstream Republi@@ cans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out by taking control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and being taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ aned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked Mr Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ology as only a further proof that he was un@@ fit for the presi@@ dency .
once crowded at the price of the market , Café is back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ amy café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which you could only pay cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
soap Cher@@ ie business , replacing the verb in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native people used it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ ann@@ on wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea hotel is exemp@@ ted and is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is a change , then it &apos;s also new discovery .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long@@ time associate of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he began to work at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ nish@@ ings like cap@@ ers and aci@@ dic onions .
there are natural rice bowls .
the café does not serve beer any more , there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and visited the verb regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb was shut , she gave up the coffee for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she put a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a loyal and loyal customer since the beginning of the decline in 2003 .
he went there before work and inv@@ ari@@ ably always tried the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss watch @-@ clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of soap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;re going to go to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new client transl@@ ates the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has preten@@ ded to post@@ p@@ one her soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice restaurant wishes to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to an adjacent building .
a new verb is enough for many customers to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt felt that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a foo@@ die , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies on Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Water Tor@@ to@@ ise Sou@@ p .
its menu on this day was a little more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the United States , while Bri@@ ck@@ man told her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , snork@@ eling snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Ziegel@@ man , 54 , placed a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable blend ate .
as the re@@ porter noted h@@ acking , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abundant food was very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked pastries for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the ways with which the country has moved to be no longer the land of Cock@@ a@@ ig@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was equally ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le was considered a &quot; wonderful species , lef@@ to@@ ver food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely servi@@ ced luxury .
strange mix@@ tures have been tried out , as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has priority over taste or even healthy kitchen@@ ware .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
as never before or since , house@@ wives - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - are the eating habits of the country in such a way .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e as creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly tasty are the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ Cake food stance .
while publicly commen@@ cing the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the millions @-@ heavy man of the world he has become .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cooking like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was really strange to reality .
President Roosev@@ elt might have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to post@@ p@@ one an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors caused by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was disc@@ arded as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple tried to better understand the eating habits of Ziegel@@ mans mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man rec@@ alled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag @-@ incident .
after the dishes were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e brought forth a dessert that they had cooked at home : the pl@@ um recipe that President Roosev@@ elt did eat at lunch .
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , adding that it was a common plo@@ y to miss a fancy name .
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only prun@@ es , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ vul@@ ged a little bit reluct@@ antly in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ bers .
amaz@@ ingly , it didn &apos;t taste bad .
CO@@ E took three times a second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ th@@ ener he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life into play to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of White Helm@@ ets , a group of civilians who , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own lives in the game to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and help them first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Civil Guard , which shows him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as heroes he never saw himself , he said , according to the image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die in saving lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters cast four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie will only get offspring with 150 years .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the North Atlantic coast , in an hour it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it matters is the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to sat@@ te 2,@@ 6 km / h - and with this top speed half as fast as a seal .
this lifestyle marked by slow@@ ness seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ an@@ ity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life @-@ span , which means verteb@@ rates a world record . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist probably assumed that Greenland was stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie is hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland shar@@ k .
their slow motion sen@@ sed them when they buried six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
this sh@@ arks nevertheless make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for cad@@ a@@ vers that tor@@ ment from higher water layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks using the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s , when atomic weapons search for larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the 220 centimet@@ ers length of the third @-@ minute animal , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons tests , it should have celebrated its 50@@ th anniversary in its investigation in 2012 .
on the other hand , all the larger Greenland shar@@ k @-@ sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in its lens nucle@@ us , which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res would be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign the length an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably at the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the increase obviously leaves at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is likely to be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such methane al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old har@@ poon tip was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flames .
so they mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
the loss of heat from one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than in one gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Sch@@ euer@@ lein the evolutionary bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal , on the other hand , should invest more in a long life .
building site in a double pack
the Municipal Council has focuss@@ ed on topics relating to construction in the latest session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee adopted the announcement of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated housing areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and exhaus@@ tion issues have been clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - extension section 1 ) is nothing more in the way of interested parties .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau appeal to young families and former sen@@ iors .
as it was said , construction volunteers can now announce themselves in the town hall , the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session .
in order to make inquiries about the settlement of further business enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
thus , the city on the Main has the best chances of attracting new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether funds should continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , approval in the UK is enough for them so far .
they are using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , according to the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance len@@ i@@ dency E@@ IO@@ PA and the high @-@ risk ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , though , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , it also cuts off in the infrastructure as well as Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
furthermore , the city is occupied with readily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the management consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city ranked seventh , Luxemburg in place 19 , Dublin in No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European inland market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my business researchers .
in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal expenses from hepatitis C patent law@@ suit with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. magi@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs resulting from H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C law@@ suit with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liberated from a compensation payment amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which was related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a U.S. judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the law@@ suit was filed on Thursday , US judge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a reduction in costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medication that can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck su@@ ed each other and claim ownership on laboratory work to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir landed , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State

the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) comb@@ ing after the extract of the remaining group of fighters buried within the city are currently the city .
they freed more than 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters allied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are doing home@@ work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons deserve 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published their tax return on Friday for 2015 , which resulted in US presidential nom@@ ine@@ e and her husband &apos;s income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Clinton donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton delivered almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aren ; former Secretary of State announced an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book about her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons candidate for the vice @-@ president , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , published his tax declarations over the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hiding behind false statements and re@@ treats regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not oblig@@ ated to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax check by the tax authorities for their refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Democrats candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , a special advis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before the tax inspections are not completed .
the critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions about assets , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his business , and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already top@@ pled on the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump calls on the release of his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke about the issue during a speech about the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what each other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s , and a New York Times business journalist quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors that indicated that this could still be the case .
in the election campaign , federal taxes have become a topic .
Clinton is supporting a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett called for a meeting to discuss their tax returns with Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away &apos;s industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax check of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from voters and not from tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has been published back to the year 2007 .
Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the Clin@@ tons &quot; tax return from 2015 showed that this only $ 100 of its income was paid as wages , unlike most Americans .
their major investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works support Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea for years ago , intensified its promotion along with the US conservation of nature by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non@@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without inj@@ uring animals .
before , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is the day of the world , dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants out of their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi @-@ cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned on to the ignition switch .
when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der in the air .
a hint is usually already sufficient to chase the elephant .
a last option is a shi@@ pper that shoots a gold @-@ fired power plant into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a matter of principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed location on the shores of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk is not suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director breaks Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call was removed - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots has un@@ le@@ ashed a media insurrection after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin has not listed an Israeli code since it claimed Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the hotel &apos;s list of countries .
the country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there was &quot; scho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was even more angry in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; said the employee of Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were app@@ alled and upset by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big resonance on the internet where people called it a scandal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of them subordin@@ ate to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indul@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged calls for Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all charges and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel into the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokesman of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police put tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students came together with the police on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police deployed tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to find out what caused the police to install rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of São Paulo Ger@@ ald Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are being implemented to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters saw gra@@ ff@@ iti spra@@ ying against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets in crowds to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the exchange rate between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly , the ambassador said .
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trading is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it noted that trading turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved through deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan continues this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian representative issued approximately 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries affecting the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia of last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians attend Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witnesses sought : beverage market inf@@ ested in forest fires &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening was carried out on the Be@@ we XXL beverage market on the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the ons@@ lau@@ ght of a gun , three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ mi@@ red their faces , took the issu@@ ance of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver coloured VW Golf .
the police do not share how much money was captured .
the cul@@ pr@@ its should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the raid , the perpetrators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and have escaped from the gravel car park located opposite the parking house entrance , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ derer ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime , which are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , should urgently report to the police .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ oc@@ al Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage to Freiburg .
four stages were dealt with together .
in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the mini@@ stries in the next two years , the mini@@ stries around St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a several @-@ day pilgri@@ m hike .
various pilgrimage destinations were tested and finally decided for the Bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where in this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the open gate of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral .
16 Min@@ is of Bit@@ tel@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the holy chambers , went their way .
in the evening before , Fr . Stor@@ k sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims &apos; crosses and distributed the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing .
from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ en@@ ster Our Lady stands and so the Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s Way from the Mu@@ en@@ ster was taken .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field @-@ crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeat@@ ed@@ ely set up R@@ ast to sing a song from a specially compiled pilgri@@ m &apos;s booklet .
for the over@@ nights , the parish homes of the local par@@ ishes were at their disposal .

on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
after the end of the day , we went to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting route , but had to climb some 500 meters in the heat of the heat and then climb again .
the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bathroom wei@@ her in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing conv@@ ent church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is met in the late afternoon at Frei@@ burger Münster , passing through the gates of mercy .
with a small impulse , God thank@@ ed God .
the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the city metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite Gold is ring@@ ing for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ged last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ age that his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after taking a modest sixth place at the London train world championships despite the arrival of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the hitch@@ hi@@ ker Jamie staff .
they did this in good time as a Hin@@ der .
Ho@@ ys retired gave a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who prevailed four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner prevailed in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , Hin@@ der was close behind , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that Hin@@ der drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a flat@@ tering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we have set up an Olympi@@ ar@@ ord in the final round and the world champi@@ ons are defeated .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell onto the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole UK flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle current .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is in the range of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys win of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were more good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ chman W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometers .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on security .
he had fought with officers before the qualification yesterday , when function@@ aries called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and ended tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Kor@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in World Record Time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong train cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
there were drama in the background , so the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex and mo@@ bbing repro@@ aches , as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
the future of the melt production of Port@@ land due to the abolition of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium mel@@ tdown from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers &quot; workplaces - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus will lift all supply contracts as the supplying energy company shared .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year to not give any further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2,000 work@@ stations in the area of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2,000 work@@ stations - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melting plant consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation of Vic@@ tori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded the point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
this step follows the long @-@ standing speculation on the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium sm@@ el@@ tery with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land will continue to operate , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; said the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the Tre@@ aties were called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have been in force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in fiscal 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L income from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong fut@@ ures prices for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual statement amoun@@ ting to $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to exp@@ ire the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to run the melt , or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; does not interfere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which should have come into force from November this year , even if there is still one explanation why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn of the industry &apos;s poor economic conditions before the possible closure of the melt mill in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements made by the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts per year to consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity per year .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generator , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a car@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the sought @-@ after September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , vi@@ cious reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z On@@ cology and Produc@@ ers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classical turn : they all have planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é @-@ like act of almost every birthday cake of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest gave the sentence &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon girl on a broadcasting station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun with certainty .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim might have beaten her , regarding the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself .
the September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that is more similar to an illustrated book than a fashion journal , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Acc@@ ording Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover star is so eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine le@@ aked before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that model@@ ed &quot; than &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers does not like success to everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers has always been a bit ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ oe of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were again boiling up when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but there seems to be a point of passing along the gri@@ m .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the true sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ ming of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community centers assign 160@@ ,000 people per year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s assistance units are rejected annually by the community centers , while the sector is preparing for the impact of other funding cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gues and similar - are rejected for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already fully utilized , are prepared for further reductions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell community centers said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only get worse without a lifting of the decision of the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people from important services you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave non@@ violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ ju@@ stly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the Chief Prosecutor and Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customers , and that Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k &apos;s government inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after employee allegedly drew a gun
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after telling her that her campaign manager for North Carolina was shooting a gun for an employee in February , while she was travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte &apos;s Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been waiting for months to have been waiting for the matter to be internally controlled before it realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of battle , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; he said in his indictment .
after compla@@ ining to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he gave up in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired in order to do harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosecution only comes two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered an uph@@ eav@@ al when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and judges should ap@@ point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Campa@@ ign &apos;s Campa@@ ign made it clear that the media would have torn his words out of the context and that he would not inc@@ ur violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of duty of care and Philip due to bodily injury and lasting psychological damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
it was not re@@ acted to calls from its consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has previously managed a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
at the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses are recorded for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could barely rule in the North , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances to continue to pose the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 per cent a year ago .
according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could again rise to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 per cent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in parliament .
despite light losses , the Gre@@ ens were reluct@@ ant to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite light losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
the N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the parliament with 3 per cent each .
according to the survey , the SPD ( SPD ) according to the survey was only 23 percent ( vote 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they still stood behind the Gre@@ ens at 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but on the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , whereas the pirates would miss the move by contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia became a communic@@ ator on the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the unit weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ unk@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would suff@@ ice today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to stores exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros lovers can buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the west pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible using HTML browser , albeit dist@@ antly slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , that is about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
today , the market is dominated by suppliers who all come a lot later as Nokia .
being online always and everywhere , this is a daily routine for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales of the devices are around € 400 billion .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a complete industry has ar@@ isen around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only beginning in early 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs on Mac @-@ World announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator to use everything via touch screen easily .
the triumph of Apple began , still today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had seen the following .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
20 years after his invention , the smartphone is a matter of course .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we ran a great effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will already provide 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think the challenge of the expansion He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ ant on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ler had wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row as well .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in fun growth and a legacy of skills and employment both to leave the airport and throughout the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion on private investment .
the London games from 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ play &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are the same . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block displays on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop side would change the coding on its advertisements in order to make it difficult for indicating the recognition of which part of the advertising site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that there was a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokesman of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the upcoming open source community and the b@@ yp@@ ads has already been underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered into the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying banners have become the industry .
according to a study from the past year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe some 200 million people use display lock@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues .
the company has refra@@ ined from displaying ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , sharing a speaker .
advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large share of revenue , so Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would be updating its &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; to give people more control over them .
on Thursday , Facebook affir@@ med that adding new filters would be wor@@ rying because they would also block contents on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the user , so we plan to address the issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokesman in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have instead focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control into the hands of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; woman in presum@@ able suicide over Swiss highway &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police inv@@ oked witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday over@@ rode a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay down in the dark , &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman wanted to kill himself at the age of 49 , that of several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police told them , as well as any witnesses of the incident to report themselves .
an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter granted the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person walked in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers must not assume that a pedestrian goes on the motorway in the middle of the night as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after she had passed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street , took the court .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhabited .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies NASA have developed a model to explore the past of Venus by means of tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine if the Venus could have re@@ buff@@ ed similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still slowly rot@@ ated .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from fast evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus exhibits its day @-@ through @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution , previously thought by planet researchers .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans dark@@ ened and their water vap@@ or was fired away from ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect back -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins the A@@ val@@ an@@ che as a trainer
Patrick Roy joined the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che as trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations on Thursday and led to a low co@@ determination right in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , Chairman / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek for a new coach .
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
I have been thinking long and a lot about how I could improve this team in the course of the summer , to give it more depth , it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly aligned with the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the team &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had been hired by Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and we wish him the best for the future .
Roy was recognized as the best trainer of the League during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award .
he took the association on 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the low season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference by five points .

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks again , strike out strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles regarding the remun@@ eration for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties for a new round of talks sit at the table , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group service provider Wood Group have been spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the development process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will stop a few full @-@ day sessions over the coming weeks , starting next year to tackle the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , the Wood Group has cut rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent , due to negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s rating follows a 10 percent reduction in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts to the company provide the space needed to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alizes its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ unification with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotary rates under the stars of the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate at different rates and in which connection the rot@@ ational periods are associated with the formation of planets .
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the Earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now fastest .
to peak @-@ rotation rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars colli@@ de with great amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star ages , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates suggests that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es stars with dancers , with bigger stars turn more slowly than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotary rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to learn more about how , when and why stars slow their rotation rates and so to speak hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 year old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declared the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract awarded him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future act as a consultant and a youth coach - with full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ olog@@ s , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle mar@@ in@@ ers ( 1994 @-@ 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mile@@ stones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys only two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar values .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be accepted into the rest Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as early as 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 having taken forbidden ster@@ oids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal up to the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as the prime suspect for years to have received performing funds via an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at the time swe@@ eter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also its farewell @-@ days do not run no@@ is@@ elessly .
while many bas@@ eball legends get the big stage in their last games Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a goodbye tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win each game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Yan@@ ke@@ es Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , was married to the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , sympathy and admir@@ ation of the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the fans sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing occur@@ ren@@ ces .
a trained athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre barrier runner Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions , these messages come to the un@@ timely .
in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been proven , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Court of Justice CA@@ S confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly , just 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en should have participated in the courses of over 50 m free style .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires a full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio , the news of the positive trial in Dan@@ ek@@ ova was le@@ aking , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the athle@@ tic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O is supposed to act in the forbidden substance .
Dan@@ i@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v returned promptly with criticism of the athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t pull the proper conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for instance , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ed nation should not participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class to 85 kg , was tested on the an@@ aboli@@ c ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both may start in@@ gest@@ ing , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova &apos;s fall is another severe blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Federation IA@@ AF has banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , even the runner @-@ up nation of Kenya produces many bad news in Rio .
in the swimming @-@ sport , the former bre@@ aches in China also ensured violent clas@@ hes between the athletes .
so the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ els li@@ lac . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the Podium for 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun stood at the heart of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positively tested in the Chinese championships in 2014 for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to be locked only a three month lock .
data L@@ oss : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ jack hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeted companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey of malware infection specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , the UK and Germany , 40 percent of the companies surv@@ eyed in the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes several victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 % of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observation of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to rede@@ em the ran@@ som is considerably higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a frigh@@ tening fast evolution of malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes head Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski talking to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising .
then discovered the perpetrators of black@@ mail software .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was terri@@ fying quickly in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim actively , it seeks to systematically search for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the requirements of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the final cryp@@ tion code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production stops .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of German companies affected sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to stop business operations completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
several hospitals have already been victims of attacks in Germany , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of stal@@ em@@ ate in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ acker in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the investig@@ ators of F @-@ Secure have investigated the use areas and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they account to their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct access to freely accessible support sites , or de@@ code for free example files .
and if private people are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must in part negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to retrieve their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers become more professional and share their work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the antivirus company Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is about three or four persons .
the program@@ mers sell their malware then in the form of a software module to the actual black@@ mail .
the so @-@ called Malware @-@ Kits were created by the malware itself , counsel@@ ing and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included in delivery is a fitting tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .

the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey are confident that Ran@@ som@@ ware can handle backup @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful completion , the perpetrators are threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the potential damage potential is much higher , depending on the type of data .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
it sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work closely at any place .
the interior materials are well @-@ finished and pleasant , only the cockpit of the cockpit is a little bit off .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ level and 10@@ 26 l in the back of the back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back@@ rest can be folded up like a seat chair and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the ground up to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to make his work a little qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering seems to be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment of the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency brake assist ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and lane keeping assistant .
the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the remote light assistant works very reliably .
and the smart speed controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if required .
the full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI @-@ socket lie underneath the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel engines are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
the HR @-@ V offers Honda a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not responsible : fall on air passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only in case of danger that is typical of aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee injury during the fall .
but the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .

sick holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is indu@@ bit@@ ably found in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven the same symptoms .
during the trial , a family on the second day of their door@@ step was difficult to suffer from diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their disease caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to return to a defective wastewater treatment plant , which supposedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family felt that the trip was so poor - and compla@@ ined against the promot@@ er .
in court , the pla@@ inti@@ ffs did not have any success .
indeed , the treatment plant was in fact defective .
but the organizer only learned about it shortly before departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was al@@ right .
so he did not viol@@ ate his information duties , according to the judgment .
no contam@@ in@@ ants found in the samples of the water .
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gi@@ on among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be calm and determined at the same time to react to terrorism .
it is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division .
we won &apos;t treat this triumph to the terrorists .
if criminal offen@@ ders need to leave the country more quickly , however , this increases safety and strength also the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personal strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over a number of years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over a number of years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting the sympath@@ ies of terrorism must be punished again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ar@@ mis@@ sibility will be am@@ ended so that especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet is ham@@ pered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recently much discussed duty of confidentiality for physicians is to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to search for solutions , how the danger of citizens can be reduced , he said with a glance at psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the minister needs a better social care .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the char@@ ters in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a general ban on full @-@ wear is not constitu@@ tionally problematic .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything one re@@ jects , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .

&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and tigh@@ tening of residence permit people in this country no longer security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway junction
it st@@ ows on the b@@ ypass road regularly - here is a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this should change : the legal ab@@ bi@@ eg@@ ation should be prolonged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic on the road every evening in traffic , when they drive over the motorway from Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the state @-@ run road construction will be extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße the legal ab@@ ut@@ ment lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then cycle right from the hammer road on the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is divided early , whereby the total rest is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the fe@@ eder nerves the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the way back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h way and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic is only guided in one lane across the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt in a good three @-@ four@@ ty years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load capacity to record the heavy @-@ duty traffic two @-@ lane .
the competent regional business cannot say how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated plant @-@ daily traffic will last .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remainder of the remainder of the year until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal waste esp@@ ur , the state enterprise deliberately chose the more moderate amount of time during the school holidays , because it is to be reck@@ oned with with disabilities .
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday by lane on the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school visited the theatre piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Children &apos;s House Wald@@ schule has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s initiated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 students between 11 and 15 years visited the production in the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster through this project .
most young people in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , according to the press release of the Junge Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Lingu@@ kel , and the Junge Theater will collaborate in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , teenagers with and without refugee and migration background should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical distribution are planned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural trip &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope to improve weather
the weather has made the star @-@ escal@@ ator @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern on the south @-@ west of Germany in the night for Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain , to watch the spectacle of the sky , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope lies on the night for Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the Stern@@ schu@@ ppen is Per@@ sei@@ des , which is one of the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us coming up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips to sleep disorders
in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning it is already far from the wake @-@ up ring@@ ing no more to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as non @-@ relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are many causes behind them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eder , member of the board of the German Society of Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ eping Medicine .
what is commonly understood is the In@@ som@@ nia , i.e. a sleeping and sleeping disorder .
especially the sleeping @-@ sleeping experience many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of directors in the German house medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
often sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is particularly common in a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can sleep well , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and starts flas@@ hing about everyday problems and worries , giving we@@ ety an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep distur@@ b the doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor , advise we@@ ety .
the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate the sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , emphasizes the low @-@ standing medical exam@@ in@@ ers in Germany .
for this reason , you should first contact the family doctor if you have problems with your sleeping problems .
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the Schla@@ fl@@ ab@@ or , and what happens ?
for example , in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise , for example , snor@@ ing with respiratory problems , in case of abnormal fatigue , sleep transform@@ ers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , &quot; Fi@@ etze explains .
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not take a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cl@@ apping , one goes to bed at his normal time .
besides the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ ggles , a chest strap and an anten@@ na@@ e on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling draws up the sleeping @-@ end .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of screws which can be used for better sleep .
we@@ ary counts : regular sleeping and standing time , not too long in bed , not sleeping on the day , not watching TV for falling asleep , avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then one begins to reck@@ on immediately , and that is completely and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the disap@@ pointing end of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he first caught gold at the short @-@ track world championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time exhibited his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in the criticism of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king 150@@ ,000 € , nobody should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on his Facebook page on Friday night .
the transport system in swimming sports is bad , however , dop@@ ing controls are very good .
we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the topic dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
that is exactly how it should be kept with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot take a certain amount of time before WM / OS of independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you may not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demands the election Hamburg , who meanwhile runs an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of luggage thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
on Thursday , the prosecution of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage pil@@ es as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants in the area of the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport recognised a gang of bonds that was known to the police from last the@@ fts of theft .
the two women and two men had committed several crimes this year since mid @-@ July and were common , working and especially professional .
the specialists of the Criminal Police officer 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thi@@ eves , who had come to Germany especially to commit criminal off@@ ences .
at the same time , they had exploited more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lime trees , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in seems not at first sight , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walking along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a fres@@ ch@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a beer shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the facade of a grey house someone has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of a Li@@ dl which will soon be demoli@@ shed , it is already being built : a house with tall windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will be favor@@ ed with burning cars over the past few weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , in the meantime the inhabitants have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially Berlin &apos;s internal sen@@ ator handles a harsh action of the police against the project , the area designated as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ mi@@ ths , had been cleared with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ ro@@ logged three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , the building workers were re@@ constructing the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers mar@@ ched under the ju@@ bil@@ ation of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of houses in the sun , others talk about late i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
lef@@ tist force is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who raises three children here , are mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the residents of the house projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who wanted to call for police protection from the v@@ and@@ alizing left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin internal sen@@ ator and the police make between house @-@ occup@@ iers and their neighbors , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class neighborhood , which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty .
house @-@ occup@@ ations and the residential projects born out of it have long been part of the Kie@@ z : in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been deliberately ev@@ acu@@ ated in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world over the past few years . residents of East Germany and former home owners now share their neighborhood with them .
this is also reflected in the rentals , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them on disc@@ arded disks or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which have been disc@@ arded with color bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing force &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason why not all neighbours regard this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as body injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
the most important part of the crimes constitute material damage , which tend to be more likely to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the disputed 94 , there may be no talk of uncertainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbors , they are certainly not .
the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal record , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was consciously moved into the Riga @-@ Straße - and remained .
this is why it was so important for them to get back their streets : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all of them suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the part of the city .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away from them : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is , in the end , con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here are people living not so well &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone never stops ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those drawn from color bombs : the house @-@ projects and the left @-@ hand scene were part of the Kie@@ z .
those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area that can complain badly about noise .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on the spot .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee representative for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and anyone else involved in the project .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the aff@@ lu@@ ent Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , who above all has a problem .
some - less mo@@ cking than on the multitude of demanding tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
an administrative specialist was sought out with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , as well as an aff@@ lu@@ ent Woll@@ mi@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it &apos;s about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as networking activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 per cent substitute for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players .
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are standing in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been a serious problem for some time now to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must teach the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs of the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodation have to be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Office of the Coun@@ cill@@ or to the municipality and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find any private apartments .
it does not work so far , so that one is dependent on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be made accessible , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and employment opportunities for refugees and migrants who have to be und@@ am@@ aged or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do not profit @-@ making work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and volunteers are jumping .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
they must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
whoever gets the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be integrated .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are also problems , says customer honest , &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : are they afraid of ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which some people may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also subject to the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would have the fear that the assass@@ inations bring them completely into retri@@ eval .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; Reg@@ ine says .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region .
they have always been in the background that a new collision may soon come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics ab@@ h@@ ors .
it is actually unfair to put them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy integrating the previous people in a reasonable way .
these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , one must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
