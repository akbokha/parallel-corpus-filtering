<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer visited with some colleagues a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted back home in the fast gallop.</seg>

<seg id="9">And that ended the riding career again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer at all times - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He left with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not catch himself for photo-purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport aid handed over the man from Anhausen in the scope of a small gala, the Golden Sort Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Laurel leaf, Champions Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already adored him.</seg>

<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting young talents for decades.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Pumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidency candidates are unaware of the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep it small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulation." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claims Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will decline regulators massively, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton on the other hand says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has opportunities to open up discrimination and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would increase, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "investing in the need to invest, say Trump and Clinton are almost silent." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly refused by the Republicans of the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, there could still be internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to announce it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly strengthen renewables with its investment program:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazied trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are to be paid better, too, demands Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: one time he says: the minimum wage must rump, then he says he cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop rather to the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens, is about to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics believe that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Frauenhilfe.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterplayer in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed narrowly and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly about his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report a whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as though there was never been anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wrecked.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin told Putin and accused Ankara of being in the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the veto is difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks had to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could win a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he was removed almost from his office last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti put it as follows:" "" "tourists there, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "this is accompanied by persistent resentment on the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is intended to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state gained a bonus in Ankara with certainty that after the attempted coup d'état he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which has even a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an "alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described to me: two countries that are driven away from the West and treated badly and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both presidents said at the press conference that they wouldn't even have touched the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences, while Putin chose to emphasise them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are talking at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin drens Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of the tightest of trust in Putin for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement by the Kremlin, Putin is saying that without giving reasons" "" "the dismissal Ivanovs ordered his duties as President of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been his deputy since 2012, was named his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated at the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website, it is said (in Russian) that he later was chief executive officer and staff leader of the registrar.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said about his appointment to Putin:" "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked for leaving his post and having recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow more mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced, especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once was prized as a potential president to run Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was named his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as a third term of the term would violate Putin's constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, closest ally, Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president again three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensland crossings to the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closings of the" "" "ceiling fans" "", "approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 oblique ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economic Minister Keith Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensland cross country." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witness of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are at their place and the last section of the deck gets a dongation for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented construction and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last street section and its connection with the north tower in the expansion, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the side of the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeter south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very tricky activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6.000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because the tolerances on which the team works were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and the Greens say," "" "Investors are to be taken into duty much more strongly in the future." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD recommends a" "" "living room for action" "" "at the next council session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But strife is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, a regulation is lacking.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "SPD leader Christoph Bratmann says:" "" "we agree with the Greens:" "" "who wants to build on urban areas must in future pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be established in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the big issue in the City Hall is, as Bratmann says:" "" "how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem, so Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants investors to make as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to be even harder for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, as Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market is vanishing.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you reconcile the loss of other around 1300 advantageous apartments, whose promotion will expire in the coming years?</seg>

<seg id="25">This is possible in the Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved at one stroke.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the West Town, deadlines run out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments, one could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children don't go out to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time gazing on screens has been depleted by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS, and once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the U.S., the game led to a considerable increase in steps that put the "average" person back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiac, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, told Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of following people who exercise every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays the Pokémon Go - it merely looks at the raw data for the increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to get" "" "coming from the sofa" "" "and" "" "being active every day" "" "hit deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports are reducing their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokemon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also mumpy game-perches, which always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone might run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity earlier, they didn't give us any reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will diminish over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokémon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is on all this immune.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast rang out on Thursday for the competition title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles turnt turmoil on the floating beam during the single multi-campaign of women in gymnastics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a battle of battle, and the fifth, while consolidating its reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, 15 World Champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-battle array of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark on the farewell ceremony of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during her long journey, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises - which includes her typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a training flight into the gymnasium in which Boorman exercised, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has lost no competition for competition, a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa slightly led through two turns, the image slid.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish bar and ground floor - in which Biles holds the title of the world - lurks.</seg>
<seg id="28">She resumed with 15,433 on the balance beam - and with a 15,933 on the floor, she still sat on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her softly as she expected her grandchild - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collecting book.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her floor exercise she threw Kusshende to the public, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes appeared dubious.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding weet of the 19-year-old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who died in one of Phoenix's deadliest attacks for a decade, while they stopped in the car and heard music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June while the car was parked in a driveway, said the authorities.</seg>

<seg id="5">The police informed that the triple murder did not appear to be the result of a robbery attack because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900, which were owned by one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesperson for Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard stated that the shooting had led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed and two more injured in Hispanic residential neighborhoods within four months.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "it happens in a residential area in front of a house," "" "said Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">It is believed that the suspects used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to their injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah still died on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report about the shooting, aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and that it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's olympiad in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls from other skin colors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian, the catholic is, makes everybody proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner in the last Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple World Championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gyms routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual competition event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but so do trainers in the whole country do not look like this.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to get it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will have only four female gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that Turnen is an expensive sports and gymnastic in private gyms, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, orientation, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables lie in affluent suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to offer many young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to make a more affordable and accessible gymnast.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have founded my gymnastics foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastic in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to take part in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" through the Holes of the Olympic team golds and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £2-per day medication after being advised by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for persons with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="6">The NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffers a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form plaque.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the flooring breaks apart, it can cause a blood clots causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clot loosens, it can flow through the blood stream and clogging the blood flow to the brain which causes a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The NICE draft version, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year on the instigation of a government report on corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to broadening electoral fraud in Muslim communities ignorantly ignored, such as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "the former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles attacks the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of abuse due to" "" "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The former minister of integration and local government, who is now an antagonist king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off belts outside of electoral cabinets in order to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have an identification card to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter must merely name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's finger if they leave their vote to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this not only serves against electoral fraud, but should also protect the local government from the broader corporate culture that is associated with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets's electoral scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor of Luton Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>

<seg id="19">Sir Eric, mapped, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the fogging of evidences to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as proof, pressure has been applied to vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from front or back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you approach you from behind, you should turn yourself first, so that you can see your attacker and move out of the firing line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then hit him with his knee in the bar and twist, while the attacker blends before pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while she directs the gun on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and straighten the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shakes his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveler withdrew his immune system and sausages of a serious test by leaking out some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk took his course on a euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a flushing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before dropping each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will get in.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of leaking the rinsing knob of a tensile toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his bowel by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to railway stations to flushing bones of toilets, the task assigned to his immune system definitely below a rehearsal</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he told:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial screed showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to that, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick up after its luminometer number was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of Dairy products Valio produced the travel film" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "", "which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst thing I've got in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirtier than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't lick anything here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of Dairy Products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valio Senior Vice President of Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at while at the same time explaining the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended that we said" "" "Let's call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" "" "let me tell you - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I've told him to lick up like the disgusting Russian toilet which is shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick it and others where it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from the property, employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had holes, wooden boards were torn, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.</seg>

<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived temporarily in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted was fighting street fights with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, strides and floods.</seg>

<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years long.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house rubbish and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the renters were abused to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family, as a delogization is always the final step to consider Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have boldly approached us and gave us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message conveyed that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="4">After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee immediately condemned a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan functionary told us that the former Sprinter and present coach, John Anzrah, passed a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-metre-runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported by the team leader Kenyan from the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF World Federation asked the IOC to obtain information about the case in order to make their own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, IAAF will make an assessment," "" "he said in an IAAF statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he (Anzrah) went to the Doping control station and expressed himself as Ferguson, the rehearsal and signed," "" "explained Kenyan head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training controls of the world anti-doping agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days before, Kenyan's Athletics Heads of Heads, Michael Rotich, had been deducted from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was said to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Kenya, after numerous doping attempts, Kenya has been under special supervision since a long time.</seg>
<seg id="17">During the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls imposed by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was uncommon that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic commencement.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, the WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is conforming with the rules of the WADA.</seg>

<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of televisions of the ARD, reproaches were raised again and again that doping agents are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sports betrugs.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he hired them in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was possible to prove that in this kind of sport there was a widespread and systematic idea.</seg>
<seg id="26">Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="3">With it, a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leatherard Bernsteins's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director, Cecilia Bartoli, wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classical music and filled with the role of Maria a youth mare.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin-American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers with nostalgia to her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First because it is musically exceptional!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>

<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temper, a fire, a passion and a happy approach to life, which is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" up-to-date: "this piece deals with prejudices and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, back then the Puertorians went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn't want them.</seg>

<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">If the state election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because stupid as up to now it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and farm elections - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers travelling in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so do not choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays there are helpers, inflating posters, inflating balloons, distributing flyers and counting at the end, rubbing only laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to let the people pass over.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains in the end coalitionable remains.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one can see from his major posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>

<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make electoral campaigns at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale documents; Merkel's federal election district is in the north-east.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "the opposite is also commended for those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up residence drives." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of asphalt road in Ofterdingen was lifted, and so the connection to Rottenburg was restored, the traffic situation in the village was relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel on both sides from Ofterdingen from the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">Evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were partly significant complaints," "" "says the deputy head manager Florian King, responsible for the management of the refurbishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because there were many routes seeking and more familiar to their navigation device than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">The result was that some trucks were franking in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not met, the congregation joined the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "there were considerable transgressions," "" "says King, who himself made himself competent on the spot." ""</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the street is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27-refurbishment has led to revenue fractures can be seen through each one you ask.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "who has less to do with the" "" "end customer" "", "so for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Also at the dealership Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a "maximum slight drop," but also admits that, of course, "the runway is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The bars are most popular along the street.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly known as Crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only did it, but all the restaurants" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "the road marking has thrown back its operation" "" "two years back." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his employees have to be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, District President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner if there could be financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant benefit otherwise from the advantages of the location at the B 27. now she must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">At all complaints Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715. it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He is able to understand that other regular guests are less frequent now because of the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go down, it is also somewhere else nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">After the restoration work, Göhner has no doubt that his pedicures return to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long history.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "these will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "the CDU man admits." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">He still considers this reasonable and also does not demand anything that the coalition partner has no chance anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented by de Maizière as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">They sometimes have it in themselves: he plans rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detaining people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted at the country are supposed to check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a safety check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of Duldivorces for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away in order to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of it is politically and legally heigth.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them are still unexploited and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the imtreatment of tolerated, for example - the question arises: what has this to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the killers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people deeply dealt with could not be clinging to election times.</seg>

<seg id="34">And yes, there are election campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security.</seg>

<seg id="37">Only a garsty dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then a security policy idea collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the departments also demand a Burka ban and a renunciation of dual citizenship.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment section to see him under the pseudonym of non-Allea men's middle aged with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the reemergence of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to misty midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horde through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers prefer their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending their own time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit, and wildly stuffed before I stop, hold my hands and say something special: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which independent vendors resided - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, that I of Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle aged men) into the Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men middle aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already treasure," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 slabs.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records pictured above (he sent me the snapshot via e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford than appeared and again bought items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early seventies, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was a bit too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend some time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers that he meets are applying to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have conducted, people usually have been discharged so as to get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to trailers of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a store such as Phonica to realize that record shops offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to the WEZ, some of the older customers received an impetus to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that evoke happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or possessing material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector, and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is an easy way to mentally focus.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a member of staff flutes from a stack of plates." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month had not listened to them yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned as I smoother through a stack of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle aged men) has noticed a "trophic aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here just recently and said:" I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-intensive, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly get in.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a blower audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer and sexpacked pop instead of experimental jazz reconciles from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strangely lonely, but traumatic traumas are difficult to detain when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a window-shop than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives away with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression to brave the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "record art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers could send into the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that sells most for luxury objects such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research revealed that the results of YouGov agree, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record stores and online forums, are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not having strolling through the record shops of Berwick Street and the sheets by plates while they avoid the startling look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who raises nothing suspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to submit 72 temporary stores in which people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energydrinks, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and which are a fire and disaster risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Lille court decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people who" "" "live in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas are quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids "Café of the camp, which is charitable and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers need to adapt to the next generation of speed meters: in different federal states, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flashes are being tested, which are to be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on highway construction sites or to rehabilitated bridges with temporary speed policing there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary flash for compliance with speed limits.</seg>
<seg id="5">A permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with uninterrupted measurement operation; the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limiters and driving bans at time, driving stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a state-of-the-art movement, the trailer can be moved with each car with trailer coupling.</seg>
<seg id="10">So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels in the armored and incidentally also sweat-proof outer shell disappear.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the lightning from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic in various federal states and is now also used.</seg>
<seg id="13">Foreign authorities also flash with the new technology: recently, France has ordered 100 copies, after an order of 150 pieces last year.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-7 rugby was an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio with a result of 43-7.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in handling, side steppe, back, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The defeat of the ks, 7-5 in the semi-finals the same day, could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for UK - but probably it will not be - that at least one Brite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England in Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to wonder and let the attacks jump off GBs for fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if they were running in running buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau frosted in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A squirrel of Mitchell stopped the mountain from Mann Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but Fiji only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua reached a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the re-opening and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vbreatho Ravouvou squeezed through further weak Tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB conducted fundamental changes at half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt at GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of South Osseeinsulans, whose fans sang, flags wave and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliname put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked annihilated in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the past, Fiji Japan defeated in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with impressive footwork and scored a goal under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside team, assured the winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the trainer's cancer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinous gold than in these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only the two who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams was there when they rowed to the second Olympiagold in succession without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport, which made such a yardstick.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, after all, her 39.ter idle bet, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of wild helpers who make the difference and no one was more powerful than the trainer who did not know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a very bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right concept under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so it had to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it remains with the release from the Renewable Energy Transition in the components of the so-called self-power production in the German steel industry," "" "said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" "" "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" "" "(WAZ, Friday edition)."

<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>

<seg id="18">Last year, the situation was further exacerbated when the world's largest producer country China threw steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are throwing price dumping Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties show effect on import steel, on the other hand the economic prospects in China were brightened up.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp already her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the Lehramt studies she finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says of the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">By regular gatherings, seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures in old age dissolve, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, seniors are training deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs are not so quickly out of the puff in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Singing is an optimal hobby when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at age.</seg>
<seg id="15">Singing is often a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisationen.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, joint singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Liedtexte and especially the melodies often entangle dementia sufferers for long-term events.</seg>
<seg id="19">Singing will also require a special performance to the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone do not only focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise something for a long time, I become better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there's enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound comes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Anyone who wishes to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choir members can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you don't have access to the Internet, your family, friends or neighbors can ask for help from Internet searches.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is doing good for the soul and has something liberating - that is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="6">In this respect, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hua Hin, located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok, initially exploded two bombs on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, among them the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two explosives went up again, and another man was killed, according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the seaside resort Patong who was popular with tourists.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country another bomb exploded, killing a municipal employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed before the territory of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang called for several injured on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-eastern coast.</seg>

<seg id="18">It is too early to express itself about possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist insurgency or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Instead, one assumes that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities have kept secret notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days, but they were not informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">The group behind the attacks is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police told her officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but mostly they do not judge tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin there is a palace that was used over the years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommending its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elaborated by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to bring chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement of economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, will benefit themselves to restore the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the insurgency of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hindu Shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>

<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweighted swimmers from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks Habte became the viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old completed his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly athletic figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special status from the International Swimming Federation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to promote swimming in underrepresented countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since most athletes are running in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something else.</seg>

<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney the run of Eric Moussambani ensured media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmers from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone over 100 meters of free style.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was fired at the time.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fee per cubic meter of sewage is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste water plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welshahl 3.44 instead of so far 2,10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 Euro (up to now 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euro (up to now 2,18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the facility in Azendorf, the waste water charge will increase again later if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a higher rate of calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the household by the District Office Kulmbach found that for these sewage plants subfloor coverings are running.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is committed to operating the facilities in a cost-effective manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welchenahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">Revenue increases between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed the committee, a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period between October 2016 and September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period can also be equaled.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained that there are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water waste, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenditures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the wastewater volume in all three systems is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, in the past calculation period, renovation and repair costs were significantly affected by all three systems due to their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for the world market, Neudorf and Reuth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt noted that the mechanical ventilation system in the wastewater facility Azendorf had to be replaced due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welchenahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and the first sewage pond had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses included the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water waste in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were "fully smashed."</seg>
<seg id="20">Schmidt, the market community of great entertainment costs in the waste water plants in the past 20 years, has been spared.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the above-mentioned plants will continue to remain precarious in the long run, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater association could not be expanded, because it is a deficit facility.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as an Asian cartoon</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunt, self-winding tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All false appearances come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past when they were accused of promoting Blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them slighty eyes, false teeth and darkened cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies showed a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have turned off the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was meant as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who experienced racism reminded the filter of offending clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos were widely distributed that the filter was "hurting and mildly said."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "she added that" "" "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very reluctant Asiatic caricature and the filter effects." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-proof, but that the yellowing face has been pulled into the deflected extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could tend to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult that such items remain unnoticed when it was the case earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as Product Manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on media and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leaders and finished their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," "" "said the Chinesich-American Zhu," "" "or they have people with other skin colours that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsified ISIS intelligence, rejects Committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel from the United States Central Command have changed intelligence to record an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as the actual conditions on the ground allowed, an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The draft report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Members of the Committee Committee, Secret Service Committees and the Military Commissariat, reports of great discontent among Central Command Intelligence Agencies who reported how superiors changed their appreciation to US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "intelligence, which is typically scaled by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly marked a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," "" "said a newspaper article to the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The guide errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than facts," "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, it's so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to record the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports from the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of Centcom's reports is underway by the Chief Inspector of the Defense Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services," said the Highest Demokrat in Comrade tea, a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, so Mr. Schiff," delayed the release of intelligence reports, "" "" said the moral of analysts and "" "" gave excessively enough room for dissenting opinions. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there was no evidence of a White House intervention in the Centcom analysts with regard to" "" "certain political opinions" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspector who was included in the complaint of Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, issued a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress, while the General Inspector's investigations were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have quite diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that has meanwhile been made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the question as far as President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of intermediaries of more than ten years ago, when Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, saw a written document on how the then government under George W. Bush saw only a small occupation force in Iraq, and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year the team headed by Mr. Hooker states that contrary to the statements of the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his overly positive assessment of the situation during a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after she had shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro events feel constant and inevitable, a rapid relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod that is handed down from the crossbow archers to a gymnastic for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Leverky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a black swarm with dimples, could certainly have been among those known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnast or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting gold in Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partially in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make a modest argument for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although jumping on the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it became so sparse for the last 16 years that many people, I had questioned, did not know that it is actually an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in the trampolines and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has a certain outsider character, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschule as the one that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a earthbound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has a humorous potential - the cartoonish tremor of his never to end pop-up - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite them.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before landing on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official Olympic program, they are assessed according to the execution, degree of difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes down and down, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also another high goal in television transmission: that of the world or the Olympiarekords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel when looking at these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualification and encirclement will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final laps as part of an afternoon block at both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the anthropoids and objectivity of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turner recently proposed according to the The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to come to air.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that tens of thousands of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at gunshots.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia pulling together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the response of the government was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos currently circulating on the protests, probably from the last or early this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was constrained, while dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest it breaks off," "" "said Seyoum Tesmobil, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden have been forced to exploit the turbulence over the past few years and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness still explode under the surface after years of intolerance.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media since cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they were so protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amperas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, prospered mainly in Christian Highlands, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under one umbrella," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many of Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special commissioners to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after protesting thousands of votes that were seemingly obscured by the government and subsequently stolen by the analysts.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in the last months and this period of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it adopts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amish city, run by Tigray conduct business and hate the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests spread the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights on the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While Westerners want to support democracy clearly, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by anging that his repeatedly repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would have been the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligibly to the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his comrades who strive to protect him during an eventful phase in order to explain the peculiar position of which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump returned to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to interpret, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism rattles to Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">When talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech bored.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he received strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Clinton's e-mails, but later he explained, "Of course I said that sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone linguistic boundaries in politics and then back up as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more corrosive tone as his survey values have continued." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a tour with a large margin in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general tries to unapologize for his provocative pronouncements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocatively his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advocates of Trump, gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "said Mr. Giuliani to the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements questioning whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>

<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread out by taking control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and being taken against him.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a bigamy café in Williamsburg, in which you could only pay cash that didn't have Wi-Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue store front.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie business, replacing the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Native people used it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>

<seg id="7">But if New York is a change, then it's also new discovery.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime associate of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He began to work at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandshark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönlandhaie usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie will only get offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark floats along the North Atlantic coast, in an hour it comes on average just 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters is the five-meter-long animal accelerates to satte 2,6 km / h - and with this top speed half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle marked by slowness seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" in any case from a Greenland shark, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "says Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max-Planck-Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life-span, which means vertebrates a world record." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist probably assumed that Greenland was stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-haie is hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice-sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland shark.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow motion sensed them when they buried six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks nevertheless make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for cadavers that torment from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Grönlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimetres measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when atomic weapons search for larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 220 centimeters length of the third-minute animal, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons tests, it should have celebrated its 50th anniversary in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all the larger Greenland shark-sharks had normal carbon-14 amounts in its lens nucleus, which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimetre long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres would be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign the length an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably at the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-haie with the increase obviously leaves at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methane alemes live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old harpoon tip was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus flames.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The loss of heat from one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than in one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible," "" "explains Scheuerlein the evolutionary biologist." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest more in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots has unleashed a media insurrection after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed an Israeli code since it claimed Arab guests according to an employee. "</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel at the hotel's list of countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">The country, however, was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.</seg>

<seg id="7">Wrote Lanzmann.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the exchange rate between Moscow and Teheran grew by 70.9 percent in the year-on-year comparison.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran, interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly, the ambassador said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyocal Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were dealt with together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the ministries in the next two years, the ministries around St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a several-day pilgrim hike.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were tested and finally decided for the Bishop's city of Freiburg, where in this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the open gate of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the holy chambers, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Fr. Stork sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims' crosses and distributed the pilgrim's blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Muenster Our Lady stands and so the Pilgrim's Way from the Muenster was taken.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis on field-crosses, chapels or churches repeatedely set up Rast to sing a song from a specially compiled pilgrim's booklet.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the overnights, the parish homes of the local parishes were at their disposal.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage were Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller for a tasty and starchy dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the end of the day, we went to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting route, but had to climb some 500 meters in the heat of the heat and then climb again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bathroom weiher in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning pulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing convent church of St. Peter, we went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy the Minis met in the late afternoon at Freiburger Münster, passing through the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse, God thanked God.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the city metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raged last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchorage that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made his own.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking a modest sixth place at the London train world championships despite the arrival of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the hitchhiker Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as a Hinder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired gave a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who prevailed four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner prevailed in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, Hinder was close behind, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that Hinder drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set up an Olympiarord in the final round and the world champions are defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell onto the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said:" "" "it feels like the whole UK flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle current.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny it is in the range of possibility that he repeated Hoys win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who also was born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were more good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Brachman Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on security.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought with officers before the qualification yesterday, when functionaries called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Korsoon of Milngavie in World Record Time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong train cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There were drama in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of sex and mobbing reproaches, as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium meltdown from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers "workplaces - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus will lift all supply contracts as the supplying energy company shared.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year to not give any further subsidies to the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 workstations in the area of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2,000 workstations - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa concluded the point Henry melt, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the long-standing speculation on the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, supplying the large aluminium smeltery with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland will continue to operate, which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt," said the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to say that the Treaties were called" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which should have been in force from November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore AGL assumes that the contracts in fiscal 17 will contribute to revenues," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL income from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong futures prices for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual statement amounting to $187 million in" "" "anticipation of termination" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to expire the contracts, the" "" "ability of Alcoas... to run the melt, or to ensure the power supply to the melt" "", "does not interfere." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the sought-after September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "wrote Kendall." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the cardashians similar?), vicious reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular Showbiz Oncology and Producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), which ends with a classical turn: they all have planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the cliché-like act of almost every birthday cake of a children's show (Seacrest gave the sentence "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon girl on a broadcasting station at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Cardashians has begun with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim might have beaten her, regarding the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that is more similar to an illustrated book than a fashion journal, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According Fashionista were 615 pages of advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leaked before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years there were clearly more "celebrities that modeled" than "models, the celebrities are" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners does not like success to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jenners has always been a bit tense in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mistletoe of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were again boiling up when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But there seems to be a point of passing along the grim.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is supermodel in the true sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your priming of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her free time she is seen in Reality TV. probably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children.</seg>

<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block displays on its desktop side, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop side would change the coding on its advertisements in order to make it difficult for indicating the recognition of which part of the advertising site is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that there was a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her battle between the upcoming open source community and the bypads has already been underway since the invention of ad lockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered into the struggle is a strong indication of how worrying banners have become the industry.</seg>

<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay down in the dark, "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss woman wanted to kill himself at the age of 49, that of several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police told them, as well as any witnesses of the incident to report themselves.</seg>

<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>

<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not held accountable.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabited.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies NASA have developed a model to explore the past of Venus by means of tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if the Venus could have rebuffed similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly rotated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus exhibits its day-through-side of the sun for almost two months," "" "stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution, previously thought by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus -- in the course of several billion years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans darkened and their water vapor was fired away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect back -- the Venus that we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers understand why stars rotate at different rates and in which connection the rotational periods are associated with the formation of planets.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympic 2016: chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping occurrences.</seg>
<seg id="4">A trained athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre barrier runner Silvia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically acclaimed athletics competitions, these messages come to the untimely.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been proven, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Court of Justice CAS confirmed their expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old took fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, just 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen should have participated in the courses of over 50 m free style.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-sample and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very serious and requires a full cooperation in the investigations," "" "quoted Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also during the night of Rio, the news of the positive trial in Danekova was leaking, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she was innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "stated the athletic." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the blood doping agent EPO is supposed to act in the forbidden substance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Daniova has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-sample should have already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov returned promptly with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why athletes don't pull the proper conclusions," he said: "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For instance, all weight lifters from the chronically doped nation should not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "on Friday the case" "" "Adrian Zielinski" "", "the London Olympic champion in the class to 85 kg, was tested on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days before." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Both may start ingesting, but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes, Danekova's fall is another severe blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Federation IAAF has banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic doping, even the runner-up nation of Kenya produces many bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming-sport, the former breaches in China also ensured violent clashes between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harsch.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkels lilac."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the Podium for 200 m Freestyle, I want to pass over," "" "said Lacourt in the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun stood at the heart of a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping fraud," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was positively tested in the Chinese championships in 2014 for the stimulant Trimetazidin, but had to be locked only a three month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data Loss: so perfide blackjack hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware infection specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed in the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes several victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40% of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observation of Malwarebytes to attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to redeem the ransom is considerably higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a frightening fast evolution of malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes head Marcin Kleczynski talking to the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then discovered the perpetrators of blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was terrifying quickly in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim actively, it seeks to systematically search for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the requirements of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final cryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies affected sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop business operations completely, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several hospitals have already been victims of attacks in Germany, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "don't pay, you only promote the problem," "" "says Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of stalemate in operation." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the investigators of F-Secure have investigated the use areas and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They account to their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, direct access to freely accessible support sites, or decode for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must in part negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to retrieve their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, hackers become more professional and share their work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus company Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is about three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware then in the form of a software module to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The so-called Malware-Kits were created by the malware itself, counseling and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is a fitting tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you are logged in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals then commission spammers with dissemination," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey are confident that Ransomware can handle backup-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful completion, the perpetrators are threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," "" "explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the potential damage potential is much higher, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrator could take completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz, Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the offenders then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="4">It sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it does not work closely at any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well-finished and pleasant, only the cockpit of the cockpit is a little bit off.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the backrest can be folded up like a seat chair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the ground up to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to make his work a little quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another motorization: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering seems to be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment of the tested top version" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The security systems include the City emergency brake assist (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warner sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the smart speed controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if required.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is available only for the top features: 7-inch touch screen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI-socket lie underneath the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel engines are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will get the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning it is already far from the wake-up ringing no more to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as non-relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are many causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeder, member of the board of the German Society of Sleeping and Sleeping Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What is commonly understood is the Insomnia, i.e. a sleeping and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially the sleeping-sleeping experience many people as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of directors in the German house medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Often sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is particularly common in a depression," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can sleep well, wakes up every two to three hours and starts flashing about everyday problems and worries, giving weety an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disturb the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor, advise weety.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin, emphasizes the low-standing medical examiners in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, you should first contact the family doctor if you have problems with your sleeping problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the Schlaflabor, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, snoring with respiratory problems, in case of abnormal fatigue, sleep transformers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, "Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not take a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After clapping, one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and an antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling draws up the sleeping-end.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws which can be used for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weary counts: regular sleeping and standing time, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not watching TV for falling asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then one begins to reckon immediately, and that is completely and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="4">Now the former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler has placed himself in the criticism of his ex-team-mates via Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 €bonus and a jungle king 150,000 €, nobody should be surprised about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old on his Facebook page on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="6">The transport system in swimming sports is bad, however, doping controls are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">We cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the topic doping or even operate it.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "I don't say that the controls should be set here," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">That is exactly how it should be kept with countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "if you cannot take a certain amount of time before WM / OS of independent controllers of WADA / FINA, you may not participate," "" "demands the election Hamburg, who meanwhile runs an ice cream." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, the prosecution of two women and two men aged 50 to 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several handkerchiefs and baggage piles as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30, civil servants in the area of the Dusseldorf Airport recognised a gang of bonds that was known to the police from last thefts of theft.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several crimes this year since mid-July and were common, working and especially professional.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the Criminal Police officer 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thieves, who had come to Germany especially to commit criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the same time, they had exploited more than 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between still another cobblestone pavement: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain seems not at first sight, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walking along the road from east to west, one passes playgrounds, a fresched kindergarten and a beer shop.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "on the facade of a grey house someone has" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of a Lidl which will soon be demolished, it is already being built: a house with tall windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be favored with burning cars over the past few weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, in the meantime the inhabitants have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially Berlin's internal senator handles a harsh action of the police against the project, the area designated as "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the cadmiths, had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police patrologged three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the building workers were reconstructing the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers marched under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of houses in the sun, others talk about late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist force is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who raises three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "it doesn't sound like a" "" "Kiez" "", "who wanted to call for police protection from the vandalizing left." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin internal senator and the police make between house-occupiers and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class neighborhood, which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">House-occupations and the residential projects born out of it have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been deliberately evacuated in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world over the past few years. residents of East Germany and former home owners now share their neighborhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rentals, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them on discarded disks or freshly painted facades, which have been discarded with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often with the words" "" "left-wing force" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbours regard this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes such as body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most important part of the crimes constitute material damage, which tend to be more likely to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the disputed 94, there may be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbors, they are certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal record, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was consciously moved into the Riga-Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important for them to get back their streets: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all of them suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the part of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless newbuildings in former buildings that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "this is, in the end, condominiums that are not interesting for many - here are people living not so well" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those drawn from color bombs: the house-projects and the left-hand scene were part of the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area that can complain badly about noise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee representative for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and anyone else involved in the project.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine's customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the affluent Wollmilchsau, who above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some - less mocking than on the multitude of demanding tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">An administrative specialist was sought out with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, as well as an affluent Wollmichsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it's about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as networking activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 per cent substitute for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine's customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are standing in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "it has been a serious problem for some time now to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must teach the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation have to be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Office of the Councillor to the municipality and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find any private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work so far, so that one is dependent on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be made accessible, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training centres, school grounds, one-euro jobs and employment opportunities for refugees and migrants who have to be undamaged or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do not profit-making work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever gets the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are also problems, says customer honest, "people with whom nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: are they afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine customer says quite clearly," "" "which some people may call naive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also subject to the refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassinations bring them completely into retrieval.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," Regine says.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that a new collision may soon come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics abhors.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is actually unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy integrating the previous people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, one must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
