Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
the meeting should also involve the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement building and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal promoted by Obama , the Iranian nuclear program has deterior@@ ated the relationship between the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech that was partly considered to be an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election in Israel with reference to the election .
in an emergency call professor tries to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told us with a somewhat sha@@ ky voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officers found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ written note , which was scrat@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was written according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police , he shot and killed a popular professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ sh@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff members have heard shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police arrested him .
one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal acts .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he was also a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy mean that the doc@@ torate that Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee of an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs track later when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he holds a doc@@ torate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs called him intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , Lamb said &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn , O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but because of his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both at a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together some gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5th September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica playing in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were sitting up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Fr . Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
around 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Memorial Day , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that Lamb is now saying that Lamb opened the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt and that Lamb had called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts and it seems to me that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and an arm &apos;s length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unden@@ i@@ ably the biggest travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be released on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN CEO says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN CEO once again calls on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive talks aimed at finding a political solution .
ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of the Meeting of Ministers of the General Assembly this month in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ separ@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of whom none of them also won a state in the Nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs and Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now realizing SR@@ s &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and starting to drop their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ umps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are rot@@ ated by 180 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures stand in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa stated last week that 60 per cent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates approximately the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favour@@ ites of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ cans sees d@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , according to ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not fit into the White House , thus ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their guide hats , republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is apparent that a large number of GO@@ P voters see the campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump still beats almost everybody .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to s@@ ling@@ backs while Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he got 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb George 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have won their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump , in his election campaign two months ago , called immig@@ rant from Mexico &quot; ra@@ pes , &quot; the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse was in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic way of expressing Tr@@ ump &apos;s decisive His@@ panic American will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey dated Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump regarding immigration issues .
so long as immigration in the spotlight remains , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently does .
the fru@@ stration over the government has climbed to new high@@ s .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all due to their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington too .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago showed that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans were frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; degra@@ ded . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive con@@ domini@@ um - with a view over the North Sea position .
in the street , a square metre of a street roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the supply of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows which special locations cost one square meter the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential resorts , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , well marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double go@@ al@@ keeper in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to FC Bayern 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have launched a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympic ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and i@@ dol ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
in his 28 matches in the Champions League for Bavaria , Müller was rewarded with the assistance of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who had a f@@ lange @-@ thought shot of the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bavarian captain Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held a word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated image without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus has won his recent six home games in the top class , including known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund joined in 2011 ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too imagin@@ atively with their offensive efforts .
the attacks were initiated too often via game shift on Link@@ Sau@@ ces Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner of the cake .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee par@@ ked ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set needle @-@ stit@@ ches .
but on goal keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ ance .
so for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of Ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a four @-@ dimensional chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , initially sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero was given the green light only after finishing the final training , said sports board Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to do something different from it , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , mil@@ dly Müller placed another bet .
in front of the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern @-@ fans in their audience block apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with bat@@ ons against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
anyone who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke not only harm the lung , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : when doing so , the risk decreases rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers have the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , higher up to 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 % .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
tooth decay causes cavi@@ ties and inflamm@@ ations of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the link between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to frequent fl@@ esh@@ y inflamm@@ ations in smokers .
it is not clear whether smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment fell to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people have to convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said head of study H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and blood vessels and , according to our knowledge , also leads to good dental health right up to the high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population is affected by lack of tooth@@ lessness in the age of 65 to 74 , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists visit Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer on remains from late Anti@@ quity
archaeological finds were made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the construction site for the new Rhine @-@ bou@@ lev@@ ard arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings excav@@ ated , Museum Director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday .
since the start of construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
during all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department of archaeological soil conservation .
in the third section of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists have now become rich .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , Trier explained .
beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman caught in freight train
after a young woman arrived at the train station in the Gei@@ sel@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ den train station , the German police asks the population for help .
on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock the woman came out towards the station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .

she was treated on the spot by emergency doctor and brought to a hospital by rescue forces .
on the basis of the noc@@ turn@@ al crossing of the young woman there is no evidence of the intermedi@@ ary function@@ aries .
the incident was probably observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by by Lin@@ der@@ ner Rail , Ziegel@@ bä@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question .

EU Commission propos@@ ing new court in dispute over TTIP
in order to clear the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
accordingly , the controversial private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between companies and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system which , in its functioning , corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that the citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European bar@@ gaining position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
the largest free trade zone in the world will be created by TTIP with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceeding demonstrate in detail that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time a second instance is provided .
it would allow it to appeal against judgment .
so far , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbit@@ rators , but there was no possibility of objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work on an international investment court .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , which has been demanded above all by major corporations , is considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , over which companies can enforce liability for tax@@ pa@@ yers , lev@@ y national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was particularly critic@@ ised that they should not be considered for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German econom@@ ist Matthias Mach@@ ining ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
the Commission considered fundamental points in the reform that German Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU ministers in spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European corporate association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economy &apos;s pi@@ anos by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered un@@ sustainable .
delicate folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost ap@@ preh@@ ended by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about different places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they arose and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative person .
with the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; released in 2003 , clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be very close to American folk in the late 1960s , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent drift at any time .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ eded series : each of the 50 states of the US should be sung in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and close to the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and breaks positively certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens appears here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a comprehensive masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
overl@@ apping of ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any yearly list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic sub@@ stitutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth full studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ b .
from the smaller clubs , the stage shows become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark district of Hamburg more !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he primarily presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the more mature St@@ ev@@ ens turns back to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays themselves through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience one hears : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and one can thus throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record basically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens says modest , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and eventually bowed to thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the fra@@ ming of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been anticipated with suspen@@ se at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ me@@ works since his election
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will be making his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ me@@ works and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will raise himself in order to make the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip several sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several titles in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a speaker by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in respect of silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader .
the British correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; stac@@ king &quot; within the Labour Party , namely Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour would make changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow @-@ Labour and R@@ ent Minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the 26@@ ,000 £ to £ 23.@@ 000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron &apos;s ever since he is T@@ ory Chief , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who promised another policy approach says he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ative and that he will refrain from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kno@@ ck@@ iness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and stri@@ fe with hooks and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Bud@@ get@@ ary Minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought up the idea that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of Com@@ mons , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy theatre &quot; that is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was seen with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms .

Po@@ und increases by accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound ster@@ ling according to data showing an increase in the UK wage growth . parallel to this , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target of SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , the result of no bonuses in the UK increased by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and most er@@ ased estimates of the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % vis @-@ à @-@ vis the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 compared to the euro .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer of Riv@@ alen AB In@@ Be@@ v .

after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Glen@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said that it took 2.5 billion $ through a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares in the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s made his assessment for the company R@@ ating on sale .
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sport reporting company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million in the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could affect the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

Pe@@ gi@@ da poster Br@@ its Lebanese on a Pot@@ ato Ide@@ a
potato or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - namely in the potato @-@ d@@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ denburg snack owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the phrase &quot; potato instead of pat@@ rons &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster during a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he accidentally saw on television .
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes , has been spinning in its shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has to be registered in the patent office in Munich in the meantime .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to tell how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just as much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding is also good for its customers .
Met@@ a starts a campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - invasion
Met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branches from an al@@ di @-@ parade in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ a launched a campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ alli@@ c and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing over social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on@@ board , with brands like ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell che@@ ap@@ ly tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ alli@@ c will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when wholes@@ al@@ ers for food , alcohol and appliances will carry out its annual investment strategy ag .
it is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take around five percent of the food market in these two countries after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retailers may lose 360 $ million per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that in the next year , Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ a loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that Met@@ a would probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ a would disappear .
Met@@ a declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ a contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ GA@@ S market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Retail , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt when printing sales and margins at the same time .
however , wholes@@ al@@ ers refuse and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equ@@ alize sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week and to provide I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by fast growing fresh food and providing a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and relo@@ cation programmes to El@@ an are to be adjusted and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism of his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and ear@@ ns praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behavior according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Duel@@ ist , who is repeatedly called Special K@@ s , came into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s in@@ famous confrontation with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati shortly afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison saying , &quot; Wa@@ y@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have hit Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a Kra@@ mp@@ f sh@@ ook a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended from He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that I am quite jeal@@ ous about is the fact that after my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the conflict a little , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player to break a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z on the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick has quickly made the climb to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he goes into the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his action .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency situation , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary explains the state of emergency and governed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants responded in a man &apos;s land and re@@ acted with ou@@ trage .
the people who had fled from violence were stuck in a strip of land between the two control points of the countries for an unknown time and built up tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the Mig@@ rants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the B@@ order ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would return while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc at a con@@ ten@@ tious meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the dec@@ las@@ si@@ fied Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that , finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement was reached that the EU states would record another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the crisis of immigration on the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency situation on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having stopped a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and become an entry point into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the off@@ ence of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high fence constructed by the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the military deployment of the military that is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had already wi@@ ped 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come here by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ setting off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wag@@ gon arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and pressed a crowd to push themselves into it .
around 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would deny food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in National Survey
the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced that he is running for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say their opinion is what candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support for the men has decreased significantly , and S@@ anders is only 5 points behind .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters less than 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
Clinton , however , has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with double @-@ digit advance in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries state that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who don &apos;t support Clinton at the moment - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
while 48 percent of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters speak this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman to be president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the vot@@ ability are also cited .
as the Vice President casts a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked , who is their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
of Clinton &apos;s followers , more than half say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den , not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage rises ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ f@@ most &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call questions on the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these election voters is unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some key features among voters of the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities Main@@ tain Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as Secretary of State , most demo@@ cra@@ cies in the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half the Americans are unhappy with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , shortly after the problem came to light , public opinion was split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that her opinion had worsen@@ ed her opinion .
it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views became worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of those entitled to vote do not consider them to be an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of voting rights nationwide also see tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good scores for leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush rightly cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders to be honest , but like Car@@ son many don &apos;t think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
on the two candidates , half of the voters &apos; support is missing in the new survey , and others lose dramatically
republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers throughout the country . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month to 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son walks well among demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is down@@ cast with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell most deeply , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % in third place .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week shows that Car@@ son goes up in the poll@@ s - he ends with 19 % support among the Republi@@ cans , behind the dump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to questioning faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for ba@@ thers to find warm water .
a bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go into the sea anymore : the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a mysterious ritual of a student compound in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood called Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually compla@@ ined of headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ sh@@ eff Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ ig@@ h with a bl@@ unt force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ment of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ es family in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment due to murder of the third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of terrorist attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold it accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national fr@@ at@@ ernity op@@ poses its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increase in interest comes , and the house@@ se is stag@@ gering , returns for loans will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of economics provides little guidance on the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so sharply that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that the whole fuss could possibly be exagger@@ ated due to an increase in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at too low levels to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for net income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study to what happened after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is mostly up@@ trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to an up @-@ to @-@ date analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant Strate@@ gic at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published in Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ den@@ zi@@ ally occur later in the increase cycle and the rate of return thus begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions which it did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , only twice the nominal GDP has been below 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few anticipate that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rises in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants made a net interest increase all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all levels of inflation from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and put on pre @-@ rec@@ essions very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the fixed income was also volatile as the market anticip@@ ates interest increase , and the pattern is quite similar to that on the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is quicker than for stocks when they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a de@@ fl@@ ation of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often result in better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is flat , credit lines have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened their strategy .
in large and large companies that handle the larger portion of their business operations in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multination@@ als with high debts are getting worse since an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their lower quality counter@@ parts by 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high percentage of flexible interest rates will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside the pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
savers could see profits through higher income , even if experts of differing opinions are how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives member of Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this is not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; says a leader in parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ law radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which launched last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples where you just im@@ itate what &apos;s already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham states .
BBC Managing Director rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far off his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anywhere else about classical music .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works , I really think it &apos;s important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it was harder to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that was under fire during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for it , to tread the commercial ri@@ vals to the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced &quot; in a special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time there was a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at slower pace and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the record starts in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday has slow@@ ed down issues in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
yet experts say there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase over the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the Guardian &apos;s IM@@ R@@ G sales journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ utes , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for declining sales .
experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers focused on their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites r@@ ushed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which buyers strug@@ gled for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spending was spent a little more than £ 1 online .
for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in downtown cities .
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca during crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral par@@ c@@ els in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part to the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning filled , mostly dressed in white , the way to pay their respect , when the first of the dead began their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance grav@@ ey@@ ard .
the funeral procession passed by the holy place , where only days before a building ran through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell onto the worshi@@ ppers .
the bodies were released for burial , when the Saudi king imposed a san@@ ction on the construction company bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the disaster that also left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 worshi@@ ppers who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Zone of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual h@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already stated firmly that the H@@ add@@ an will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the bin Laden Group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad were prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which r@@ ushed into a courtyard of the grand mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the h@@ add@@ ling , which will be held later this month .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the Kran@@ s , and its representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounded Mek@@ ka &apos;s mega @-@ mos@@ que as part of the massive building project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
for decades , Ben Laden &apos;s family has been connected to the royal family of Saudi Arabia and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was an ab@@ u@@ sive son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the collapse of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay hospit@@ alized .
government officials stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded .
other wounded will receive half of this amount .

the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has risen sharply
this leads to the opening of 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops targeting professional tra@@ des@@ people .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q stores nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out work in their home
if you can deal skill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you apparently belong to a minority today .
the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , which has offered services at deep prices , has meanwhile out@@ dated .
therefore King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is still a majority of men in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must shift this more strongly to a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing shops .
because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , who has Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball team A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ev@@ asion .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he was legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to Chief At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the investigation became clear that the defend@@ ants were used for private purposes in 2006 @-@ 2011 .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also charged with financial results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact retired from the president of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to blame for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that at no point was an asset made of an asset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sports officials only charged expense allowance and the Sport@@ club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money from debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( roughly 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we faced the situation : do we continue or block the club ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the accused , the chief char@@ tered accoun@@ tant of the financial department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , our life insurance under@@ goes as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , no debt can be made .
furthermore , with appropriate financial results , the compensation of the expense allowance had been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid out only years later , namely from 2003 , when an asset had been on the account .
this is why Pau@@ schal@@ k and not detailed booking also appeared , the former ob@@ servant explained the events .
the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ us shared the two accused together , the second defend@@ ant said .
the judge asked why the payments were not disclosed in detail to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not interest in detail for the financial regulation , it is important only to have the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , when a function@@ ary inquiry began due to official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were provisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the accused . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know any answer for a long time .
then he finally thought he had believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensation claim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why claim compensation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all out of the tailor with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he only charged mile@@ age and di@@ eting .
on diets , he charged the association 1000 Euro per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were unable to demonstrate exact documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an operating audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also referred to o@@ dom@@ eter .
all de@@ port@@ ations were made in cash , for that he had to drive from his place of residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on September 23 with the survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard st@@ acks further 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff reduction that has been running for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ esis will be disman@@ tled when the company is split@@ ting up further jobs .
the positions of the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ esen H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce its breakdown from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division .
as a result , costs of 2.@@ 7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special burden of around EUR 2.7 billion , which will be affected by the fourth quarter .
the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP still employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share declined by 2.3 percent on the stock exchange .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto company , which has grown up with printers from California , is currently split into a new company - apart from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again disap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers according to its services put the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer up to the latest .
in the third quarter of the financial quarter at the end of July , shipments of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
this resulted in revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a split and massive post@@ ures on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company headed by Me@@ g Whit@@ man recently re@@ acted that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more business online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of some 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
but a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would mostly result in rejection : 54 percent opposed it , 35 percent agreed .
the fact that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria find 61 percent positive .
on the other hand , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian government , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of the respon@@ dents reject 20 per cent .
29 per cent did not decide .
car : second press day at 6@@ 6th IA@@ A
at the centre of the fair , there will be networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility until September 27 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Connec@@ ting Mobility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide public can visit the IA@@ A of Saturday .
the organizers of the V@@ DA car association reck@@ on , as two years ago , with some 900@@ ,000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took part in the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water laun@@ chers for several hundred refugees .
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed violence erup@@ tion at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line and behind the police officers stood there .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially used pe@@ pper@@ mint spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
as a result , the Group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little bit backward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas shri@@ ek@@ ed .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press officers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time of Dec@@ ision on Inter@@ est Rates for the US Central Bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US staff comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the present rate will last from 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since F@@ ed interest applied to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ ker , Head of Emplo@@ ye@@ es at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds of such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death Prot@@ ector at the Delta State University left ap@@ ology
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; during the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller about his name , but he did not give him .
lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen cir@@ cled him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb who supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who testi@@ fied that she was married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said Lamb had called relatives at a particular time on Monday to tell them , &quot; He is not going to prison . &quot;
when police caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University , like his life @-@ law on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their luck charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had several stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also allegedly tried to fight drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds up the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the work of the Group .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap eu@@ ro@@ ls .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was a contribution to profit of around € 500 million a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a board of directors for the passenger business in the future .
the cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings low @-@ cost airline should be developed as independent as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the management team headed by CEO Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
with the new creation , Spo@@ hr under@@ scores the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with whom the company plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines were operating under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with pilots
in the conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations will again be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the planned strike .
this is what the union has shared with .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement scheme for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year , cockpit wants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come as quickly as possible with a projected record result &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the pilot supply of the pilot , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa points out routes to the Group &apos;s own cheap line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United won &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outer champion to tears and will exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an el@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during defeat at PS@@ V
the England defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland @-@ Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball which was in a different direction so that it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows better The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a child care provider to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax decided to en@@ roll the environmental fa@@ bel published in 1971 by Dr Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a news on Super@@ camp &apos;s website and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my kids , because it always seems to give a picture or message we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the story@@ line of the book , instead returns an index of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ race @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the ma@@ iden of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
as if this were not yet suspect : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he agrees to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is devast@@ ated by the gre@@ edy , trees that need to be knit@@ ting , the need of knit@@ ting once @-@ ler , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s elec@@ tive bure@@ au .
Super@@ camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
pushing into Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the Ka@@ der who chose England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not exclude a victory victory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops himself as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity on the test level , is an option for the attack .
this news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the UK Test Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse .
during his seven tests there were two good ass@@ aults under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented towards results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this to - players are their own best choices .
long ago , the course of Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he &apos;s mainly a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I set high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and would get four Qui@@ cks appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred rounds immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s an Pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the coach .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game to bring a wealth of experience as he has played in all the conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh air , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
collaboration team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team actors do not specify the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are made of light hearted .
Bre@@ x@@ it ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ u if the economy falls into a l@@ ull by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ finished ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU will be deeply into trouble every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who strongly dis@@ sec@@ ts himself for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at &apos;s friend recently said that some member states are so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises as the EU is now and not always on their own fault , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they mostly do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it , if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s all about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wishes to look outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and shows that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and civil servants come to the point in some capitals that no matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as with the exagger@@ ated long har@@ sh@@ ers such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one .
it is difficult to imagine that they will get one leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not have deliber@@ ate comments in the SN@@ P style while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankruptcy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain won &apos;t win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press cann@@ on , as they were not during the refer@@ end@@ ums inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists , who made a name for themselves as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ gers , telephone @-@ min@@ ting foreigners and the Pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our large newspapers .
in fact Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noted that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly ch@@ ap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems at risk to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I express it in a friendly way - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wild companions of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ev@@ ism can say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary said &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ett &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as a shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the seventy @-@ seven years when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under all circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties on Monday evening after all reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Cameron cannot give a free ticket to Europe allowing him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities regarding EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ation@@ - economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric debate among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - in order to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined in to critici@@ ze Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lanc@@ et last month &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; based on the P@@ he &apos;s most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the statements &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed verification of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi@@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously supposed to receive British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports from tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco line of P@@ he participated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acknow@@ le@@ dges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most products with most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or limitations are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J claims have already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds a year .
by showing up @-@ to @-@ date evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former boss of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ on and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to do the kind of programs that are not broad@@ cast@@ ed by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience to place in hard @-@ fought time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC CEO , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC shows or sends programs that would clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not like medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice over to a first @-@ class time frame , because they want to reach as broad support as possible for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ on is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to see how this should be public @-@ right television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think that would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for assessments &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC most popular broad@@ casts reflect what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ day@@ gar@@ t presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ on should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue when they go to their hypo@@ sacred missions to justify 4 billion pounds of radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the broadcasting fee Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , all of you think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who have a lot of money for the £ 150 , wonder if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
David El@@ stein , former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also warned of the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its Rei@@ ter@@ thi@@ an mission to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate , and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain &quot; on public television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful were shown on TV , and with the commercial channels Alli@@ ances enter to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are heard with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the power @-@ up of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
nem@@ ato@@ des generally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani changed the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when he uses ultrasound on the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with pulses of light .
but Chal@@ c@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light , which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain by an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which are to be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : take the DL@@ R from 15 to 18 September with DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) is read in the characters of London Underground and the trademarks of the DL@@ R line , which turns into an image of a tank .
in September , a flock of weapons dealers will drive with the DL@@ R ... customers are asked to help stop the weapons trade fair .
the 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of cruel designs in Bank@@ sys .
a collective named Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a £ 6 pack of Allen keys , which claims &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops advertising space on the planet . &quot;

after Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become critical and attempt to bring political work to the public outside of galleries .
many artists join the work with activists in protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society .
the commu@@ ter commu@@ ter is another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters .
the Am@@ nesty International was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist who also works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that ruled around advertising for the weapons fair - by creating an Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich company advertisement , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger by introducing bright colours and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a fall of the British government and the guarantee that torture machines will not be tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons trade fair comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors get fantastic euph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those that I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance to student resi@@ dences is from easy to nerve @-@ stirring up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you come from , whether and where you &apos;ve taken Sab@@ bat@@ ting year , where you stand with respect to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ mite does not love or hate , because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people who you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were in flames and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people .
people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people attract and put on their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t think about getting into college with a relationship
intro@@ vert has received a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of speaking : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
making friendship through baking .
as you start the university at the climax of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to present yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain yourself and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you tap .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk @-@ owner .
the chances are good that they say that they use themselves , even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with them more balanced than my room@@ mate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the true sense of the pro@@ verb you belong to the people who sit in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl on my hall asked her neighbors , if it &apos;s something to make them qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with more lu@@ ke@@ warm music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep two hours before leaving her own music , closing her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally drag into the same residence hall ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be too much embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , take care of her , separate herself and then see her every day and perhaps witness how she moves all together .
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot co @-@ inhabit@@ ant is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk a little reason to your lower abdom@@ en .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys to lie in his not locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and M@@ ob@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good plot is funny , but it only takes moments when it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and put your keys in a glass of water which you put into the freezer - but stap@@ le their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , single parents , low @-@ income town@@ houses
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds row houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner valley .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need the living room but also the single mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how you can build even today cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thousands of refugees are forced to enter the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ ler believes to know how quickly cheaper housing can be created : he builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ lis , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain here for a large part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the next few decades . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ der : a terra@@ ced house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when you sub@@ vert the people in residential blocks .
each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be adapted easily according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have legally dra@@ fted my project .
especially complicated it always makes the lo@@ oming Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ verordnung regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no place for that .
and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which is definitely not true .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ bert : true , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need housing .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ner .
I show how you can build even today cheap and good .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to Get the New iPhone Operating System when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , type on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , since they receive an error message that tells you that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself will lead you through the rest of the process .
this may result in del@@ eting apps in order to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by linking up the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is close to a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may switch off half way and this could lead to abor@@ tion .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second stressed before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from defending champion and two @-@ fold champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races so far and takes the flood light Grand Prix in the city @-@ state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence Singapore &apos;s Grand Prix is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was established three months ago and added another member to his ranks , thus the number of members increased to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess player and tennis player , who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , who accepted Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to include chess players that cannot raise the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent research should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
district office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the social foundation &apos;s man@@ tle and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
besides advice , one can also take part in courses there .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened .
right next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or health care insurance services .
for years we have been working with our out@@ patient nursing staff that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the services of the insur@@ ers are not rarely used because the complexity of insur@@ ers is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ cra@@ ft and the citizen hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in the demographic change .
this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg vital in the future .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined during the inaugur@@ ation ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the reconciliation in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able contribution . &quot;
thus , the social foundation makes a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment as possible .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 noon .

Vienn@@ ese architect Karl M@@ ang died 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienn@@ ese architecture , is dead .
he died on 5th September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus shared on Tuesday .

men beating over 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man and struck him with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ leg and bleeding strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the cul@@ pri@@ t persecuted the group with a car up to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed many times over there .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male person .
under the help of a stick @-@ stick , one re@@ counts on the face and the th@@ ig@@ h of the victim .
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue tat@@ too description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 metres tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires practice in field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ aus@@ ausen .
furthermore , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business suppor@@ ter U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor , Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert , are also pleased .
doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf are missing in many places in the country - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has a good fortune : on October 1 , Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practical field breaks .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ aus@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months .
after a conversion phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he will invest 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros into the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first glance when the ri@@ ms met years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who is currently completing her professional training at the Ver@@ dener Hospital and wants to enter into practice in the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Kü@@ steh@@ aus and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time , I just ph@@ oned her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of doing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss coming soon .
and so it was agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Ober@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several doctor &apos;s offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed leading emergency doctor in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and volunte@@ ered in the DR@@ K willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ aus@@ ausen is a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the E@@ DP is completely renewed .
a total of 50,000 Euros will receive the mil@@ ler as part of a subsi@@ dy programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come into practice in field breaks every quarter , in North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another GP practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice taking place by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stop@@ aus@@ age .
if no successor had been found , she would have gone .
those who visit Müll@@ ers talk @-@ hour also continue to look above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their par@@ ting ends an era in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all , the doctors practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ aus@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little mel@@ anch@@ oly has already felt it after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we &apos;re still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband is laughing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;ve always pressed myself in front of gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple enjoys two grand@@ children and travels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also ramp@@ ed up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to ask for asylum can also do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus is on the supply and safety of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; clearly , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , not even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia denied &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue travelling towards Austria and Germany and possibly er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - above all in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen area .
as the minister pointed out , the Slov@@ ene wants to limit its borders to refugees but not to abri@@ dge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already attempted in the night hours for Tuesday to pass in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration .
the c@@ roati@@ an police could pick them up in the nearby cor@@ n@@ fields .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees are constantly meeting in the village of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
in the coming days , his country has some 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had so far led migrants to the Hungarian border , would conver@@ ge towards Croatia , harmon@@ izing Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was the people to adopt certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning there was a first bus with about 50 refugees arriving in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border crossing Serbia approximately 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary agreed , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west @-@ west route could actually come to the von Ob@@ ach@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive ways of border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good report to the country , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side , there are still around 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , leading to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border now is still unclear .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local emergency in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees at the present time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still not cleared mines for 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der businesses should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the investig@@ ators were given a total of over $ 100 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately trapped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case continued .
most of the defend@@ ants came from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ remedi@@ ation is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks , such as the volunteer workers .
while some pass@@ ant attacks the chal@@ k spontaneously and affir@@ ms the sentence &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; stopping the war &quot; or &quot; suffering long suffering , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with the dying .

therefore this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that not everyone wants to share in the tables publicly , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the topic of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , according to the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the Hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening up of people .
an assessment that shares Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted with the topic through personal experience , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was searching for volunteers , she immediately reported and was present at the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce of Saint Vincent .
they all are well trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see the life of another war@@ te , keep it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and con@@ fession@@ ally independent .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as training and supervision of the dying and mour@@ ning companions .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
other personal requests can also be recorded on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier giant lowered his profit prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his bid transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said gain a gain between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite the price increases , which are average 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for land transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that earnings will increase compared to the previous year as a result of cost reduction , higher revenue , and due to growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the Company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid yields if we take into account the weaker than expected economic conditions , above all in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex lost 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share that predicted twelve analysts asked by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales rose 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts estimated six of the analysts estimated $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipment to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales of land transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
express Un@@ ity recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labour costs in freight business .
in the market trading , about one hour before the opening , F@@ ed@@ Ex shares dropped by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most awaited session in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade .
lo@@ oming over them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ storey meeting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that F@@ ed chair@@ person Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data on the economy show that it grows soli@@ dly , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising interest rates for federal securities - and be it only a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they can observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , head econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the heigh@@ tened uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les itself to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently surv@@ eyed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a drop in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value jumped by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in explaining the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest would ease the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good enough to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the proposition was expected .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases showed signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that slow@@ ing the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market tur@@ mo@@ il affect the complex calculation , when it is necessary to increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred over the past few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it predic@@ ts that it will wait at least a month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved technically in its decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Curren@@ cy Office has become the world .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere indication of the suff@@ erer Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that seem not to be associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
lacquer , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest increase , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability to the first place only during a severe crisis such as the European market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly won &apos;t get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is am@@ ended , I don &apos;t think it should advance the time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

the shop is huge and it takes about an hour to stroll through the cor@@ rid@@ ors .
if the whole shopping makes you hungry , there is a meal at the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express for you .
the car@@ c@@ ass ( good and inexpensive ) in this shop is close to the cash des@@ ks and has several shopping options .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Leben@@ shilfe für Flüchtlinge
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to prepare a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 l@@ ences .
every Thursday they are doing it at the asylum seekers home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite different than at a real school .
Brazilian pedi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS aims to elu@@ ci@@ date women on how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck to breasts with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ese approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat@@ ter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited gym@@ nasi@@ um on Bern@@ ese &apos;s sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest municipal council meeting , the completed construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the committee had decided on an application for an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the applicable construction plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ clear first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; declared mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again , it was about the ti@@ lt that should lie down below ten degrees for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof ti@@ lt did not permit any &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ ese municipal council generally tends to be more restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ating orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recurring project for the construction of a gym@@ nasi@@ um : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are estimated at around 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected from school and lati@@ tude promotion .
in the next process step , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre hall will now be presented to the Land@@ rats@@ amt ( Land@@ rats@@ amt ) .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg will be closed earlier than planned - 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is reflected in the surprising plans of the county seat of the county , which confirmed land@@ owner Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision is made by the Supervisory Board , and the day to come Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the existing interior station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees were informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this was in any case an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years fis@@ her with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to this , both houses will lead , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which still has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital has been completed .
according to rum@@ ours , Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , claims that the house , which is owned by the Federal Council , is to be used as accommodation for asylum applications in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily sych@@ iat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the quasi @-@ relo@@ cation to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief doctor for more than 30 years have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened again and again over the past decades , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are required tonight ( 8 : 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .
the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is indeed the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is none .
in the past season , the ba@@ thers in Bh@@ c have suffered a painful defeat and have something to do there .
Jag@@ ü@@ tage with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the aber@@ ration on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( District of Wit@@ tenberg ) several hunters were in action , as the police were sharing .
after a shot of fire , an 63@@ - and 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were transferred to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was clear at first .
the criminal police as@@ cer@@ tained .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in interro@@ gation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young were killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a breach of violence since Saturday .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ utor and police said on Wednesday .
as a suspect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday night was also considered to be indic@@ ted and investig@@ ators led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman the investig@@ ators first encountered personal objects of the victim .
in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , there was finally a suspicion of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpet@@ rator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee allegedly admitted to the police interro@@ gation that killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead .
information on the circumstances of the act should bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gaps
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable home .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution campaigns in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people push for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be completed in Germany .
this means that 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many then come across the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of the asylum seekers have been living in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is shooting a deficit in housing , which is growing year by year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , around 77@@ 0.000 residential units were missing in the metro@@ politan areas , Matthias Günther compla@@ ins , author of the study .
many working people therefore lived in large cities necessarily in shared rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the l@@ utes on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has declined for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance proposes a restart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost the social housing construction again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this way , the basic income tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be suspended .
in addition , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation options are required according to the Alliance .
the support programme for state bank Kf@@ W refugee shel@@ ters is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start on Monday evening , with 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been declared .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia judge corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary is practically no more going through , since more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces its passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the abolition of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees fled to Croatia in order to reach Western Europe from there .
500 people had come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports Croatian television channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the previous day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws , which came into effect on the same day , practically obvi@@ ate the need for proper asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic ple@@ aded : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , refugees do not encounter border f@@ ences .
there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
after the closure of the border , hardly any more refugees arrive to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police had 3@@ 66 challenged people .
just before the gate closure on Monday there were 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws determine the overcoming and damage of the Grenz@@ z@@ a@@ uns as a crime .
therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed in Hungary .
prisoners are threatened with imprisonment up to five years and expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the new &quot; Tran@@ sit zones &quot; established on the border , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees .
in practice , however , no one has any prospect of granting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported to this place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past weeks .
barrier grids have been disman@@ tled and one of the warehouse in the border area has been rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
around the 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government information .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the further drive to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped at the orders of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , small groups of refugees regularly met on foot .
mayor was &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy with the clean up when ten people were suddenly standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor , Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flood of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and struck the stu@@ ds along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we were once again stun@@ ned by the un@@ hoped guests , with snacks and drinks .
we said immediately , we bring her by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; this was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers switched to a regional train in W@@ els on Sunday evening in W@@ els , in order to make it to Germany after the short @-@ term announcement that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but to try again beyond the border .
the regional train , however , was placed before the border at W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , day before a two @-@ bridge run sports - organized by Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more than thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of hypo@@ critical politics :
instead of ai@@ ding R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly put the attitude of the Hungarian government into the ha@@ ze circle of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing surge of refugees and the approaching winter to create decent conditions for people seeking protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant lod@@ gings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all hands full to do with the refugee support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is accustomed to the fact that his word has a weight .
the government used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up districts for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first acquisition centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , pra@@ ising the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad comp@@ utes a demand of 8@@ 5,000 qu@@ arti@@ s in the he@@ ur@@ igen year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation units will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to deploy the countries , 15,000 the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there &apos;s no barrel without floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the govern@@ ors .
they would have assured him to make lod@@ gings even for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Con@@ rad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also puts great expectations into the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private persons can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that lod@@ gings must comply with a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the duties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to be valid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , was more successful in accommodation , founded Konrad with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you don &apos;t say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier are not responsible for the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
so far , our own search for districts has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz challenges a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , since those affected can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in case of an emergency , however , further locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism exercises the chief of the city on the partition of refugees within the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other districts must also contribute here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
in a long telephone conversation with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has cor@@ ted further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuation of refugees to the FR@@ G is still possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
the guards , however , were brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is now also introducing controls on its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gener@@ alization of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly listed IT Group has moved into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ hausen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the Neue Wer@@ ft and later acquired which to acquire .
from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
S &amp; T invested € 1.7 million in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
in fact Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to gain a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old propriet@@ or of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : finally , she now has grown in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and appar@@ el of different manufacturers , everything is now about women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have thought for a long time whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was decisive for the decision , among other things , that the Fur@@ la @-@ producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Linz Greater Region who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has caught Br@@ eit from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women get into rap@@ ture at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman cannot answer with the last safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag re@@ uses every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called en@@ co@@ ders .
some people also have this property with billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he expresses himself alien@@ ated , journalists troubled or revealed knowledge gaps in international crisis politics - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls up the campaign .
and cuts off well .
this is also recorded in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fresh@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the wine village on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 inhabitants area are related to him over -@@ eigh@@ ty corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but are not so pro@@ found@@ ly impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous offspring , to which alongside Tr@@ ump also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) , so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the hearts there .
there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also the opinion that &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit of a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
accidentally loud the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to High German : the en@@ co@@ ders , she says .
Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the don@@ ors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundations of the real estate company were the first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their home in the long run failed in the Bavarian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once cut off without permission , the Director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen Geschichte und Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly spoken against Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; it &apos;s not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant k@@ ump ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born th@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement considers the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so bur@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ at a visit , which is generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine this from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t win the election , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award in the neighbouring country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews .
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the Executive Board did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise achieved an average 39@@ ,000 spectators with the five capitals , compared to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ ,000 ) , but its number remained behind that last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sun@@ rise closed the gap in recent months .
in August , Today , today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the gap between 40,000 and 50.000 was completed .
up to now in September , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ er@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ael Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down in New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics have wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the ra@@ fts star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ 6,000 spectators on average .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour , 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ seed average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to mig@@ rate the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secrets uncovered ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki are obviously un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly showing who the b@@ achel@@ or wins .
the woman , who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was covered with the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows day before coming from three two , you might accidentally have given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed up to the final on Thursday
all three women have ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as a reason why they like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you who were to receive W@@ oods last rose &quot; could become their answers to the game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or .
everyone named Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went home and noticed energies ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now att@@ un@@ ed to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the b@@ achel@@ or will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .
originally released as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent requests for their impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ key as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ting at his first punch return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
he encouraged Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the match .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ cam Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ators Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his crazy catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine any worse start in his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 , when a pass with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free voters call for the setting of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee figures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn Chamber in Groß@@ Wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , when there are not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to prevent the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get gra@@ dations in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Free Cho@@ ose State Department conven@@ es Friday to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
in fact , quite other main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now also dominated by the free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lay the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as there were during the Yugosla@@ vian wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it goes no further , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Thin@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why Ai@@ v@@ ek also called for more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum proceedings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform federal standards nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria shifts , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the regional policy should not fall under the table in a big city .
a long @-@ standing favourite is on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Ministry of Education , Ludwig @-@ Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started pilot study &quot; intermediate level plus , &quot; where an extension of the secondary school is tested from three to four years .
but that &apos;s not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be spe@@ eded up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want to .

solid Wall Street helps Da@@ x to jump on jumps
the German stock market has closed law@@ less and nervous trades with profits over long distances .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shooting rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd , demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police took tear gas and then shot in the air before they resor@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ ls used , which are known to be able to kill , but which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative apparently produced such a high rate of death .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed as part of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent disputes since the 10th .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the building plot at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there is still no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den wants to market around 4000 square metres of land in close proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commercial and living .
wait for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city .
what investor in@@ quired is not yet clear .
no contracts have been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Große Straße , already bought a few months ago and demoli@@ shed the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
the plans for a holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ li@@ eger are more worried - they fear the sale of their leisure flight
months past closed doors were negotiated , greeted , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
the prospective , medium @-@ sized company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , who accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end went on the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
fierce reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners , who had come to the meeting , sum@@ mon@@ ed the images and new details to the desired hotel structure .
Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea , and a member of the board of directors of the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this will be a huge block that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears , like several other project critics , that traffic would increase strongly due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whole loads must come to make this happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans were still variable .

Google starts double donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc . ( O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations as they flee from war @-@ torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately look for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / in order to be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

weight loss surgery may be helpful for easily overweight diabe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss sur@@ geri@@ es or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital established data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c flu@@ ff - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition worsen@@ ed completely and at 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent , and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy unit ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete reduction of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show any survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study did not benefit from the survival of the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said that it is soothing for persons with BM@@ I among 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long , until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic modifications that have strongly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is currently being noticed in the fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed against the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not adequate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing in their countries is less@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the United States dra@@ gged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallow a strongly alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant , according to Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of Rev@@ en@@ ue of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age reported the poison control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children are intentionally drinking disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mutation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing to children .
suspended disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , especially for small children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Po@@ ison Centre at K@@ ans@@ as University Hospital , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ infection in reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry dro@@ pp@@ elling disinf@@ ect@@ ants at school , was brought to an emergency treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her in the Medical Center of Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hanging disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario for the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
health authorities employees suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active substance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher by laying anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the s@@ worn map as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and dismissed disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic Games any more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there &apos;s a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see those games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ à accepts that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following departure from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who are now at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ à said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly - but we must go on .
we really need Celtic support , because that makes the players better .
coming together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously in January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he split a few January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ ti@@ ously at the signing of new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to interfere with the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer windows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this high season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group during this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic cat@@ erer Mic@@ u with reference guide
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , talked with Celtic during the transfer period , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract expi@@ red at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a ru@@ sty k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les for two years and has not made the departure from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts set on S@@ FA @-@ battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Defender &apos;s Red Card was later rev@@ oked - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insisted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no performance commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ics
the incor@@ rigi@@ ble hi@@ bee was corrected after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts via Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ as@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ass@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s executive board still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but conf@@ esses that the decline in the field of play has to end .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has faith in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to tro@@ t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen was desperate to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to win a seventh consecutive League victory giving them a gap of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no team that won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , which games of this kind won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is rising overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was above that of the 5.5 percent U@@ K@@ s , as demonstrated by figures from the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken interfer@@ ed with the process
as security personnel could not paci@@ fy the situation , the police called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officers could take the stor@@ ks into custody .
a breath alcohol test resulted in a 16 year old 0,@@ 89 Pro@@ mil@@ le .
the adolescents were picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 pro@@ mil@@ le and first stayed in custody .
why I am Wit@@ ness to an Exec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses during his death .
the invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and since more applications are available as places , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ sy &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities tell me that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a bl@@ amed me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; form@@ ulate it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong to do what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ad@@ ware , a re@@ porter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to enter all details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would owe him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man After wet police persecution , persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist stayed dry when he talked the guy from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang down the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec was not too enthusiastic about getting his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
team soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards have tried to spy on him and he threat@@ ens to end the race sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobal@@ t test specimen at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted head and I want my owners to think that I will try my best for them .
when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart , sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy at rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it is personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I &apos;m it .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I am saying has now let them think about it .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have built up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t investigation , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s leg , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my collabor@@ ators wrong@@ ly applied mud on my leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was also the case .
but it also had this on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested after driver &apos;s flight
the police arrested a man on the weekend following a collision with a cycli@@ st and following driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram .
the bicy@@ cli@@ st was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the car driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats Riv@@ vals for claims of w@@ rest@@ ling
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy described criticism of the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agenda setting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely disgu@@ ised note to the Storm Team after his team achieved the Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the tac@@ kling of his team and said that they were only concentrated on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team was confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this time and again this time of the year shows up .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting soccer &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said that he would take care of a mess .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this .
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
they didn &apos;t think about us six weeks ago when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co versus Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm Team released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys , or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the semi @-@ final at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guaran@@ te@@ ed for Dru@@ gs
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ long sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ ous declarations of the two people , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Justice Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he gives his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police every day and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
in case of a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noted it too late and tried in vain to devi@@ ate to the left in the last moment , as the police told him .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ maker was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 p.m .
there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le for sending images
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ us used the telephone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of un@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the confused messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzing computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research that used terms for the search for non @-@ permanent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction , that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the search on the computer was carried out by him , but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the defend@@ ant used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty , in the sense of the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year to have viol@@ ated the requirements and did not appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked for Ho@@ gg to not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no considerable sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the sentence until October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case , Ho@@ gg was granted security deposit but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings on other cases pending .
he was added to the directory of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the judgment .
slu@@ gs switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken off the border control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
from fear of discovery and arrest , many traffi@@ ckers were increasingly involved in smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said .
along the river river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the Land@@ kreise Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and st@@ ow@@ ls to the German side .
there they are taken in reception by federal police and for@@ warded to the registration .
compared to the start of the week on Wednesday , the Munich Central Station met again significantly more refugees .
some 700 people arrived in the state capital from 8 : 00 to 8 : 00 pm , said a spokesman in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : exp@@ ir@@ ation of tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air currently streams into the country , divided the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful deep down is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic over the last days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected above all in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Con@@ stance with arches from 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the mass makes it : every two years the car makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , it is mainly moving to the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
the compact class cars are currently in great demand : approximately 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Statisti@@ cal Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( IA@@ A ) ( 17th to 27th September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Rüssel@@ sheim / Frankfurt . Opel is taking a step below the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16,@@ 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra boasts a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse provide further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which for the first time also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door Astra .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which can also be seen at the IA@@ A .
and what will happen next to the Astra on the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as five @-@ door in a conventional and one accentu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan depos@@ itor wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications with 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe will be launched in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is visible at the International Motor Show ( IA@@ A ) .
on the outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger raised above all hands on the front end : here , the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the modified spotlight was equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch@@ screen and integrated for the first time with Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the consolidated Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
the Federal Constitutional Court gave a right to an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary prison Te@@ gel , who had been placed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners basically claim financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked into tight spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
with this , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful in Karlsruhe with his constitutional complaint : he was housed in a single cell with a surface area of around five square meters between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , is now on the free walk , had been moved to a larger cell .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , his arrest warrant for the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dge raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re@@ viewing there .
they see man &apos;s dignity hurt .
Kammer@@ gericht will now decide on the amount of compensation
even if , due to legal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were decisive , it was said that there was no compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear a wor@@ rying of the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of financial compensation .
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
thus they only spoke in April to a det@@ ain@@ ee of damages because he was locked in a cell naked .
according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , human dignity is also un@@ worthy of the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed a decent housing to a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a homo@@ geneous cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were in the head@@ lines in recent weeks due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even fights are due to the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Press Office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not staff@@ ed due to the lack of young men , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what happens in Germany ?
according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) Germany , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated his determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again , we can do this and we will do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens in Germany gives the following overview .
according to various progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Building Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as is currently being built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the shortage of living space is dramatic above all for affordable rental objects . annually , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing benefits from rental prices , and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s point of view is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a common agreement between scientists and federal ministers in the fact that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( Institut für Arbeitsmarkt@@ - und Berufs@@ forschung ) , the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
however , refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find employment in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
labour is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the society of admission , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says Mig@@ ration@@ alist Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the throne , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work .
whereas in former times there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the residence requirement that asylum seekers have limited to a home .
in society - also because of the lack of skilled labour - the point of view is mostly enforced by the fact that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
so far there is still no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that workplaces are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore , according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the kit@@ ches , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is important to keep the family together , &quot; Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokesman for youth and family in Berlin &apos;s Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators is increasing by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacity by allowing more professional schools .
in the countries , students without German knowledge will be prepared for the lessons .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have qualifications in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 per cent of the refugees wish to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal land forbi@@ ds asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his position .
admission to the higher education institution could be facilit@@ ated .
because refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ dung do not receive any benefits after the asylum application law if they start a study .
the latter generally do not receive a b@@ ill@@ board , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to a ban .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ o@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
however , this gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively with@@ hold the same rights to Islam as they have the churches and further develop the existing state @-@ churches right to a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it is also important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association that takes care of newcom@@ ers .
duties are also part of the rights .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give him some control options .
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to discharge such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law into Arabic .
integration will be a topic of the whole society in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also need to change the majority society , reducing discrimination and racism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a law of gender equality since a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it slowly learns how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored by the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and stakeholders of non @-@ white German have long been calling for and why international agreements like anti @-@ racism , Germany commit , must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Prof. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding man@@ - power and capacity , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all newcom@@ ers to hand over health cards right away .
services rendered could later be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to det@@ ach so many people with the limited capacity catalog , which the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , the doctors mainly make the language barriers create .
so far , the Berlin Health Scienti@@ st The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more poorly informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ters would have to be taken over , she demands .
however , many refugees have also been assisted by more general medical care centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a different diagnostic look .
in the case of refugee children , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and for the young people it is about HIV education .
with some of the other illnesses German doctors come from her training , but it is clear that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ asi@@ tism or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of doctors , it may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would need to prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations once more .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most people suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from the so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
Mun@@ z explained , in order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the processing usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social welfare offices , mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether or not a therapy is necessary .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege loads to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new staging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on a brick @-@ was@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal trainer and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for enthusiasts lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their everyday lives and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cocktail cocktail with cosmop@@ olitan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cuban duo wants to easily take up .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to capture women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Celeb@@ ration also fascin@@ ates with intuition and agi@@ lity .

W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascinated with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a topic with different animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , it is not good for us either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every match .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
the upper@@ most commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little JU@@ M@@ BO was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst tells .
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or one 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites visitors from 17 to 20 September every day at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock .
on Sunday the programme starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is the family day , for the show at 5@@ pm the prices are reduced .

Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , desc@@ ended from a podium down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by statements by MPs from the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesman of the Democratic Change Movement ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the affected Parliament members that immunity in the Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split up into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and service activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and diversified portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; said the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to tackle the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this sector based on the conviction that tightly focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal master Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says team mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four matches for England and in view of its history , his involvement in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of violation does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger acknowledged , there is the associated risk of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries has 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 von Arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two premi@@ er league clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 that have experienced most of the injury days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a prone period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveling to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and allow the players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where the Richter scale was measured 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains driven by the far hope of leading the association to his first European victory in Europe with his management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year pole .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the issue , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the goal of questioning the culture that hin@@ ders men from seeking help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominant .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health far more deeply .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was turned up@@ side down .
every character was not defined by his work but by his personality , shining through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football gu@@ esses in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case , even if they often lag behind to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a co @-@ worker of telep@@ hon@@ y care , I explained : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am cop@@ ing with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that makes me sense when trying to provide long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the completely re@@ designed cou@@ lis@@ se for the celebration of the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - all of the 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to crush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his victory against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met for less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ u@@ ble as PS@@ G player who took the French master , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Transpar@@ ez@@ k Don@@ et@@ sk also in the A group , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they not only aim for the kno@@ ck@@ out for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it wasn &apos;t a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the door . later he was replaced with his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he began his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t achieved one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three modifications to the Paris @-@ Team , which on the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who took PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why , when he entered in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and to the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who struck Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps @-@ posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they did little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes got up , with some mis@@ sp@@ outs and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who didn &apos;t bother with less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which turned Di Maria into a shooting , which was led by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . in doing so , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth season gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi found a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion league game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games do not suff@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
keep your hat off Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Glen@@ core raises $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
the Swiss @-@ based mining giant Glen@@ core , who is affected by collap@@ sing raw material prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt plan .
the Glen@@ core company registered in London stated in an explanation that it has sold new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion pounds to pay its own debt .
the company , which lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling raw material prices as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and has a devastating impact on markets .
the subscription rights issue brought Glen@@ core Stock Exchange to the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning .
the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Glen@@ core has announced last week the 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay about a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion equi@@ ties worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by around half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .
refugees arrive in Weimar
on Tuesday , 49 people after a mostly long flight reach the city administration in Weimar .
the refugees come from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia .
the youngest newcom@@ er is a six @-@ month old girl from Syria .
white House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese president Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confir@@ ming the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , X@@ is first official in Washington , will take place on 25 September and reci@@ proc@@ ates President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the U.S. President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State dinner after the two leaders have had bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President X@@ is visit will be the opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but also President Obama and President Xi also give the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , will probably meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington , before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi meet a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber @-@ pion@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008
world champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago shortly before Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner , four times champion league winner , two times champion league champion , twice champion league champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to Qatar for al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he was just before the Euro 2008 farewell to Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , Madrid won everything , we did nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ bl@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann acquired the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i was not changed
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I have played a great European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s playing time in 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the whole distance on the lawn , the reds sprang out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph in the end .
Matt Dam@@ on playing variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on faced the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she wasn &apos;t needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen scenario .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the lin@@ eup of the film and not at the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and shou@@ ted &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian adher@@ ed .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said initially . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te , beaten by her white col@@ der .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film . Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Po@@ oni s Twitter user expressed his anger over the clip , writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talking about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement had a nationwide impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured restra@@ int .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album quiet weaker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elizabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already made the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prize of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished her 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten until the final .
climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge in three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had earned more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has any res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad it &apos;s Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had exchanged roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
mint A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
formerly they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but on Tuesday they played perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the T@@ wins wa@@ ved a chance to climb within a half @-@ season of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Kis@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck six times in the 1 / 3 inner ings and made three races possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and so I want to go quite concentrated in the game .
the designated tiger hat Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two rounds , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle mar@@ in@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the Schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked mark@@ edly better from the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back meeting at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ te , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who took a two @-@ run escape to the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th consecutive podium in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe made a double play
when Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inner courtyard , the wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the level of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed ed@@ ged S@@ ano from three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
in the beginning of the game , Detroit benefited from a still not mo@@ ve@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three rounds in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been deleted from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first one , H@@ ushes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play with a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the runner in the sc@@ oring position .
the third ba@@ z@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers laid in the second , achieved a One @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single of center Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor .
he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J@@ .A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns at six hits and a walk with four strokes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , who has been on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August due to a shoulder strain , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is crossed by the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was lacking in the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to join in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden shared on Tuesday evening .
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 coming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily accommod@@ ated there .
they are then to be distributed to other communities .
over the past ten days , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse , according to the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium of Gie@@ ßen , who was responsible for the initial up@@ take .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German military measures in Syria an option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective observation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , it was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict arises craw@@ ling in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , and no one will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives in Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not so far failed to agree on a common action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Angela Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of deliber@@ ation with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , also be@@ mo@@ p them .
but if you don &apos;t have a pencil , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view was strongly divided in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort of force &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to tie down the border with Romania by fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbor country is different from Serbia as the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers looking for alternative routes across Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of other migrants reported on the way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the polar tail of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sp@@ li@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what researchers conclude from observations of the spatial son@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the moon is fli@@ r@@ ting slightly on its path around the Ring Plan@@ ets .
although this movement is small , but still too big for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discovered ice volcan@@ oes in the South Pole of Saturn in 2006 , sp@@ lashing water vap@@ or and ice particles and feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama missing several weeks in Munich
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 1860 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; München &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has to for@@ go Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich @-@ based lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably four weeks of forced break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the potential commitment of an in@@ compatible professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high levels of sugar - mainly su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless : they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
for those who eat the fruits , it supports sight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when purchasing , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too rigid and smell pleasantly .
the peel colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first f@@ atten@@ ing tower , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps @-@ west side of the fo@@ eh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and the night on Thursday the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ al valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a decline in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area above the British Is@@ les in a strong south@@ western current .
on the west side of the Alps the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows in the F@@ öhn@@ valleys with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
in some places , the hair dryer can penetrate into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow on the alpine slope .
here the rain stops , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , over 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the next 48 hours .
on Thursday morning the blow f@@ ells out , and in a row a cold front rolls with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind fresh@@ ens up to stor@@ my and the temperatures go back significantly .
the following days present themselves in the north , with 15 to 20 degrees Celsius , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther place
just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Reform@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of ancient Rome just beside the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of pop@@ es could only live in secret for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the place will become visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a rotten sin @-@ maker .
his negative impressions are likely to have encouraged him by historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then commen@@ ced the split of the Western Church with his thesis against the aband@@ on@@ ment of aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 designs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means the same with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subjects of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
he immediately became fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the scrip@@ tures on the basis of painting .
he interpreted the scrip@@ tures selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into current contex@@ ts .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original quotation from Martin Luther and a set of the artist who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the up@@ bringing started with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work on it , perhaps to carry me back to the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is that art becomes more and more important in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; today , the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising , and that is loud .
symbo@@ lis@@ m is being displaced .
artists have another pleasure and pleasure to show things .
images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall into the images &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; letting them appear , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday , Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost attended the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible presentation at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I have not paid attention to fully gr@@ asp@@ ing the Bible , but also selecting the most important and mysterious topics for him .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; this is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15 .
construction begins for BM@@ X rail
plans were made , place found , company commissioned to model earth hills for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X run@@ way it was finished again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ uss , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to train the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hills secluded , new place sought - well with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will go down in October , the first municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate with the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B enlar@@ ges its commitment to refugees from 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga posts a clear sign on the weekend .
the football re@@ acts to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in dealing with the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t work for me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the state minister Mrs Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and may help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the decisive turn@@ out must put politics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; explained Nier@@ s@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some Bundes@@ liga also support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professionals will sign a clear sign when they will wear &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sport chief Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama of refugees goes to everyone , nobody is allowed to see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can help football feder@@ alists , no , we must use our beam power , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements in their locations had started their own projects is great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government , provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported K@@ id@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : head of the Board of SAP lost an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the head of the head of Europe &apos;s largest software company Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t has lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he had fallen into a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , fain@@ ted , then dra@@ gged himself out on the street - he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quotes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP Co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner all the time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren &apos;t Re@@ placement Pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he fell from the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as a spare driver for both Stam@@ pe@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button during the weekend in Singapore , like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ out eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have definitely been sm@@ ashed .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga Top Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ nel will not only change its stem position on the R@@ eus position .
he announced a change at the goal keeper position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place from the Roman citizen &apos;s Roman citizen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether fashion f@@ ellers compete in the future in all European league games , however , Tu@@ k@@ kel left open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the for@@ ge statement by fellow player R@@ eus that the final draw for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , keeps mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead the lead for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will in Germany , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the changing of cars .
the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper on Wednesday from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Auto Show IA@@ A of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure traffic jams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together at the IA@@ A with representatives of industry .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio .
there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks be imposed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to advocate a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver gets more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should not be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimated the value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany by 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday on the AA survey commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not count at all at all in 20 years .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents account for up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to fully rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , at least 15 percent could be envis@@ aged in flowing traffic , 45 percent in traffic .
well , every fourth would leave the car under control under any circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins that look frigh@@ ten@@ ingly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I was the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was ble@@ ak in the past , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely opa@@ que work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed total work of art for which much effort has been done : to indulge the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list has been dedicated .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , M@@ acher has spent 14 tons of material in Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather trousers out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can also see Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , timi@@ d fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the fashion of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as a fashion niche
it used to be on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers , which they used for example covering ceilings and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working alone , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en company .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en lace fashion , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past bull po@@ ets , is a growing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ desp@@ okes P@@ lau@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien along with nine other companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken .
private specialist shops and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays the mass @-@ ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is almost exclusively sold via chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , current to Russia and the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points on how C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been running a quality seal since this year , which shows that we are ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger regional office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why an existing design often only varies slightly to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic Schne@@ eb@@ all@@ spitze .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mith master@@ mind Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who would like to have a souvenir .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be touched , but Disney still we@@ ars a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it is not about a new movie but a kind of continuation that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magic children &apos;s girl .
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
the economy has to open up to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday to a group that was t@@ asked with steering the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should try to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting innovation and pushing forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Leadership Group has adopted a number of policies including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is drawn up , which identifies sectors and companies that do not question for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarantees a right @-@ wing business environment and is more open to the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy vis @-@ à @-@ vis foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double the level of mercury in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to measure the consumer a clearly higher dose of the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding labour paper in the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and small children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
even today , large predat@@ ory fish are so heavily poll@@ uted with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehensible .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU according to F@@ ood@@ watch wants to tigh@@ ten limit values for other fish currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries such as car@@ p are usually so low loaded that they already comply with the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolfgang Sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly po@@ ison@@ ous to humans , which is heavily enriched over the food chain , especially in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts can be particularly beneficial for un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry says on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum levels , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily caused by the burning of coal into the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of the Environment , German coal @-@ fired power plants receive more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount emit@@ ted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for instance in Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and sur@@ passed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already become the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
