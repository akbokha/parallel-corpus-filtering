Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but at the meeting , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement building and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal of the two further deterior@@ ated by the deal signed by Obama for the Iranian nuclear program .
in March Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , which was partially interpreted as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had declined with reference to the election in Israel at that time .
in an emergency call professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told him with a somewhat trem@@ bling voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was very important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was stuck on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police officer Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after that .
until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or a criminal incident .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies towards problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he was also a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not guarantee an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus the police found Lam@@ bs track later when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he completed his doc@@ torate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met with friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool old guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
he was the women &apos;s flock at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls melted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were both coming up on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a B@@ ark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of 5th September for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was the president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the watch @-@ watch , while the University &apos;s &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that he described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less workers for Christmas time
To@@ ys R Us states that there are not so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plane to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres across the country . in the 2014 Christmas season , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .

while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p stores with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Princess Diana &quot; &quot; &quot;
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it seems to me that I am a simulated g@@ ist and an arm length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ disputed the biggest travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN CEO says there is no military solution in Syria
general Secretary Ban K@@ i @-@ Moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN CEO once again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the periph@@ ery of the General Meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ separ@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national poll@@ s showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously question what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them won only one state in the Nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ ump &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to drop their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ umps Most Pop@@ ular values turned 180 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa stated last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see tr@@ ump temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pre @-@ voting state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his ministry , and almost six of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they set up their v@@ ault hats , republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the final cycle four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters see the campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump still beats everybody .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to lead to dr@@ umps while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support is distributed to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support tr@@ ump say they have forgiven their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can truly say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but elec@@ tors who say they have formed their opinion are twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in the issue of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration was a pi@@ vot@@ al and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic way of expressing tr@@ ump @-@ decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans will be kept away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post Survey of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in case of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do .
the fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all by their out@@ sider status .
six of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans were frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea area .
in the street , a square meter of a roof roof costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the supply of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter is the most expensive .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , one of the prices comes as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German housing sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter , well @-@ noticed .
but good , who can afford it ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; München &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not at the top here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double go@@ al@@ keeper in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to FC Bayern 3 : 0 near Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ re@@ aus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have launched a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their match in the Champions League at the Greek Record Champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ es Hit ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series is to be the first step towards the finale on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t after Munich .
in his 28 matches in the Champions League in the Champions League , Müller received the assistance of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had given him a thought @-@ out shot by the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans in front of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated concept without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the top class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here in 2011 ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously with their offensive efforts , but often too resour@@ ceful to work .
the attacks were often initiated by a game shift on the left @-@ hand lane Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner of the door .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct mail , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although the Bav@@ arians had used their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set needle @-@ stit@@ ches .
but on Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er there was forgiveness .
for instance , when he ste@@ ered a shot of ide@@ ye over the l@@ atin ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before New Gu@@ ardi@@ ola , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ der , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero had given the green light only after gradu@@ ating , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to do something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still got one .
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern fans in their audience block apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ re@@ aus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with striking blocks against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not harm only the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam .
the good news : when doing so , the risk drops quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is the result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 % barrels .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphasize authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore due to frequent fl@@ esh@@ ed inflammation in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Er@@ stau@@ tor Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people have to convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said head of study H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and leads to good dental health right up to high age .
in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population is affected at age 65 to 74 years , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists come to Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ nants of late Anti@@ quity
for the repeated time at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne Arch@@ eological finds have been made .
near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
during all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department for archaeological monument preservation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards , archae@@ ologists were now found to be five .
it was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that probably belonged to the church .

European Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
in order to improve the dispute over the proposed trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private mediation facilities for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which is clearly more traditional in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
through TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world is set to rise to 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ gements .
until now , the parties involved agreed with each other to arbit@@ rators , but there was no obj@@ ections to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it intends to work on an international investment court .
there could , for example , be clari@@ fied also disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , which , above all , is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , in which companies can control the compensation of tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals by the European Commission as inadequate .
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated Free Trade Agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German econom@@ ist Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considers essential points in the reform that the Federal Economic Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel has worked out in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European corporate association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economy &apos;s pi@@ ge@@ ability by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially small and medium @-@ sized businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) have been concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer lasting .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ dly acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of various places he always records on the map , wor@@ ding his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were born and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderfully creative mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared clever@@ ly composed songs , which harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift at any time into a great opul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ aving series : each of the 50 US states should be discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and close to the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive impact . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a comprehensive masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thinking of ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the US Bill@@ board Charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth full studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b .
since the smaller clubs have long gone out , the stage shows become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ ko .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five member band through Germany .
in the dark @-@ held ham@@ bur@@ gers More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the much more mature St@@ ev@@ ens turns back to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience one hears : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and one can thus throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate in essence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after an en@@ core is St@@ ev@@ ens humble himself , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and eventually bowed to thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ n &apos;s debut at the Fra@@ gran@@ ces of the Prime Minister
since his election , Mr Cor@@ n &apos;s debut is expected at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ming session with suspen@@ se
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ming session and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to hold a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence during the fall of the National An@@ them has prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several newspaper stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respect of silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , said in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called for differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stac@@ king &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Mr Cor@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour should make changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow @-@ Labour and R@@ ent Minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been T@@ ory Head over the Dis@@ patch box over the last decade .
the Labour leader who promised another politi@@ cian says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ative and that he will refrain from serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow of Economic Affairs Minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also brought up the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy Theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was seen with the prime minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the verdict of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that she had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

Po@@ unds Incre@@ ases by Acc@@ eler@@ ated W@@ age Growth in the United Kingdom
the pound increased le@@ aps of data which indicate an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . parallel to that , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s goal .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and most er@@ ased assessments of the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % vis @-@ à @-@ vis the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 compared to the euro .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a leap of 20 % after taking over offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Glen@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that it took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the Mon@@ di packaging and paper company were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set its assessment for the company R@@ ating on sale .
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports lending company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

Pe@@ gi@@ da plac@@ ard puts Lebanese on a potato @-@ ton@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - and indeed in the potato @-@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ ant Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he accidentally saw on TV .
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes , revol@@ ves around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has to be registered in the patent office in Munich in the meantime .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just as much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also comes well with its customers .
met@@ a starts a campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ alli@@ c has launched a campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ aboli@@ c and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing over social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ alli@@ c will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and appliances conduc@@ ts its annual investor strategy day .
there is a lot in the game since South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will s@@ nat@@ ch around five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley appreciated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 million revenues per year and met@@ a $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year , generating revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , met@@ a loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley expects Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s to fall in the food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that met@@ a would probably disappear within a decade .
met@@ a declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of met@@ a with Mr Dou@@ glass joined Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ GA@@ S &apos;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Retail , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt at the same time on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to compare sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week and to provide I@@ GA retailers with fast growing fresh food and deliver a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and relo@@ cation programs to El@@ an are expected and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism of his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ os and deserves praise according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly more praise than criticism for his own behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s not@@ orious confrontation with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison saying , &quot; Wa@@ y@@ in@@ ka would have hit Kyr@@ gy@@ os , and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a Kra@@ mp@@ f caught a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m rather en@@ vy about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the argument a little , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player who broke a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z on the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we wish the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick made a very quick ascent to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have made , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary explains the emergency stand and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illegal in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulating in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted ser@@ bian officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but fru@@ stration rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some had returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would return while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days there must be talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc at a con@@ ten@@ tious meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would record another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put hopes on a bal@@ la@@ sty action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency shel@@ tered on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along his border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after having stopped a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the entry point into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come up by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of commit@@ ting off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are going to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to manipul@@ ate the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton hal@@ ved ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains her face to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced to be candidate for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election .
more than five months before the first elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more constant in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton has a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support in men has decreased significantly , and S@@ anders only return with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
Clinton , however , has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin at the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election nation@@ ally say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are stronger with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - just about a quarter would support it enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate is the most common answer that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become a president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters are also mentioned by Clinton &apos;s supporters ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the vot@@ ability are also cited .
as the vice president th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked of the elections who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders raises himself from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important with a candidate , demo@@ cra@@ cies call questions about the choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters is unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics of voters in their party &apos;s pre @-@ elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den best deals with the three candidates with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it .
democratic voters of the pres@@ election generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as foreign minister continue to be placed , most demo@@ cra@@ cies in the election are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of the Americans are unhappy with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsen@@ ed .
it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , 55 per cent of the voting rights nation@@ ally also see Tr@@ ump as un@@ tru@@ thful and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good notes on leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best suited to hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son many don &apos;t think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close to Donald Tr@@ ump on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is located close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times
in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support is eliminated in the new survey , and others are losing dramatically .
republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers throughout the country . the support increases from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the pol@@ l from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among republi@@ can elec@@ tors with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at 6 % on the third place .
the bug margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week shows that Car@@ son climbs in the poll@@ s - he ends with 19 % support for the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view of a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for asking Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump the last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , for bathing tourists already a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to find warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short treat at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a mysterious ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder attacks were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and was repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , said forem@@ an Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members of the Brotherhood started hiding and presented the welfare of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said forem@@ an Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ ig@@ h with mu@@ te force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder of the third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of terrorist attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also bring it to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increase in interest comes , and the house will fall into fuel , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides little guidance on the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
therefore representatives of the US Central Bank have so heavily stressed that investors should not focus on raising interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that the whole fuss was possibly exagger@@ ated due to an increase in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , interest increases can make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not as dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets will be withdrawn from 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study to what happens after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market is mostly up@@ trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , Head of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ den@@ cial later occurs in the increase cycle and the return thus begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession .
it is very remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , only twice the nominal GDP has been under 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few anticipate that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants held a net interest rate throughout the year , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all vibration cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and placed before rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the fixed income was also volatile as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause ren@@ ders to move closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often result in better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
what is interesting is Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is flat , credit lines have increased and volati@@ lity has increased - all the market features when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt are getting worse because a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also finance their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt becomes a major problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest are most likely to lose , Gold@@ man said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside the pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives member of Parliament critic@@ ised the channel because of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that she only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , claims a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly no longer distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC General Director rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , finding new music and giving new works on order , I really think it &apos;s important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder was needed to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that was under fire during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for it under fire to tread the commercial rival on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to find &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if it was the next time a series of entertainment started . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to issue money from the fee @-@ chan@@ gers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed the issues
for over a decade , virtual shopping has been dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
yet experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase over the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developing over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sale index of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phone purchases .
it meant more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that happens , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers went around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites fell off .
experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers fought for bar@@ gain , could stop buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spending money was spent more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in downtown cities .
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group on the load
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane r@@ ushed
hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the ones killed when a crane m@@ ashed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the way to pay their respect , when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building ran through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell onto the bed .
the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king handed over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that left a san@@ ction to 3@@ 94 .
the bodies of 29 men who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual h@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the h@@ add@@ ling will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said , the Bin Laden group would not have stopped the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which r@@ ushed into an inner courtyard of the large @-@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the h@@ add@@ ling , who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the Kran@@ s , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s large @-@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a de@@ bit@@ ant son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is necessary at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay hospit@@ alized .
government officials ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the relatives of the killed are to be paid and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded will receive half of this amount .

it is said that Br@@ its put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their home .
if you can deal with a hammer or brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British are increasingly employing tra@@ des@@ people to carry out do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services to low prices is now over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must shift this more strongly to a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British company in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group owed the costs for closing the stores .
because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , who owns Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday at the Landes@@ gericht K@@ lagen@@ furt two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball player A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and abor@@ tion .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he was legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the defend@@ ants had cryst@@ alli@@ sed in the preliminary investigation that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 used mon@@ ies of club accounts that they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also accused of financial failure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
the defence was the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity that at no time an asset had ar@@ isen .
the sports officials had only compens@@ ed for expense allowance and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( RD . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ profession of large @-@ scale firm of the financial centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there must be no debts .
in case of appropriate financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the expense allowance has been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , as from 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
for this reason , the former Ob@@ server also seemed to be able to explain the processes .
the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ oni@@ als shared the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant .
the judge asked why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not interest itself in detail for the financial sector , it is important to have been only the freedom of debt , such as the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a functional investigation started in 2011 for official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were appropri@@ ations , declared the defend@@ ants .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know any answer for a long time .
then he said , he thought that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put into the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary was justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensation claim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with him you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he merely calcul@@ ates mile@@ age and di@@ eting .
he added 1.000 Euro per month to the club , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants could not show exact documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an audit in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also referred to o@@ dom@@ eter .
all the de@@ port@@ ations were made in cash , for that he had to drive from his home town of international market to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard st@@ acks further 30,000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction that has been running for three years , Compu@@ terri@@ ese will be able to disman@@ tle further jobs during the company &apos;s split@@ ting up .
the positions of the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ esen H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 places in its corporate customer division .
as a result , costs in the amount of 2.@@ 7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special burden of around EUR 2.7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter .
the 5@@ 5.000 jobs that have been running for three years have not yet been completed .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP still employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share was 2.3 percent .
based on the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto group sp@@ li@@ ts itself : this is how the computer and printing business will be bund@@ led in a new society - apart from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again disap@@ pointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand of corporate customers after its services were the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to latest Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the shipments of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
this resulted in revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responded with a split and massive positions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more business online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans include a total of 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority support anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mainly face rejection : 54 percent expressed their consent ; 35 percent were agreed .
the fact that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria find 61 percent positive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in cooperation with the Syrian government Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents refuse , 20 percent would be for it .
29 per cent did not decide .
car : second press day at 6@@ 6th IA@@ A
at the centre of the fair stand up to 27 September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Connec@@ ting mobility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide audience can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .
the organizers of the V@@ DA car association expect approximately 900 000 visitors two years ago .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion at Serbian Hungarian border
the Hungarian police were deployed at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and floo@@ d@@ lights against several hundred refugees .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind the police , a police line had formed and behind the police officers stood up .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially used pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
after that , the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn somewhat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other refugees congreg@@ ated in themselves and suffered under short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. bank@@ note
the world is watching when the US staff comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether for the first time , interest has been raised for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned about Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , which was last week of view that the F@@ ed will do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will keep .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest put interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Senior Assistant at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the indications suggest that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death Protection at the Delta State University left sorry
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleagues , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; with the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it impossible , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen cir@@ cled him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she was married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police arrested him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a doc@@ torate in spring 2015 from the Delta State University , like his life @-@ law on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their luck charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also allegedly tried to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1000 managers worldwide will cost the work@@ station .
there are , however , new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap mort@@ g@@ ages of Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be a board member for the passenger business .
the Eu@@ row@@ ings low @-@ cost airline should be developed as independent as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the executive team of chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
with the new creation , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike .
this divided the union .
the subject of the talks should be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will come as soon as possible to yield results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the interim supply of the pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa sees routes to the company &apos;s own bil@@ low line Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Morgen@@ zug in the South &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; paintings by Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger are shown in the Künstler@@ haus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Finn@@ in , based in Göttingen , has put together a selection of ti@@ ght@@ less work for the White Hall of the House , which anim@@ ates its viewers to embar@@ k on a journey .
Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left foreign def@@ enders to cry and exclude him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w burned into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fac@@ tur , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a red card and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my way to recovery now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the United Kingdom Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball which was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched it &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided to see the environmental fa@@ bel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the action of the book , instead re@@ stores a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
as if this is not yet susp@@ icious : the text presented by Cameron is partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , is rav@@ aged by the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ering , sn@@ app@@ y being , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read the Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row in a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral bure@@ au .
Super@@ camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the Ka@@ der who chose England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not exclude a down@@ tro@@ phy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack .
message @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th from England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , because - and I have said this - players are their own best voters .
long ago , the run of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England initially deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I set high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which we met very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to make mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra sp@@ in @-@ bowl and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious ring of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no great number of backup spi@@ ders who lift their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful bet to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously mentioned .
the team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but coaches and team actors do not specify the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain from the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ u if the economy is going to be in a loud voice by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ announced ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU will be deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ently dis@@ sec@@ ts itself for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at fre@@ und recently said that some member states are so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises as the EU is now and not always from their own fault , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they mostly do not want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as for the exagger@@ ated long exec@@ utions like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist .
it is difficult to imagine that they will get a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers might even intentionally not plan helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankruptcy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain won &apos;t win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press line , as they did during the refer@@ end@@ ums inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists , who made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU straight ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were with all his cra@@ ck@@ ness .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ chi@@ pping foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our large newspapers .
in fact Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noted that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press never denied it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to waste me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and now .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ b@@ án &apos;s official position on Europe is - I just press it in a friendly way - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people out of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wil@@ der realms of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ev@@ ism can certainly say yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fighting in him did not admit that Cor@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touch @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free card for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ án &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ess economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities for NATO - Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try in all a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US has already been quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called itself .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health Report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with ties to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed verification of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) in order to lead their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director was supposed to have received British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting told him to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes producer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports from tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco line of P@@ he also took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ge@@ ologically marked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products with most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were premature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J claims have already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows , and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by making sure that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ man , says former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ on and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to do the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC gave or sends programs that would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think medium or long @-@ term for a good idea , you should at least give your production to programs that others do not do or put on commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve as broad support as possible for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ on is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
I want to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t lecture in Edinburgh suggested that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ on .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they go on their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sk@@ ate programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you think all , we all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who have a lot of money for the £ 150 , wonder if that &apos;s right because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ thi@@ an mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they were supposed to change , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain themselves on public television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial channels Alli@@ ances enter to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have cultivated worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they have reson@@ ated with sound impulses , which have too high frequencies for human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
nem@@ ato@@ des usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report of Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when he uses ultrasound on the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light emit@@ ted by an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily prone to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , and he added .

according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists are becoming more critical and attempt to bring political work to the public outside of galleries .
many artists engage with activists in protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society .

V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the fire@@ works - through a legend of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , I moved to a student resi@@ dency as self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance into student resi@@ dences ranges from slightly nerve @-@ stirring up to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sh@@ out : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken sab@@ bath , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re honestly said Mar@@ mite does not love or hate , because seriously , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people that you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were burning fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people go .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and put on their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert has received a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friend@@ ships close by baking .
since you start the university at the climax of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to present yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade goo@@ dies is a good way to close friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you tap .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the milk @-@ owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it in a more balanced way than my room@@ mate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people who sit in the glass house .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours if they had something to make it a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had an examination in the morning .
they re@@ acted with more lu@@ ke@@ warm music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally drag into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be ab@@ rup@@ tly embarrass@@ ing if you have a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , ran@@ som to her , separate herself and then see her every day and perhaps experience how she sur@@ passes all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot co @-@ inhabit@@ ant is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your lower abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys left in his not locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good punch is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give you a valuable and am@@ using lesson through security - but never fail someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys into a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , Ger@@ ing@@ men
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need residential space , but also the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ men alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build and build well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thousands of refugees are being pushed to the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes how quickly affordable living space can be created : he builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain in a large part here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the light of the stream of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey town@@ house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs a lot of space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when you enter@@ tain people in residential blocks .
each of the six houses built right in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily reconstructed according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have legally established my project .
it always makes the lo@@ oming Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch regulation .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not right .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but we built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single @-@ educ@@ ating mother or the poor @-@ servant .
I show how to build and build even today .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message that tells the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght is going back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may result in dropping apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the mer@@ ging of the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may turn off half way and this could lead to a break @-@ off of the updates .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
in the fight for the World Cup title N@@ ico Ros@@ berg , in Formula 1 , against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton only knows a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second pointed out before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races so far and took the Fl@@ ut@@ light Grand Prix in the city @-@ state as a favorite in attack .
2009 and last year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Br@@ ite was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Schach@@ club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to his ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess player and tennis player , who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to the cure .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation that President Alfred Klein accepted .
this makes it possible to record players that cannot raise the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the Schach@@ club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town is seen .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Anton@@ isti@@ ft Alten@@ zentrum have joined together under the social foundation &apos;s man@@ tle and opened a new stop at Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consulting , you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more specifically , count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened .
right next to the shopping market , senior citizens and counsel@@ ors will receive information on questions such as nursing care or health care services .
for years we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often nur@@ turing relatives are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though the complexity of insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new house in Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ci@@ tizen Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physio@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other ideally .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre shows both business leaders particularly in the demographic change .
this necess@@ it@@ ates a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedicated itself to the sam@@ ung at age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular associate . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar surroundings as possible .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and Saturday from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang died 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5th September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus shared on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was called the Foreign Office .
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the treas@@ ury in Vienna Hof@@ burg and the conversion of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz to the Austrian Theatre Museum .

ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese was un@@ noticed in Bremen .
foot@@ ball@@ ers once , meanwhile , is Tim Wiese , ex @-@ Nation@@ alt@@ or@@ hü@@ ter in Germany and at Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
intellectu@@ ally , however , he did not admit it .
a meadow in Bremen &apos;s inner city had just cut the hair when he saw a parking space guard standing outside for his white Chevrolet Cam@@ aro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper reported it to the public , offen@@ ded the be@@ amer , and threw down the fine fine of the feet as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one confirms the alle@@ gations at the city of Bremen , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I will decide whether a meadow will be displayed , or not .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft @-@ petrol station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men shou@@ ted to the young boy and struck him with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ leg and bleeding strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first left his victim .
from his friends , the injured young man was now brought home .
the perpet@@ rator followed the group with a car up to the apartment and passed demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male person .
under the aid of a head@@ stock , one compla@@ ined to the face and the th@@ ig@@ h of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care .
up to now there is only one vag@@ ue object description .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 m tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and sen@@ ders to sign up under the telephone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
furthermore , the joint @-@ community mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are absent : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen reti@@ res , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first glance , when the Fel@@ lowship , years ago , met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who is currently completing her medical education in the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just ph@@ oned them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of doing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; clos@@ eness and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with practice .
however , they continue to stay in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller was born there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several doctors &quot; practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed the leading emergency doctor in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a house doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 50,000 Euros will be given to the mil@@ ler as part of a funding programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Zambia mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come into practice in the field of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another GP practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
if no successor would have found , it would have gone .
who visits Müll@@ ers speaking hour , also still looks in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the field standing .
with their farewell to A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long period of time , she felt a little sorrow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself from gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and loves to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also carried out at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that anyone who wants to submit an asylum claim can do this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , not even over the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia is denied &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to leave refugees arriving in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled by the Schengen area .
as the minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to not seal its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill up its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government shared , the first refugees had already tried to travel in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police cars were constantly meeting with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
in the coming days his country with around 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , harmon@@ izing Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was the people to adopt certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made it , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually mean that the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ west route has already been predicted by observers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously pointed out that his country has prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently made a good testimony to the country , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Wednesday morning , the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic still tried to calm down the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be very high refugee figures at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still not cleared mine fields 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers was sent to the border region .

Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have listened to a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who have been accused of having gained an insight into even un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the exploited information , insi@@ der shops are said to have been made in the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the investig@@ ators were given a total of more than 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 further accused in the event continued to di@@ gest .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are to have acted both in the U.S. and Eastern Europe .

urban railways stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; pul@@ s@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four big plates each with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ apper is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions such as the volunteers .
while man@@ ch interven@@ es spontaneously to chal@@ k and read the sentence &quot; my life be@@ j@@ ah@@ en , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the fr@@ inge of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with the dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that for me at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Mannheim Di@@ ak@@ onic work , which is working together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public effective action is good for 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to share on the boards publicly , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the topic of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the Hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped to open up people .

when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was seeking honorary officials , she immediately reported and was involved in the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see the life of another war@@ te , keep it precious and treasure the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its profit prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ sourcing service .
the company also said that she plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period .
the share fell more than 2.5 percent in the market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said a gain between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year that ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower outlook comes in spite of the price increases , which are an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ ans of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid yields if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for the holiday occupation were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the analysts predicted twelve of Z@@ ack &apos;s Investment Research analysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks surv@@ eyed analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipment to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales of bo@@ d@@ goods increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the market trade , about one hour before opening , F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most expected conference in the year Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to lift the body for the first time for almost a decade .
lo@@ oming over them at an end of the ornam@@ ented , two @-@ storey meeting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the near @-@ zero interest rate at the end of 2008 .
although most of the data in the economy show that it is solid , recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make the most cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal government bonds - and be it just a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , head econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently surv@@ eyed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average increased by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she must go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would calm the financial markets , because they would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
still a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , it would be necessary that more economic progress would be needed to increase the sentence .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed envis@@ ages as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average was more than 16 % below its peak in May , when investors feared that slow@@ ing of the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered in this month , whereas the Dow now stands by almost 10 % below the pole of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is neither the main concern of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included technically in its decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close their monetary expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caused confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere but also consult other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that seem to not be associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ated for an increase in interest , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to lower its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Lack@@ ner said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives cancelled these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability in the first place during a severe crisis just as the market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
to give you a warm welcome does not work without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher of body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 l@@ ences .
every Thursday they are doing it at the asylum seekers home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite different than at the right school .
Brazilian Pap@@ al Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women on how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that su@@ ck to breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by approximately 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat@@ ter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited rever@@ ber@@ ation of the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds are moving step by step : in the recent council meeting , the completed construction application was unanim@@ ously f@@ lown up without major discussions .
previously , among other things , the Board decided on an application for a construction legal &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ ry first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was about the ti@@ lt that was prescribed for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan - should lie below 10 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the ti@@ lt was not allowed to be &quot; exceptions &quot; - with the Bern@@ ese community generally more restric@@ tive during liber@@ ating orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is no recur@@ rent project in the gym@@ nasi@@ um construction : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are estimated at around 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected from school and lati@@ tude transport .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will now be presented to the Board of Directors for the examination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg will be closed earlier than planned - 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this is the Supervisory Board , and the meeting on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , all of the almost 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the remaining inside station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the staff were informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in every case an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree to both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ appe , which has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , if the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board , joined rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Federal Council , will be used as a shelter for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what I conclude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day@@ was@@ sych@@ iat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief physician for more than 30 years have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened again over the past few decades , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions is required tonight at the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) .
the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga is indeed the clear favorite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce .

Jag@@ ath case with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( County Wit@@ tenberg ) several hunters were in use as the police shared .
after a shot the 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear .
the Krimin@@ al@@ poli@@ zei ( Criminal Police ) determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a breach of violence since Saturday .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ utor and police shared on Wednesday .
as a suspect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday night was also considered to be indic@@ ted and the investig@@ ators led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman the investig@@ ators first encountered personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ rator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , according to the authorities , the police interro@@ gated the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the dead in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the further investigations are to be carried out on the closer circum@@ stance of the act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gaps
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are looking for an affordable housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution battles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the Association Agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : in Germany , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished this year .
thus , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the rented apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers have been living in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising refugee numbers .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is shooting a deficit of housing , which is growing from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , some 77@@ 0.000 residential units were missing in the metro@@ politan areas , compla@@ ined Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason , many professionals were living in large cities in need of accommodation in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the fi@@ erc@@ eness in the apartment market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has decreased for the first time .
in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost the social housing construction again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would wai@@ ve the basic income tax and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats are temporarily suspended .
in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for refugee housing of the German state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros already more than half of the available around 300 million euros had been retri@@ eved .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia align corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary is practically no longer a transit , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces its passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian interior minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach Western Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television channel RT@@ L reports .
Hungary sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws , which came into effect on the same day , are also practically superf@@ lu@@ ous in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the neighbouring country of Croatia .
most stem@@ med media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they had tried to walk on foot across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter border f@@ ences .
for this , the border stre@@ ak has other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before the gate closure on Monday it was 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws show the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted threatened prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Tran@@ sit zones &quot; established on the border , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically no one has any prospect of granting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barrier grids were disman@@ tled and one of the recording managers in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the purpose of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
about 20,000 migrants were still in the country , but still in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday , when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Passa@@ u by train .
because Germany had surprisingly set the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the stream of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and caught the stu@@ ds along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we did not even scra@@ m@@ ble the expected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we have said immediately , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers were moved to a regional train in W@@ els from an ICE train in a regional train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in order to make it to Germany after the short @-@ term announcement that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still to try the border .
the regional train was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest joined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , on Sundays , a two @-@ day @-@ run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further Z@@ ig@@ s to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to establish structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor is highly officially and publicly att@@ un@@ ed to the position of the Hungarian government in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ st@@ kreis der National@@ socialism &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees must also find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , in view of the ongoing surge of refugees and the approaching winter , with us to produce decent states for protective @-@ seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 win@@ try districts
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all the hands full to do with refugee support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to raise quot@@ as for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the initial tak@@ eover centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great fuss , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 neighbour@@ hoods in the he@@ ur@@ igen year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had talks with the provincial capitals .
they would have assured him of creating neighbour@@ hoods for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also puts great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers have to comply with a certain height of the towel rack or the size of the surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad with his experience in contrast to the Interior Ministry in contrast to the Interior Ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one cannot say without further into the face of un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause any cost of the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
so far , his own quest for torture has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees plans the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , because those affected are currently under way without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in case of an emergency , however , further sites should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism exercises the chief of the city on the division of refugees within the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other districts must also contribute to their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a long telephone conversation with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday massac@@ red further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is now also introducing controls on its borders is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is set up , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine investing in the new shi@@ py@@ ard in Star@@ tup firms and later to acquire some of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is pa@@ yed by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the Arctic
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the centre of attention in the new shop .
actually Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old lady from Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , she has now got an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the shop where they sell bags , cases , shoes and appar@@ el of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have been thinking for a long time whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the large @-@ room Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who herself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has placed Br@@ eit from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women in sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , also the expert can not answer with the last safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is used every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a village called An@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this property also connects people with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off @-@ off .
whether it is alien@@ ated from a foreign language , journalists are concerned or knowledge gaps are revealed in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire originate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fris@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the win@@ emaking village on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant place are related to him over -@@ eigh@@ ty corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find this somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt kind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous offspring , to which beside Tr@@ ump also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , so with the statement that it would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the hearts there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already a bit big , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to High German : the en@@ co@@ ders , she says .
Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the An@@ ders .
Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundations of the real estate company were the first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their home in the long run failed in the Bavarian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Geschichte und Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the occasionally marked statements of the follow @-@ up .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the Pol@@ ly , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tr@@ ump ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement considers the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ ushing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ , which was generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t win the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 spectators , even in the USA the interest is awakening .
the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first mountain climbing village .
from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the neighbouring country is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leaders of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the ratings for Today .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise posted an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers across five major cities , compared to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to the sunrise has closed over the past few months .
in August , Today posted an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison with the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 was passed .
in September , Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ .000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for checking !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children at New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , showed an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was full of 7@@ 20,000 .
average Hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the Qu@@ otes of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that didn &apos;t manage to mig@@ rate the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably unknow@@ ingly appear who wins The Bachelor .
the woman at which Sam Wood finally lands in The b@@ achel@@ or was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you might accidentally have given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed up to the final on Thursday
all three women have dealt a ly@@ rical way about why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as a reason why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be their rep@@ lies to the game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies noted , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly att@@ un@@ ed to it , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose if not she , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the b@@ achel@@ or will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank , when he lost a t@@ ang@@ ing as it did the Aus@@ sie ru@@ g@@ by league conversion at his first punch return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his playful catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian suite had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine any worse start in his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut back then in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

free voters call for the setting of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee figures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Chamber in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get gra@@ dations in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survey day by Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian community . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , quite other main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees also domin@@ ates the Free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the c@@ law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , just as it existed during the former Yugoslavia war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria shifts , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the state politics in large @-@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a long lasting combustion engine remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Ministry of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; intermediate level plus &quot; in 47 Gym@@ na@@ sien where an extension of the gym@@ nasi@@ um intermediate level has been tested for three to four years .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want to .
free ride at the G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .
solid Wall Street helps Da@@ x to jump on the jumps
after a long distances , the German stock market has closed a trend @-@ free and nervous trading course with profits .
only in the afternoon was a fir@@ mer opening of the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upwards .
the M@@ DA@@ X mid @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .

solid profits also booked trade places in London and Paris .
in the US , the Dow Jones Index last noted about 1 percent in the plus .
many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect markets to be replaced until after the interest rate decision in the US and also to the large decline in the fut@@ ures on this Friday .
the discussion about the loads from the nuclear phase has meanwhile pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and left deep marks even at E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German energy companies probably lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the top of the Da@@ x .
according to a tra@@ der , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; took effect from the weekend .
accordingly , investors donated too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
in doing so , investments in promising waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August more cars were set off than in the previous year &apos;s period , such as the industry association AC@@ EA at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt .
the papers of the Daimler and BMW issued by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen assets increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market , the return on return of listed federal securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .

4 People killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd , demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , said a be@@ amer on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , senior civil servant , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before she resor@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ ls used , which are known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , apparently produced such a high rate of death .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ho@@ i say that new provinces , formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would l@@ essen their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent clas@@ hes since 10 .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post shall be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but concrete offers are not yet available .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market some 4,000 square meters of property in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
the plan is to use the grounds for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is said by the city .
which investor would come into question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts were concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner of Great Street , already a few months ago , and the building is demoli@@ shed .
project H@@ ieve : details on the table
the plans for a holiday settlement on the Small Sea in Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented public plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure time
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , sal@@ ted , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement are located at the small sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the mid @-@ size Em@@ den company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction that accused investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went into the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fierce reactions among marine owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the hotel structure .
Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea and a member of the Board of Directors at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; that &apos;s going to be a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like some other project critics that the traffic would increase strongly by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole loads coming so that this pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google re@@ starts dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to help raise the $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations because they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / were doubled to 11 million $ .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also fled from war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c flu@@ ff formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same at 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition was completely dissolved and 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes mel@@ lowed completely only at one percent and in some cases with only about two percent .
in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in a@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the guiding researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rek@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people undergoing obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have attached their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is currently being observed in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ attractive at school times , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is especially interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot absorb all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is ad@@ mira@@ ble to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the USA moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase in intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
poison control centers in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swal@@ lowed strongly alcoholic non @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , so Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of income of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 were reported to report the poison control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children would intentionally drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mutation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly in small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison emergency centre at the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ infection in reach of children , and when children come from it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry fragrance disinf@@ ect@@ ants at school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her in the Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ ted her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl fell by the alcohol and had pushed his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ecting clo@@ ths and to store hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario after swal@@ lowing the disinf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active substance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher by using anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the missed plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and re@@ proved disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
when a collision event occurs , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car is easily injured during a collision accident .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross@@ road towards the round@@ about industrial area and was too late that two vehicles ahead were stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck into the rear of an audi@@ tor and checks this vehicle on a Ford Fi@@ esta .
in the event of the accident involved , there was a loss of damage of about 10,000 euros , divided the police .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready and had to be tow@@ ed .

Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths play Ger@@ ede about Dis@@ harmon@@ ie
there are rum@@ ors about disc@@ ord at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneous . he insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re under pressure , I think the players look forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there aren &apos;t just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following ex@@ cre@@ tion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now has five points ahead of the table , clearly stood at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly - but we must go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better .
getting together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously at January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , he pointed out that he hur@@ ried several January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about the signing of new entran@@ ces and insi@@ sts that he does not want to interfere with the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this high season time to integrate what you &apos;ve seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target person Mich@@ u with reference guide
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a nasty k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les for two years and has not made the departure from Wales this summer .

the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later rev@@ oked - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insisted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no performance commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the management board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but conf@@ esses that the decline in the playing field has to end .
I think that Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen was desperate to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to win a seventh consecutive League victory , giving them a margin of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in po@@ cal@@ ms or le@@ agues , the games of this kind are not won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was about 5.5 percent higher than the figures issued by the National Statistics Bureau ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .
dr@@ unken irrit@@ ated the process

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and since more applications are available as places , a more mak@@ eup lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a bl@@ amed me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have form@@ ulate it better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to enter all details here again .
I can &apos;t say that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after wet police chase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he talked the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang down the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water just a few meters away from a police officer trying to gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were sum@@ mon@@ ed in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards were trying to spy on him and threatened to end race sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobal@@ t t@@ amp@@ er test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long sat on it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head raised and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had made the bomb blast in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call when I am asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to grasp me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the conclusion that it will be personal ?
did the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps blame people outside of trainers for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have built up with the long lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ ands , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees wrong@@ ly applied mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like this yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was also like that on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy returns against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring struggling
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators have allowed the Storm @-@ Players &quot; Ring battles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed remark to the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers on his team gave him a confident voice , because they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ ky a real focus , and that has provided us with the trend revers@@ al .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this happens again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said that he would take care of a divorce .
but now he has a team that can play and which we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you would like to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they can .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co versus Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is it an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses and no points of tension ?
for me it is the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team has free on this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guaran@@ te@@ ed for Dru@@ gs
a man , possibly a lifel@@ ong sentence , threatened to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ long sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been of a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the final declarations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ oun@@ ds his Australian and his Serbian passport , reported to the police a day and stops at an exit block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had stopped in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to devi@@ ate from the left to the left , as the police told him .
the driver &apos;s cab driver &apos;s cab was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 pm .
there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to attract pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the ma@@ iden &apos;s phone when she was asleep , log@@ inn@@ ed into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the be@@ wil@@ dering news and instantly al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police looked around and saw the five images , then analyzed the computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching on the computer was carried out by him , but said that it was happening because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce her .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone , she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty of having taken up in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year to have viol@@ ated the requirements on 25 January and did not appear before court at a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence counsel Gregor S@@ im asked Ho@@ gg to not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , because one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no up@@ lifting sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in his decline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael sp@@ ends the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case , Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit , but was held in custody on other cases due to hear@@ ings .
he was admitted before the date of judgment into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
slu@@ dges switch to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up outside the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many bad users caused fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly on smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said .
along the border river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the coun@@ ties of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and dam@@ s to the German side .
there they are taken in reception by federal police and for@@ warded to the registration .
in comparison to the weekly start on Wednesday , the Munich main station met again clearly more refugees .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone up to 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokesman said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : descend@@ ant of the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , divided the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was dra@@ gged over the Atlantic over the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected above all in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Con@@ stance with bows from 60 to 90 mph .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the mass makes it : every two years , the car makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , it is mainly moving to the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : approximately 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is reflected at the IA@@ A ( Audi@@ ence stage 17 to 27 September ) .
a lot of new compact models will be presented in this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the largest premi@@ eres for the German car sector is the Opel Astra , which will stand at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Rüssel@@ sheim . Opel is facing the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers additional diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines will be counted for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is only five @-@ door Astra .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IA@@ A .
and what will happen next to the Astra on the IA@@ A for a new compact car ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a stressed sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan boom wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications with 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is shown at the IA@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hands on the front part : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time with Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the upgraded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel prison quarters who had been housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners generally claim financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the judges can even hope for money if they were locked only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
with this , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful in Karlsruhe with his constitutional complaint : he was housed in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man , who is now on the free foot according to his lawyer , had been transferred to a larger cell .
his arrest warrant , due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land of Berlin , failed .
however , the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s human being hurt .
Kammer@@ gericht will now decide on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of arrest for the compensation were decisive , a compensation claim was given , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear a bri@@ ghter of the person &apos;s legal protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of imprisonment .
thus they only spoke in April to a prisoner of damage because he was locked naked in a cell .
according to a decision from 2011 , it is estimated that the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed a decent housing for a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a homo@@ geneous cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the pris@@ ons in Berlin were in the head@@ lines in recent weeks due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to but@@ chers it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Press Office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to junior lack , 19 shall fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what happens in Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to various progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments every year - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all in affordable rental objects : every year , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing benefits from rental prices , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing would have to be created per year and the Con@@ federation would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in agreement , scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in Germany over the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find jobs in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says Mig@@ ration@@ alist Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work .
while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as residence requirement that limits asylum seekers to a residential area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - a majority of the points of view prevailed that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market more quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lack of German knowledge .
so far there is still no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore based on the view from Thr@@ än@@ hardt the Königs@@ weg to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents , it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ eln@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators is increasing by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity by allowing more professional schools .
in the countries , students without German knowledge will be prepared for classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have qualifications in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ acker from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum seekers could be facilit@@ ated by access to the higher education institution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ dung do not receive any services after the asylum application law if they start a study .
the latter basically do not receive a b@@ ill@@ board , since they do not fall under the circle of the people of the b@@ af@@ ici@@ ans .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ o@@ g , from January 1 , 2016 to shor@@ ten this span to 15 months .
but this gap must be closed , however , for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually put the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ to @-@ church law to further develop a new state @-@ religion relationship .
the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers , would also be important .
the rights are also duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give him some control options .
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to escape such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will be a topic of the whole society in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more urgent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a universal equality law since a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored by the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and stakeholders of non @-@ white German have long been calling for and what international agreements like anti @-@ rac@@ ist prevention Germany commit must become a reality in the coming years , if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says MEP Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be incorporated into the system for this purpose .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards immediately after registration .
services rendered could later be accounted for by the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to send as many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seekers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; law of asylum &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , the doctors make it possible to create language barriers .
so far , the Berlin Health Scienti@@ st The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more poorly informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ters need to be taken over , it demands .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical points in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
among refugee children , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and for the young people it is about HIV @-@ education .
with some of the other illnesses , German doctors come from her training , but it is clear that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; even relief in sight is possible by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , several refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly disc@@ ard ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill based on estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therapy Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
particularly vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for a psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , however , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social welfare offices , mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether or not a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new staging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst interven@@ es in the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst in the Man@@ ege on the brick , was@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Tibetan and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management of managers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for enthusiasts lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their everyday lives and take them in a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white cocktail with cosmop@@ olitan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3@@ 000@@ km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus program convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family will captiv@@ ate the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of mu@@ te films , the Cuban duo wants to easily take up .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to capture women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
apart from numerous salmon farms , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst is also fascinated by intuition and arti@@ san@@ ity .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascinated with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a matter of different animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t go well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each match unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read by the eyes of each wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
so the top command means : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together in one enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst said : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites its performances from 17 to 20 September every day from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is the family day , for the show at 5 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s el@@ dest leader , dropped down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by statements by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ inger .
last month , they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesman for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the Parliament members that the immunity in the Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave Parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the boss said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers of politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deeper portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before , in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; said the company .
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this area , which is based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the associated danger of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd records 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere diseases since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 that have recorded most of the injury days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career that he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to continue by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign has been launched last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where the Richter scale was measured 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the association to his first European triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
it has never worked at Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I have long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even more desperate than ever before , how suicide rate among young men on a 15 year pole prove .
in 2013 it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign Against a miserable life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not depres@@ sive , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication @-@ led communication , with its emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health far more deeply .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
every character was not defined by his work but by his personality , which g@@ lowed through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football gu@@ esses in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case , even if they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a colleague of telephone care , I explained to myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and end@@ anger is clearly shown to me how even the smallest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ancient phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to crush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and S@@ haft Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it does not only strive for the qualification for the K.@@ O. rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . later he was replaced with his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he started his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perfect over the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which last weekend could hold 2 : 2 Un@@ decided at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was described as the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why , when he went in to Marco Ver@@ rat@@ a Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed on Johan Wil@@ and over to the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who suggested Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field lined up a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps posts in the 3@@ 4th minute they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes arose , with some mis@@ carri@@ ages and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was p@@ atz@@ t alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , turning Di Maria into a shooting , which was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans achieved his sixth season gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ de from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could be low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi found a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Glen@@ core ga@@ thers $ 2.5 billion through sale of shares
the mining giant Glen@@ core , based in Switzerland , who is affected by single @-@ cut raw material prices , collected 2.5 billion $ by a stock sale as part of its huge debt plan .
the company Glen@@ core registered in London said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling raw material prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning .
the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Glen@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to re@@ pay around one @-@ third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by around half , coal , copper and other raw materials prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President X@@ is &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi meet a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber @-@ pion@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South Chinese sea .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented change from FC Bayern 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the Bayern Bayern was obviously just a few years ahead of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion league winner , two times club champion , twice European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to Qatar for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now tells us he was standing before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we did nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time would have run in 2008 / 2009 with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , folded the Red aus ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph in the end .
Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she didn &apos;t need behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives , emphasized in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian were strengthened .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers of producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te , who is beaten by her white col@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People sat for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the only black person in the room so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved national effect and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured backing .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still weaker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be viewed as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is not clear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
the competition @-@ show , which just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
the last task was to climb a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still under shock over the winning of the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the fin@@ als and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he swe@@ ars any res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for a mixed season , the filming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
earlier they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb within a half @-@ season of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two sessions , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and so I want to go into the game very concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ lator Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle mar@@ in@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung his sleep well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , clearly better off in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the 7th Inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ te , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the right @-@ wing Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end run in the second , Ver@@ hagen introduced the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double play
after Detroit added an insurance @-@ run at the end of the ninth session , the Wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
at the beginning of the game , Detroit prof@@ ited from a still not mov@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two in@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been cancelled in front of the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started to get started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch as in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes delivered a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game that made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor .
he did not particularly well beat , but he caught the right position .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J@@ .A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three hits with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was eliminated due to a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list , is scheduled to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP turns Daniel Morris from the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was bought in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been ste@@ aling on the right hip joint since August 20 .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people arriving in it will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden shared on Tuesday evening .
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily suspended .
they are then to be distributed to other communities .
in the past ten days , according to the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium of Gie@@ ßen , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse had arrived in H@@ esse .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Isch@@ inger : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German military measures in Syria an option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he threw the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective path &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the cup had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict arises in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Austrian interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , and no one will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concrete figures did not call it and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees came across the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann asked for a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection will complain this too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a pencil view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view was strongly shared in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge force exer@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia in the night on Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to tie down the border with Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers looking for ev@@ asive routes across Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands of further migrants reported on the way to the Greek border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the polar bear of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sp@@ lashes out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what researchers conclude from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the moon stag@@ gers slightly on its path around the ring plane .
although this movement is only small , but still too large for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
for a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes in the Satur@@ n@@ Moon South Pole in 2006 , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and feed the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama for about one month .
an examination has resulted in an aut@@ op@@ sy injury at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , divided the association with .
R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich @-@ based lions , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably means four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a serious loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think about it now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a non @-@ united professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but if you want to pay attention to its slim line , it is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support ey@@ es@@ ight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ go should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly .
the colour of the shell alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives a special note to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first F@@ ail@@ storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland shared on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ al valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning a distinctive cold front crosses us , which brings strong rain@@ falls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the side of the mountain you will break through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows on Thursday morning to the F@@ öhn@@ valleys with arches from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partially also with over 100 km / h .
the hair dryer can reach the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and in some places , and even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wedn@@ es@@ days stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer@@ y temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture starts to st@@ ow at the surface of the mountain .
here &apos;s the rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , South of the Alps must be accounted for in the next 48 hours with partially more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , this after great rain amounts have already fallen over the last few days .
on Thursday morning the air dri@@ es out , as a result , a cold front rolls with a powerful , partly swe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind fresh@@ ens strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures go far back .
the following days are present in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , but in the south it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Reform@@ ator on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now known as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could only live in secret their faith for centuries as a minority .
with the square , it becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city then as a disgu@@ sting sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions are likely to have encouraged him by historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the Oc@@ ci@@ dent Church with his thesis against the aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updates Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 designs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is not at all syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles which focus on themes such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood .
he was immediately fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into contemporary contex@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation from Martin Luther and each one set by the artist who formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to be able to wear my dad again and again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second aim is to bring art to more importance in the shortest time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today marked by advertising , and that is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbo@@ lis@@ m is displaced .
artists have a different lust and delight to show things .
images always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; capture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images , let them appear , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture looks for his counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t care to fully grasp the Bible , but also chosen mysterious themes for him .
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of the Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15 .
start of construction for BM@@ X rail
plans were made , place found , company commissioned , Erd@@ hü@@ gel model@@ ed for a circuit : a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X rail was already finished .
failure in politics and administration resulted in dr@@ uss , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
thus , hill de@@ ported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will take place in October , the first joint venture Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to share in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees from 2019 to 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga places a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football re@@ acts to the soli@@ di@@ fying situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policy its help in cop@@ ing with the pending problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can be no one in principle , that doesn &apos;t bother me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the state minister Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and may help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the crucial course has to put the policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football League therefore has extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; said K@@ id@@ s@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A session in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal lists also support this program .
as early as this weekend , the 36 professional clubs are showing a clear sign when they will wear the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports chief Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is going on every day , nobody is allowed to see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can help football feder@@ alists , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent character of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this Friday , the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale on this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ id@@ s@@ bach called for the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements in their locations had started their own projects is great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous significance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government provides 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported K@@ id@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP Board of Directors loses an eye on accident
the Board of Directors of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye for several reports by a fall in early July .
during the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he had fallen to a water @-@ glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , fain@@ ted , then dra@@ gged himself out of the street - that he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully operational &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again if you please . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

constitutional Complaints ( BvR ) ( Number of result : 2 )
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus have finally sm@@ ashed in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the football league in the Du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga Top Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only alter its root position on the R@@ eus position .
thus he announced a change to the goal keeper position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place from the tribe of Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is training at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soccer teacher praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether fashion f@@ eller is used in the future in all European league games , however , Tu@@ ck@@ les left open .
with a high probability , he will also be able to contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ ter statement by Mit@@ player R@@ eus that the final draw for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead a pioneering role in Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of cars .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the br@@ ink of the Auto Show IA@@ A of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio communication .
a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to make use of internationally that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only sees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways is technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but still vehicles on public roads are expected to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans are still scep@@ tical about the Germans - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of Prü@@ for@@ gan@@ ization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not count at all in 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed account for up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the United States 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , however , the traffic in flowing traffic could still be 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car control under no circumstances .

the final decision shall be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term arranged sponsor min in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the disadvantage is , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Individu@@ al @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who introduces the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the designer has changed his initially lo@@ aning attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort has been done : to fr@@ oth the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list has been hired for example .
14 tons of material have bar@@ red the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather trousers out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , agile fashion temp@@ tations of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and badly in football ) he dressed his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the throwing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought it , but of course .
he didn &apos;t have to pay the models for his first own fashion show .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as fashion niche
earlier it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they used for example for ceilings and she@@ ers .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ Pa .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace fashion , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories like bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past bull po@@ ets , is an increasing order potential .
anyone who uses no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ stly P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace and embroi@@ dery industry association with nine other companies .
only they can carry the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales were broken away .
private specialist shops and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass @-@ goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
moreover , exports , currently to Russia and the US , are also weak@@ ening .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer of the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year , we have launched a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger Landes@@ enst@@ elle der West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that have to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why an existing design often only varies slightly in order to keep a customer base .
a couple of years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ visited the historic Schne@@ eb@@ all@@ spitze .
the machine sticks to small spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mith master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that I could not start anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of P@@ lau@@ ener tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who would like to have a souvenir .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends are not to be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , it is not about a new movie but a kind of continuation that takes 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director says : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI push@@ es to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy has to open up to the outside to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group engaged in steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should aim to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Board for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to promote new spin and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Xi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is tested and tested by test programs .
the initiative is of importance as it points to the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , safegu@@ arding a right @-@ wing business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also stated that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy vis @-@ à @-@ vis foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also took part in Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double the mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to treat consumers with a significantly higher dose of the neur@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper of the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and small children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as sh@@ arks and s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large predat@@ ory fish are so strongly poll@@ uted today with mercury that on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ vo@@ cable .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU according to F@@ ood@@ watch wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries such as car@@ p usually are so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolfgang sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly po@@ ison@@ ous to humans , which is particularly rich in predat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can be caused especially in un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily caused by the burning of coal into the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants send more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount emit@@ ted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already reported the most common health risks reported in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
