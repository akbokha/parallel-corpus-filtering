a ) This Agreement shall apply to non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community ( in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization is notified that its procedures for the entry into force of this Convention are concluded and
II ) when the Community of the Organisation is notified that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this State for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The Organization , the Community and the States consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties about a change of this Convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The Director General shall immediately inform all Member States of the organization from any change in this Convention .
a ) This convention takes place on the day that the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification that their procedures are concluded for entry into force .
B ) This agreement will remain in force as long as the States Parties to the Treaty are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the part I on securing measures .
the aim of the method of securing measures set out in this Convention is the timely discovery of the diver@@ gence of significant quantities of nuclear power from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear powers for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ rence from such a branch through the risk of early discovery .
for the sub@@ missions of the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , verb@@ ati@@ m with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the verification by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the material quantity , which is not proven for a certain period of time , is specified by speci@@ fying the accuracy limits for the specified dates .
in carrying out their investigations , the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the Community &apos;s security system .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nuclear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their safegu@@ arding measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and Meas@@ ures will make use of the following manner and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are closer and appropriate in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise from the stock removed core material and inventory ;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) method for evaluating accumulation of non @-@ measured hol@@ dings and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and report system which points out the core material inventory for each material balance sheet and the changes in this inventory including the one and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ures for the reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ hal@@ ous material that has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel circulation under letter c ) is introduced into the States , so the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) aband@@ ons core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope rich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or if that core material or other material produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circulation cycle is introduced into the States , so it is subject to the other securing measures described in this Convention .
a ) The safegu@@ arding measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the community considers that the recovery of core material , which is subject to safegu@@ arding measures according to this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable from resi@@ dues , so consult the organization and the community on the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The safegu@@ arding measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community acknowledge that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures according to this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material , when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
( B ) Nuclear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es core materials , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this Convention , from these security measures , provided the entire nuclear material amount liberated by this article is at no point in time as
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of particular p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with en@@ rich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the nature ur@@ anium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of en@@ rich@@ ment ;
( B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with en@@ rich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) Tw@@ enty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if delivered core material is processed or stored together with core materials which are subject to the securing measures according to this Convention , precau@@ tions are taken for the re @-@ application of the securing measures on that material .
the Community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements which , in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective support of the tasks of the organisation according to this Convention , in particular determine how the procedures established in the Convention are applicable .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or altered without alter@@ ing this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the Council between the Organization , the Community and the States .
on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organization sets up a summ@@ ar@@ ised inventory of the whole , the safegu@@ arding measures of this convention in the states , irrespective of its origin , and continues this inventory list due to the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States of Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the international economic cooperation conference in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general res@@ sources of resources .
C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months following the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible issued within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central b@@ ind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table from which it is intended to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -
the organization organis@@ es a special account under the name &quot; Special transaction account , &quot; which states the Member States in accordance with this agreement to the special transactions account ; this account is referred to by the Organization as administrator and used ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; administrator &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transactions account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the Member State , which shall be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state to the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the organization &apos;s deposit in the respective country .
B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , and i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the order within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the appointed time appointed ;
II ) the second at the level of the balance of the agreement on 1 January 1979 , or at a time agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may make payments on request before the aforementioned dates .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about proportional drawings to the cash or the school junk to cover the expenses for the transaction loans and balance the special transactions account in an appropriate manner .
in the granting of this loan , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and predictable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its other lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ counted ; and
VII ) The extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
every transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly convertible development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , irrespective of whether it belongs to the organization &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices , which are considered , approved and administered by means of funding provided by the Organization , with the objective of contributing to this Agreement .
the funds of the special transaction may not be used instead of regular funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which have been approved as part of a loan or credit for a program or project that has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force .
apart from Section 4 , special action loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions , which apply to the development loans granted by the Organization ; they are therefore re@@ payable in ten years of age each in 50 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special transactions are provided in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amounts to pay this bi@@ b must be paid directly to the organization that maintains it .
each transaction loan must be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the source of the funds is specifically stated .
the revenues from each special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are made or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization and who , according to what the administrator has set at the time of the loan granted , may be recipients of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments of special transactions are carried out on the special transactions account , and the amount paid back in this way in the currency of a member state is to be returned as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the administrator holds the E@@ EC on the plans and programs approved by the directors until the complete tender of all special transactions for the E@@ EC .
during the period of re@@ payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator is brief@@ ing the E@@ EC on the development of the special transactions loan and the expenses they have made .
as soon as possible after the end of the organisation &apos;s financial year , the administrator transm@@ its a detailed calculation of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this statement .
after full payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator of the E@@ EC sends a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special transaction bank as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transactions account , which account for the amounts paid to the account and the payments paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are evident .
the E@@ EC and the administrators work closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the bai@@ li@@ ff up to the full issue of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions , and on all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , if the E@@ EC and the Organization were not entered into force , the agreement and all the ensu@@ ing obligations of the parties are due immediately .
if the total amount of capital paid by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the ensu@@ ing obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval from the individual Member States and the E@@ EC according to the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fy the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings in question .
the General Sec@@ retariat passes these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
this agreement will be effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , and each wor@@ ding is equally authentic .
considering that the agreement in the form of a letter to change the An@@ nex A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded , HA@@ T shall issue the following UN@@ DA@@ TION :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this program includes the creation of a large test rig , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Joint Business J@@ ET &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty ( herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Joint Business J@@ ET &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Switzerland has been involved in research work in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well vers@@ ed in the area concerned .
since extensive work has yet to be carried out for the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summ@@ ari@@ ze their relevant efforts in order to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and their respective research work , which has reached a higher priority level due to the energy crisis -
this agreement will enable each contracting party to benefit from the possible benefits provided by mutual research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for mutual research and therefore the common objective of this research , i.e. , by using the controlled core fusion reaction to achieve faster .
in order to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the parties associate their respective research programmes in An@@ nex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programme . &quot;
in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be extended or modified after examination by the institutions mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program .
each time the contracting parties accept a new program , the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II will take place in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 shall be realised by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories that work with Eur@@ atom Programme ;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project .
in view of the association agreement stipul@@ ated in Article 2 , 1 of this agreement , the parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; association agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those concluded between the Commission and the States and companies or persons , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme .
with the same objective Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as the &quot; Agreement on Human Rights Exchange . &quot;
with regard to participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is one of J@@ ET &apos;s Common Business with the date of the entry into force of the present agreement , whose statutes it accepts .
furthermore Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become the contractual partner of any contract , whose goal falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement .
the institutions commissioned with the implementation of the association intended in Article 2 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
the association agreement , in particular , is responsible for setting up a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat .
- to monitor the development of research work and to direct the best possible results achieved in line with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom programme - in the following &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , is taking this task true with regard to all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and direc@@ ts their T * ness in the interests of the two contracting parties to the common goal defined in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme , as well as the common goal defined in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments in the world .
in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG shall appoint one or more Swiss representatives to the advisory groups created within the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are requested .
the advis@@ ors who provide the VG research proposals with regard to the fact that the funds approved for the Eur@@ atom programme provide the best possible scientific results , take this task as regards all research and development work which is referred to in this agreement .
in the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the involved laboratories .
the Committee of Directors , who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and is responsible for the optimal use of the capacity of the laboratories that are involved in the work carried out within the program , mer@@ ges this task with regard to all research and development work that falls under the present agreement .
in particular , it ensures the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss program .
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordin@@ ating committees used within the Eur@@ atom programme .
coordin@@ ating committees with adequate proposals for the best possible use of resources , personnel as well as knowledge and skills concerning the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , apply this task in relation to all research and development work which fall under the present agreement .
the BA@@ F is a responsible representative of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any third country associated with energy research .
at the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F consul@@ ts the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the changes in the orient@@ ations as well as the preparation of the future programs and defining their total size , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the field of merger .
the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Gover@@ ning Committee , the Advisory Group and the coordin@@ ating committees have a consult@@ ative character .
the opinion of the VG to the urgent actions is mandatory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the area of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two parties work on the work of all technical advisory bodies or all administrative bodies that are created for the purposes of the present agreement .
Switzerland &apos;s contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is determined annually on an amount that is at the expense of the Eur@@ atom programme in the same ratio as the gross domestic product of Switzerland for the entire gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Company as soon as it is established .
moreover , Switzerland has issued an amount to the Common Company J@@ ET , which is to be determined in accordance with the regulations of the Stat@@ ute of the Common Company .
the contribution of the financial contribution of Eur@@ atom to finance the work within the association agreement and the agreement on the exchange of personnel is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out on the basis of the corresponding contracts .
the Commission informs the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which is intended to cover spending within the Eur@@ atom programme for the relevant year .
the Federal Council pays the Commission to the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are specified in An@@ nex III to the present agreement .
Switzerland takes all necessary measures to exemp@@ t Eur@@ atom from customs or other duties as well as import prohi@@ bitions and restrictions to the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement .
in Switzerland , the objects that have been introduced or acquired there may not be sold free of charge in this country , unless approved by the Federal Council .
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to ho@@ ist@@ ers and bodies that are paid to these individuals .
the provisions on access to the knowledge that apply to the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 of the present Treaty are regulated in Article 14 and 15 of this Agreement , in the association agreement and in the agreement on the exchange of personnel .
the provisions on access to the knowledge that apply to the participation of Switzerland at the Common Company J@@ ET are regulated in Article 14 of this Agreement and in the Stat@@ utes of the Common Company .
the right of every contracting party to access to the knowledge of the other party is an essential part of this agreement .
- the exchange of personnel among the participating laboratories in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries ;
- adequate consideration of companies in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries in awar@@ ding contracts to carry out the two associated programs according to the principle of the best possible utilization of the amounts used .
the knowledge gained during the validity of this agreement in Eur@@ atom and in the associated organs in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics will be carried out by Switzerland and the individuals or companies that can justify the access to this knowledge under the same conditions as the Member States , individuals or companies of Eur@@ atom .
the knowledge gained in the research activities within the framework of this agreement in Switzerland will be communicated to the Member States of Eur@@ atom and the associated third countries , as well as persons or companies operating in a Member State of Eur@@ atom or an associated third @-@ state research or production activities that justify the access to this knowledge .
the Parties share this knowledge of other countries , persons or companies only when a relevant agreement is made between the parties , unless these persons or companies operate research or production activities in Switzerland that justify the access to this knowledge .
if the knowledge acquired under Section 1 and 2 of this article is protected by patents , these patents may be used by the Member States of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , the associated third countries and the persons or companies located in the countries concerned , for research purposes in pursuit of the objectives of this agreement .
the Member States of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , the associated third countries and the persons or companies located in the countries concerned may be granted licenses or sub @-@ licenses for use of these patents for industrial or commercial purposes , as far as the parties are authorised to distribute such licenses or sub @-@ licenses .
the knowledge obtained from the activities of Eur@@ atom , the associated organs and Switzerland prior to the entry into force of this agreement will be made accessible to those States , individuals or companies , to whom the knowledge specified in section 1 and 2 is required , as far as this is necessary for the use of the knowledge recorded in these dig@@ its .
patents which derive from the activities specified in this section are provided to those states , individuals or companies who may obtain a license or a sub @-@ license to the patents mentioned in paragraph 3 of this article , as far as this is required for the use of these licenses or sub @-@ licenses .
the rights granted to the invent@@ ors or their legal success@@ ors are not affected by this article .
the Parties shall see from any action that could imp@@ air the pat@@ ent@@ ability of inventions arising from the activities mentioned in the paragra@@ phs 1 and 2 of this article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a mixed committee with the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom / Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which belongs to the representative of the Commission and representatives of the Federal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he checks all the measures that the cooperation can be improved within the framework of the agreement and keeps himself up @-@ to @-@ date on the status of the works . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a party of the contracting party considers that the other contracting party does not have an obligation within the framework of this agreement , it is in@@ compatible with the Fu@@ sions@@ Committee of Eur@@ atom Switzerland .
the Eur@@ atom / Switzerland fusion committee can be used to carry out its tasks on the basis of the VG recommendations , which will be communicated to the authorities of the Eur@@ atom countries and Switzerland responsible for the adoption of programmes and budget plans in the areas of research .
the chair@@ person is ch@@ aired by the contracting parties altern@@ ately in accordance with the Rules of Proced@@ ure of the Eur@@ atom / Switzerland Joint Committee .
the Eur@@ atom / Switzerland fusion committee is jointly submitted to one of the contracting parties , but at least once a year .
disputes arising in connection with the interpretation or application of this agreement will be submitted to an arbit@@ ral tribunal at the request of one of the two parties .
the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal referred to in section 1 of this article is case @-@ case @-@ case .
each contracting party names a member , and these two members determine a third member , who holds the presi@@ dency of the arbit@@ ration court .
each contracting party bears the cost of its own member in the arbit@@ ration proceedings ; the costs of the presi@@ dency and the other costs are borne in equal parts by both parties .
it enters into force when the parties have communicated to each other that the procedures required for this purpose have been carried out .
this agreement will be closed for the duration of the Eur@@ atom programme mentioned in Article 1 ; it will be extended implic@@ itly in accordance with other relevant program decisions by Eur@@ atom .
if such a further program decision is issued , the extension for the duration of the new program will be extended to the point of the Eur@@ atom programme listed in App@@ endi@@ x I . this agreement shall not be terminated if there are only delays in the adoption of another Eur@@ atom programme .
prior to each decision regarding the adoption of a new Eur@@ atom programme , the Parties shall consult with the organs of the present agreement as part of the provisions mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Articles 16 .
each contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement at any time , subject to a period of six months .
in the form of a letter of correspondence to am@@ end the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
furthermore , in order to simplify the procedure for the adaptation of customs tari@@ ff names in the event of renewed changes to the customs tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it also appears to include in the agreement an article 12 up to .
I honor you to confirm the agreement of the Community to these changes , and suggest you as an appointment for the entry into force of January 1 , 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government for the above .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your current writing with the following wor@@ ding :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you confirmed the approval of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks put an appropriate application .
the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ icing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all member countries &quot; future deployment funds .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for whose application the BI@@ S would be ready .
with each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would first assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without having been exceeded for a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as in the extension of any extension the BI@@ S would charge a commission fee .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing will not be made before the end of a month after the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawings would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods taking into account the means of the Bank , expected to be three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those transactions carried out by the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary funds themselves on the market , then the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the corresponding margin increased Li@@ bor .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
I commend myself to take note of the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on imports of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations , both parties are passed as follows :
- fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina according to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in battle body weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the quantity of the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed amount and executed according to conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community adop@@ ts the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to Argentina as a common market is not affected by this agreement .

on the entry of new Member States , the Community in Consul@@ tation with Argentina will change the amount specified under number 2 according to the volume of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Agreement ; this shall be invo@@ iced to the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion mentioned under number 5 .
the total amount named under number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 23@@ ,000 tons of car@@ c@@ asses .
the community under@@ takes all to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the community market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions in order to prevent the sales of intervention stocks in frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation the sales of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat not under@@ mining .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other support measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb and from slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs is only done at prices and conditions which comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Articles 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General customs and trade agreement .
Argentina warran@@ ts compliance with this agreement , in particular by granting import lic@@ ences to the quantities named under number 1 within the amount specified in this agreement .

the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way as to wai@@ ve the position of a security deposit for the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the question@@ able products .
it is also stipul@@ ated in implementing regulations that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community regularly informs the amounts for which export licenses have been issued ; these details may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to country of destination if necessary .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and functioning properly .

I commend myself to take note of the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community .
- fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - lamb and goat meat ( F@@ are ff 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the common customs tari@@ ff ) ;
- frozen H@@ amm@@ el - lamb and goat meat ( F@@ are 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the common customs tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following annual quantity :
in order to guarantee a faul@@ tless functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is obliged to ensure that the quantity of goods actually executed does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out according to conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community adop@@ ts the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Access to Uruguay &apos;s access to the community market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the Community under@@ takes to restrict the exhaus@@ tion of products collected by this agreement to a throughput rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
on the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the amount specified under number 2 according to the scope of Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Agreement ; this shall be invo@@ iced to the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion mentioned under number 5 .
the total amount named under number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 5 800 tons of slaughter weight .
the community under@@ takes all to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the community market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions in order to prevent the sales of inter@@ vention@@ ist states in frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation , not under@@ mining the he@@ el of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an arti@@ san@@ ship .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other support measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb and from slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs is only done at prices and conditions which comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Articles 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General customs and trade agreement .
Uruguay ensures compliance with this agreement in particular by granting import lic@@ ences to the quantities named under number 1 within the amount specified in this agreement .
the Community , on its part , comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the above @-@ mentioned products is made dependent on the submission of an export license which is designated by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
it is also stipul@@ ated in implementing regulations that the competent ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community regularly informs the amounts for which export licenses have been issued ; these details may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to destination country .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Uruguay on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year in writing .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties prior to April 1 , 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government with this letter .

from this point on , a state cannot become the contracting party of the Convention , without becoming the contracting party of the Ad@@ ditional Protocol .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe notes the Member States of the Council of Europe , all States and the European Economic Community every acceptance or objection to Article 2 as well as the time of entry into this additional protocol according to Article 2 .
the Secretary @-@ General also noti@@ fies the European Economic Community any action , Noti@@ fication or Communication in connection with this Convention .
whereas it is highly desirable if member states support each other when needed in the spirit of European solidarity in the procurement of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group identification ,
whereas mutual support is only possible if the constitution and use of these re@@ agents are subject to the regulation of blood group determination jointly by the Member States , and the necessary facilities and exceptions for their import are granted .
in the sense of this agreement , the term &quot; re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination &quot; means re@@ agents of human , animal , plant and other origin for blood group identification and to determine blood intoler@@ ances .

the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Council and the Associ@@ ate States a ) the time of the entry into force of this Convention and the names of the members who have signed or rati@@ fied it without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ;
each contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe in compliance with a deadline of one year .
a re@@ agent for blood @-@ group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by repeatedly di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be investigated .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely by the volume of the blood body in@@ undation in the total volume .
in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are worked out at present .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The efficacy of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter speci@@ fies the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the efficacy of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for international standard preparations ( at present Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the title of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison with the International Standard Candi@@ date or a state nor@@ men@@ tin in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B will contain 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available for free from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following table shows an example of a comparative title of the International Standard Ser@@ um Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unknown &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in fluid form according to the label lies at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the label date for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of the exp@@ ir@@ ation trials ; it must be approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0,5 BC of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxide in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the agent continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood @-@ group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein @-@ nitrogen per ml of flu@@ ffy or re @-@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents destined for the international exchange of blood group identification should not be arti@@ ficially colored , at least until an international agreement has come about through a unified system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent being in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity found in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination .
appropriate samples of all the re@@ agents that have been issued are to be kept from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood @-@ group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective share in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain solely substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents can contain no substances of human origin .
on each container , a black printed label is available in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in the dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for the replacement of the re@@ agent ,

anti @-@ R@@ h blood @-@ group sera of each specific@@ ity can be one of two types , which differ in the conditions under which ag@@ glut@@ ination is reached hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with others known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ completely &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as Rin@@ der@@ alb@@ um@@ in or with the help of other special methods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ ination on object carriers is also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells that are em@@ itted in their own serum or plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following requirements for the effectiveness of serum for determining the R@@ h @-@ group may be changed if international standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood @-@ group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more individuals imm@@ uni@@ zed by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that the an@@ tigen D does not contain .

in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time as specified by the manufacturer .
if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation period should not be lower in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , not less than with the ant@@ ol@@ ous antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of animals which can be imm@@ uni@@ zed by blood cells or specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A serum aggreg@@ ated human red blood cells containing A @-@ An@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it does not ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells , which contain no A @-@ An@@ tigen , that means those of blood groups 0 and B .
