<seg id="648">A) In accordance with this Convention, the Community of the Organisation in accordance with this Convention obtains information on core material that is subject to securing measures, and on the characteristics of the facilities which are responsible for the implementation of the securing measures concerning this material of Belang.</seg>
<seg id="649">B) i) The organization requires only the minimum level of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks according to the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="650">II) Information on investments is limited to the minimum level necessary for the use of safeguarding measures in regard to core materials subject to securing measures pursuant to this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="651">C) At the request of the Community, the organization is prepared to assess investment data, which considers the community to be particularly vulnerable, in the premises of the community.</seg>
<seg id="652">These data do not need to be materially transferred to the organization, provided that they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community.</seg>
<seg id="653">A) i) The organisation obtains the consent of the Community and States to the designation of inspectors for the States.</seg>
<seg id="654">II) Creates the Community either against proposed naming or at any time against a given designation, so the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative nominations.</seg>
<seg id="655">III) If, due to the repeated refusal of the Community, to agree to the designation of inspectors of the organisation, which is obstructed due to this Convention, the Council shall discuss the refusal, after the General Director of the Organization, referred to as the "General Director," with the aim of meeting appropriate measures.</seg>
<seg id="656">B) The Community and the States concerned undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspectors of the organization can actually do the tasks according to their agreement.</seg>
<seg id="657">(C) The visits and activities of the inspectors of the Organization are arranged in such a way that i) the possible harassment and disturbance for the Community and the States and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection are as low as possible;</seg>
<seg id="658">II) the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information is guaranteed to the inspectors of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="659">Each state applies to the organization, including its assets, funds and funds, as well as to its inspectors and other officials, to fulfil the provisions of the agreement on the privileges and liberations of the International Atomic Energy Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="660">The securing measures according to this agreement are terminated with regard to core material when the community and the organization realize that the material has been used or diluted in a way that it is no longer usable for nuclear activities, which is under the point of view of the securing measures of Belang, or has practically not been recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="661">The community notifies the organization according to the provisions of this Convention, the transfer of core material from the States, which is subject to the safeguarding measures according to this Convention.</seg>

<seg id="695">The purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the part I on securing measures.</seg>
<seg id="696">The aim of the method of securing measures set out in this Convention is the timely discovery of the divergence of significant quantities of nuclear power from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear powers for unknown purposes, as well as deterrence from such a branch through the risk of early discovery.</seg>
<seg id="697">For the submissions of the target specified in Article 28, material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance, verbatim with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical conclusion of the verification by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the material quantity, which is not proven for a certain period of time, is specified by specifying the accuracy limits for the specified dates.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out their investigations, the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the Community's security system.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the Community for Nuclear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In the application of their safeguarding measures, the Community of de Procedures and Measures will make use of the following manner and, as far as necessary, foresee how they are closer and appropriate in the supplementary agreements:</seg>
<seg id="702">A) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved, produced, lost, lost or otherwise from the stock removed core material and inventory;</seg>
<seg id="703">B) the evaluation of reproducibility and accuracy of measurements and estimation of measurement uncertainty;</seg>
<seg id="704">C) procedures for determining, checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient;</seg>
<seg id="705">E) method for evaluating accumulation of non-measured holdings and not measured losses;</seg>
<seg id="706">F) a protocol and report system which points out the core material inventory for each material balance sheet and the changes in this inventory including the one and outputs of the material balance zone;</seg>
<seg id="707">G) precautions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly;</seg>
<seg id="708">H) Procedures for the reimbursement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69.</seg>
<seg id="709">The securing measures according to this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation.</seg>
<seg id="710">B) Uran - or thoriumhalous material that has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel circulation under letter c) is introduced into the States, so the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material, provided that it is not introduced for specifically non-nuclear purposes;</seg>
<seg id="711">C) abandons core material, which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or isotope richment, the plant or the process phase in which it is produced, or if that core material or other material produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circulation cycle is introduced into the States, so it is subject to the other securing measures described in this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="712">A) The safeguarding measures envisaged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11. however, the community considers that the recovery of core material, which is subject to safeguarding measures according to this Convention, is temporarily not possible or desirable from residues, so consult the organization and the community on the application of suitable securing measures.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The safeguarding measures envisaged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13, provided that the organization and the community acknowledge that this core material is virtually non-recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="714">At the request of the Community, the organization frees the following core material from the securing measures according to this Convention:</seg>
<seg id="715">A) special fissile material, when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments;</seg>
<seg id="716">(B) Nuclear material, if it is used in non-nuclear activities according to Article 13, if such core material is recoverable, and</seg>
<seg id="717">C) Plutonium with an isotope concentration of Plutonium-238, which is over 80%.</seg>
<seg id="718">On request of the Community, the organisation frees core materials, which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this Convention, from these security measures, provided the entire nuclear material amount liberated by this article is at no point in time as</seg>
<seg id="719">A) a total of one kilogram of particular paltable material, which can consist of one or more of the following materials:</seg>
<seg id="720">II) Uran with an enrichment of 0.2 (20%) and above, calculated by multiplication of its weight with enrichment,</seg>
<seg id="721">III) Uran with an enrichment, which is below 0.2 (20%) and above the nature uranium, calculated by multiplication of its weight with the fivefold square of enrichment;</seg>
<seg id="722">(B) a total of ten metric tons of natural uranium and depleted uranium with enrichment of more than 0.005 (0.5%);</seg>
<seg id="723">C) Twenty metric tons of depleted uranium with an enrichment of 0.005 (0.5%) or below;</seg>
<seg id="724">If delivered core material is processed or stored together with core materials which are subject to the securing measures according to this Convention, precautions are taken for the re-application of the securing measures on that material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The Community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements which, in the scope, which is necessary for the successful and effective support of the tasks of the organisation according to this Convention, in particular determine how the procedures established in the Convention are applicable.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplementary agreements can be extended or altered without altering this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention. the Organization, the Community and the States undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within ninety days of the entry into force of this Convention; an extension of this period requires the Council between the Organization, the Community and the States.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62, the organization sets up a summarised inventory of the whole, the safeguarding measures of this convention in the states, irrespective of its origin, and continues this inventory list due to the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States of Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the international economic cooperation conference in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hampered by general ressources of resources.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months following the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible issued within two years of entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bindings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organization of the EEC has presented a table from which it is intended to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization organises a special account under the name "Special transaction account," which states the Member States in accordance with this agreement to the special transactions account; this account is referred to by the Organization as administrator and used (in this property the organization is referred to as "administrator"), only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transactions account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are as follows: a) The payment shall be made in the form of cash or non-interest notes of the Member State, which shall be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state to the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the organization's deposit in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment shall be made in two installments, and i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the order within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the appointed time appointed;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second at the level of the balance of the agreement on 1 January 1979, or at a time agreed between the EEC and the administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may make payments on request before the aforementioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes about proportional drawings to the cash or the school junk to cover the expenses for the transaction loans and balance the special transactions account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of this loan, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country's current and predictable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its other lending capacity to loan terms without discounted; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) The extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Every transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly convertible development program or project (including a sectoral plan), irrespective of whether it belongs to the organization's loan program or not, according to the procedures and practices, which are considered, approved and administered by means of funding provided by the Organization, with the objective of contributing to this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction may not be used instead of regular funds from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organisation, which have been approved as part of a loan or credit for a program or project that has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special action loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions, which apply to the development loans granted by the Organization; they are therefore repayable in ten years of age each in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">"" "" "" "special transactions are provided in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies." ""</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts to pay this bib must be paid directly to the organization that maintains it.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each transaction loan must be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the source of the funds is specifically stated.</seg>
<seg id="751">The revenues from each special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are made or provided in a Member State; ii) in developing countries, the members of the organization and who, according to what the administrator has set at the time of the loan granted, may be recipients of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of special transactions are carried out on the special transactions account, and the amount paid back in this way in the currency of a member state is to be returned as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The administrator holds the EEC on the plans and programs approved by the directors until the complete tender of all special transactions for the EEC.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of repayment of the special transaction loans, the administrator is briefing the EEC on the development of the special transactions loan and the expenses they have made.</seg>
<seg id="755">As soon as possible after the end of the organisation's financial year, the administrator transmits a detailed calculation of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external auditors of the organization to this statement.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loans, the administrator of the EEC sends a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special transaction bank as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and executes appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transactions account, which account for the amounts paid to the account and the payments paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States are evident.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the administrators work closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the bailiff up to the full issue of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions, and on all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978, or at a later date, if the EEC and the Organization were not entered into force, the agreement and all the ensuing obligations of the parties are due immediately.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of capital paid by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and remitted to the Member States, this agreement and all the ensuing obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="762">This agreement requires approval from the individual Member States and the EEC according to the procedural rules of each party.</seg>
<seg id="763">The governments of the Member States notify the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings in question.</seg>
<seg id="764">The General Secretariat passes these notifications along with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the organization.</seg>
<seg id="765">This agreement will be effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned notifications in the organization.</seg>
<seg id="766">This agreement is written in two documents in Danish, German, English, French, Italian and Dutch, and each wording is equally authentic.</seg>
