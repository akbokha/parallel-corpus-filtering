this document is a summary of the European Public Reporting Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you require further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. t@@ wir@@ l thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , a mental illness in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal elevation ) alternating with periods of normal atmosphere .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ing or the melting tablets used in patients , which causes difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , which are also broken down like Abi@@ li@@ fy , Abi@@ li@@ fy &apos;s dose should be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this affects signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to one another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial ag@@ it@@ onist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole works like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the occurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases suffering from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with placebo .
in another study Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol for over twelve weeks , in another study the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent re@@ occurring to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased un@@ rest , with which from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to intake .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly greater in the symptoms of increased un@@ rest than patients receiving placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled sugar ) , tre@@ mor ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( increased sali@@ vary ) , ti@@ redness and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder , as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who have predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , out@@ weigh the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in fast control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the launch of Abi@@ li@@ fy throughout the European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be taken into account when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changes of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no higher risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ eric and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or stop the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , have to be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was one of these studies , a study with fixed dose , a significant relationship between dosage and response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to deterior@@ ating glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central potent drugs with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 ant@@ agonist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metabolism , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ abo@@ lization .
if you consider the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy begins .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , together with Abi@@ li@@ fy , can be expected with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to the lack of data for human safety and due to the concerns raised in reproductive studies in humans , unless the potential benefit clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk for fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned to use dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ ema , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under o@@ ste@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder - in a controlled trial for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ola was treated and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3,5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events related to anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurrence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ doses of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a death sequence .
there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has high plasma proteins .
it is thought that the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity with the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hi@@ stam@@ ine H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks at healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , on the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and in the pla@@ za .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who had a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Depres@@ sions@@ Rate @-@ Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lang @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , less patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy trials for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients suffering from a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which in part did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period of more than 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ l was superior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar revers@@ al , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for the de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ logging of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination @-@ down time is approximately 75 hours for ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ isation via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 14@@ 6 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metabolism through C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a simulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no evidence of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional precau@@ tionary studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so that they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al cycle toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al cor@@ dial carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al rin@@ ds ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average ste@@ wards state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found in the human g@@ all found no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study more than 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in an O@@ lang @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , less patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as a solution to intake of 30 mg ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in tablet form in healthy volunteers , the ratio of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control as@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution and started using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
in order to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and to minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by b@@ yp@@ assing of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status , taking into account the medicines already used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ag@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different to schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not present for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ eric and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of m@@ ns are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to worsen@@ ing of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study , in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was used as one @-@ time intra@@ muscular and the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were intra@@ muscular .
105 The ant@@ agonist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metabolism can result in a joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy begins .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were intra@@ muscular , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole after all@@ ying .

the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ola was treated and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ola was treated and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was treated and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( ret@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3,5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events related to anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurrence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant significant improvements in ag@@ gi@@ dity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as ag@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms regarding the ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm .
the mean recovery from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gi@@ dity , a similar efficacy was observed in terms of the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced patient count .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who had a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( or@@ ally ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions@@ Rate , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( or@@ ally ) showed a significantly higher rate of return , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( or@@ ally ) group and at 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lang @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients suffering from a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which in part did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was superior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar revers@@ al , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours of intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % greater than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were intra@@ muscular 15 and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which lay in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( or@@ ally ) for safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal @-@ loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ state aden@@ omas / carcin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended dose or between 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which lead to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters of which had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in the sole dose or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy .
considering only patients treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to worsen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before starting treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was not more effective in patients in whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given to other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel in order to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the European Commission of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ens &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or serious sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during abrasion therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been carried out with patients with impaired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of the ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have essentially other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment can be initiated and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in patients no longer abrasion treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ iles increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abrasion .
while a cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in case of nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients following the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women at child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is essential .
women at child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm conservation , because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) , which can affect the transport efficiency and the ability to serve machines .
listed below are the most common and most important events of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of abrasion in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most noticeable hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 contains the side effects that have occurred in combination with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , elevated phosph@@ or in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , blo@@ ating , tongue burn , dry mouth , pain@@ less g@@ ums , loose stools , eyel@@ ashes , sor@@ es in the abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscul@@ ature , neck pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness is very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al correlation has been established with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ tim@@ cr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules active ingredient that promotes the integration of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ ces and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by escap@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ sis .
this stabili@@ zation leads to in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein ( SP@@ ARC ) protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two armed non @-@ inter@@ linked studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ centre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre @-@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line treatment are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to termin@@ ate bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
active ingredient exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Accor@@ ding to the IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase way .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a wide @-@ ranging extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft tissue binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 minutes in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane dose ( 43 % ) compared to a solvent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , indicating a far @-@ reaching no @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of 75 , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and above all light protected over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic medicine and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be respected when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane gas bottle .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the pier@@ cing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good wet@@ ting of the solid material .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels in which complications may occur if a blood trans@@ fusion is not possible before surgery and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for whom the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who wish to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received an appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be monitored before the treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by a ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency or that the body does not sufficiently address the body &apos;s ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced that enables them to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in the case of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to the reference drug .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a vein for at least eight weeks before receiving either Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of the skin inj@@ ected under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to make sure that no allergic reactions are triggered .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that according to the regulations of the European Union evidence that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Medic@@ inal Products P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit to enter the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .

symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender , and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the physician .
a rise in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can be observed in one patient over or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
given this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose should be reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
clinical results indicate that patients with very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
clinical results indicate that patients with very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

an@@ emia symptoms and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender , and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the physician .
given this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required to control an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the quantity of antibodies to the initial value increased , the dose of 150@@ I.@@ U. / kg should be kept three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. per week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ratio of rep@@ tiles of &lt; 40.000 l / µ@@ l has risen above the starting value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. per kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the quantity of rec@@ tum for ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be kept three times a week .
on the other hand , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) resp@@ . the cyclo@@ cy@@ te count increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ta@@ ves is required , should receive Ab@@ se@@ amed at a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed Therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately thereafter .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ser@@ oton@@ ic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the tube and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into circulation .
patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive un@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ cally known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the car@@ egi@@ alis or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the appearance of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of work , defined as a reduction in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased demand for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the optic disc value should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminum toxic@@ ity , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the optic disc value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the optic loc@@ us &quot; index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in should not be exceeded in patients with chronic kidney failure .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating active agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the dose of epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the an@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of increasing high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ ent coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for the assessment of the treatment efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , a 2 @-@ 3 weeks delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ response should be taken into account ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ ds should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
patients who are provided for greater electro @-@ orthop@@ edic surgery should , if possible , investigate the cause of an@@ a@@ emia before beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients who undergo a larger electrical orthop@@ edic procedure should have adequate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially for the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , an increased risk for post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular occur@@ ren@@ ces may exist for patients with an output equivalent of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy were returned when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7,5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in @-@ vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of interactions between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in terms of hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
about thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , trans@@ itory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , ret@@ un@@ al thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common adverse effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vascular occur@@ ren@@ ces ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 @-@ General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thropo@@ ds .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can cause thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations .
the techn@@ ologically recovered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ licate and in relation to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate part is identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of local patients .
it could be demonstrated with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulated the ery@@ thropo@@ genesis and did not influence the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese .

survival and tumour progression were investigated in five major controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the patient patient .
in these studies , the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than in the controls due to various common malign@@ ancies .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin patients and in case of controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transmitted to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumor patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value at 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels that are reached after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ sh@@ al fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated for three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ sh@@ al fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal studies with nearly the 20@@ x of the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa has led to reduced f@@ ö@@ tal@@ em body weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in the fet@@ al mortality .

prior to market launch and by agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the owner of the licensing authority has to supply medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packing situation . • An un@@ ambig@@ uous illustration of the correct use of the product , cooling boxes for transport by patients .
the owner of the authorization for placing on the market must ensure that the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system , described in version 3.0 , is set up and functioning in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application procedure before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the drug is applied to the transport .
the holder of the authorisation for placing on the market is obliged to undertake the studies listed in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan and additional measures for pharmac@@ o@@ gil@@ ance , as agreed in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) specified in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. as well as each subsequent update of the risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for human use . &quot;
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • When receiving new information , the impact on current safety specifications , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures may have mil@@ estones within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) • by promp@@ ting the E@@ MEA
• Have a heart attack or stroke in a month before your treatment - if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time appearing or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis in veins ( deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ) .
you suffer from severe bleeding disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the throat ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disorder ) you have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can result in a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range .
your doctor may take regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets on a regular basis during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , the dissolution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be considered and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed at the beginning of the therapy .
very rarely , ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin was reported on the appearance of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia , it will break down your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value could be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will make sure your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are still not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for the evaluation of the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dosage accordingly to minimize the risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic disease ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the advantages derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past , thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pulmon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
if you are a cancer patient , bear in mind that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can neg@@ atively affect the tumour .
if you are faced with an orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the start of treatment .
if your values of the red blood color@@ ant ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently been taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may be able to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or with HIV ) .
depending on how your blood sugar ( an@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests to check the success of your treatment and ensure that the medicine works correctly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of your treatment and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia responds to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a specific value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests .
if necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor thinks this is appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ it yourself under the skin .

ey@@ eli@@ ds and lips ( qu@@ ino@@ id ede@@ ma ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat feeling and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when using Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can occur - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with increased risk of bleeding after surgery ( post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your starting weight is too high

if a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the fridge and has reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or rejected .
A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease which makes bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as in the case of H@@ inf@@ alle ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for the evaluation of A@@ cla@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women were involved with o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a frac@@ ture frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cla@@ sta side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cla@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cla@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion site and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cla@@ sta provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis , which contains indications how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
April 2005 The European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve the launch of A@@ cla@@ sta in the entire European Union .

o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ ditional charges in pregnancy and nursing women • The requirement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance
o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating the Pa@@ get disease .
after a treatment of the Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least 500 mg of vital calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by giving par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 , since data is missing for safety and efficacy .
A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the start of the therapy ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid insertion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least 500 mg of vital calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry .
for patients who require dental interventions , no data is available , whether the inter@@ ruption of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates treatment reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical review by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by giving par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as severe side effects was increased in patients who received A@@ cla@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) were the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which were expressed as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing ( measured before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were in a clinical trial in o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cla@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with ap@@ cla@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were up to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Pa@@ get @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received supple@@ mental sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Pa@@ get Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ics in a large clinical trial were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw region , especially in cancer patients , reported on o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ics , were treated .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rop@@ sis in the jaw area of a patient treated with A@@ cla@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients .
in the case of over@@ dosing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ ic@@ a@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by giving oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 to 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) or BM@@ D T @-@ Sc@@ ore for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ - 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric curves were significantly reduced over a period of three years , as well as the frequency of one or more new spinal frac@@ tures after one year ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared with placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on the lum@@ bar spine , hips and dist@@ al radius compared with placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the fem@@ al neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the pel@@ vic ridge were taken .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the retention of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone structure in comparison with placebo .
bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were measured in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during study duration .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cla@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the output value for up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output value for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output value for up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo @-@ treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D at all time points compared to placebo treatment .
compared to placebo treatment , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to an increase of BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % at the overall intake and 4.3 % on the fem@@ oral neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cla@@ sta compared to the once weekly donation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cla@@ sta was studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically proven , above all light to moderate severe mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( average serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.6 @-@ 3.@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value when taken into the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 patients treated with the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response in 141 patients treated with a@@ cla@@ sta , compared with 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , could be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plasma gas rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life periods t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination hour t ½ γ at 14@@ 6 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body clearance is independent of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to a 30 % decrease in Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron concentration at the end of in@@ fusion but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration vs. time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearance of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function disorder up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid requires .
as for severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ al@@ ous intraven@@ ous single dose amounted to 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and in rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight .
studies in dogs were given single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was administered in rats by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg , administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulative ex@@ positions that adequately exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure occurred toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and intraven@@ ous injection .
the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spontan@@ ei@@ osa in the metap@@ hysi@@ cal metaph@@ or of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , findings that reflect the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity of dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum calcium levels .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for Medic@@ inal Products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known which could affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) was reached . • On request of E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a substance that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the bone of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens produced from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , bone reconstruction is done too quickly , and new bone material is set up un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
A@@ cla@@ sta works by restoring the bone structure back to normal , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus giving the bones a strength again .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cla@@ sta .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently been taken / used , even if they are not prescription drugs .
it is particularly important for your doctor to know if you take medicines that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using A@@ cla@@ sta along with food and drinks , please ensure that you take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta according to your doctor &apos;s instructions .
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you recently broke the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
since A@@ cla@@ sta has a long period of time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your blood after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta was missed , contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
before stopping the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta If you consider the termination of treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please notice your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received A@@ cla@@ sta .
physical signs due to a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or healing wounds in the mouth or at the jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if any of the listed side effects may affect you significantly or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information information .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment .
due to the rapid insertion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic @-@ running hypo@@ kal@@ ic@@ a@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding to at least twice daily 500 mg of vital calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta .

A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , including body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more I
in addition , four studies have been carried out to over 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent in comparison to a placebo .
on the other hand , the studies on setting smoking showed no consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this area of application .
what is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia that were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nausea and respiratory infections of the upper respiratory tract .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , result in a small minority of patients suffering from su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts .
caution is advisable when using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or i@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicine against fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use with HIV infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
medicines used in patients who need it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing educational packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the ar@@ z
it also contributes to diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also contain one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data for efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported to up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefits of treatment in individual cases out@@ weigh the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
also in patients who - apart from obesity - have no recognizable risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other closest individuals ) must point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been adequately demonstrated .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke , etc . ) were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months ago .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Reporting Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) that cannot be adequately adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic res@@ ins or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic res@@ ins or insulin can be retained with the start of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic res@@ ins or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in triple therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic res@@ ins , in addition , they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or placebo .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar values were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg dosage .
at the end of the triple therapy study , the effect of an additional dose of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment of met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic res@@ ins decreased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin were reported to decrease the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in those patients who additionally took placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ c@@ thesia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in , Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit to transport Ac@@ tos across the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequately adjusted with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treating with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be aware of signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be aware of signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ going study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ ascular disorder was performed .
this study showed an increase in cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency reports , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T @-@ level is increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels will be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach upset , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels must be checked .
the decision as to whether the treatment of the patient continues with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be guided by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are present .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases connected to fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of the middle hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ ite ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ ato@@ glob@@ in by 3.1 @-@ 4.2 % and hem@@ ato@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or as a two @-@ part combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch , a reduction of visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ genes , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a occurrence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is unclear whether there is a direct link between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the incidence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but the prescription doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report on disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be taken into consideration .
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker , and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin resistance resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the parent animal is reduced , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not estimated from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and refra@@ ction index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic substances .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege was more than three times the upper limit of the normal range than placebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic res@@ ins .
in an outcome study in patients with advanced mac@@ ular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
since its launch , it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but more often when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure .
a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active trial conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
while taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms appeared .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on appears to act as an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be demonstrated that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose enhancement in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ sia as mon@@ otherapy was continued for over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect was left ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the onset of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ sia ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequately controlled in spite of a three @-@ month optimization phase with insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as in@@ significant , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the total plasma matrix gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids in comparison with placebo , met@@ form@@ in or bile acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison with placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while lower levels of met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ sia were observed .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both with an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentration of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma can usually be reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness is roughly three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies it has been demonstrated that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was mainly found in the Fä@@ zes ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma elimination time of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clearance of the parent substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlar@@ ging with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin resistance resulting in the creation decreases and increased insulin resistance of the parent animal is reduced , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( for male and female rats ) and tumours ( for male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to increased frequency of col@@ on@@ tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
in another study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal were investigated .
in clinical studies more than 1 year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the initial values .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , this with an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study lack@@ ed the target of its primary end@@ point , a combination of the total mort@@ al , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , coron@@ ary re@@ vit@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels , suggest@@ ing that blood glucose levels were reduced similarly to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
it may also be possible to adjust the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood sugar ( the complete list can be found in the package insert ) .
the CH@@ MP &apos;s Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weighed in the treatment of diabetes in relation to the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the launch of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily , if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood glucose levels have improved significantly by intensified insulin therapy can perceive the symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and should be advised accordingly .
any change in starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin analog or insulin analogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin produced from animal origin ) may lead to a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients who occurred hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and consult his patients always after other medicines taken by them .

severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es , and may end with temporary or permanent brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Occ@@ a@@ sional - peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are normally rever@@ sible .
5 A intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar adjustment can however be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection point , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may arise when failed to change the insertion points within the injection area .
general disorders and complaints at the date of delivery - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection point Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) may occur .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can , however , be progres@@ sively developed : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated by oral glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape @-@ sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juices . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a given aid or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on the conventional precau@@ tionary studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans .

before each injection , check that at least 12 units of insulin are left in the cartridge , ensuring an even blend .
follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards • kno@@ ck a few times with the finger against the cartridge .
if air bubbles are present , they will accumulate at the top of the cartridge - While you continue to hold Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards , turn the cartridge to the top of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Dur@@ ing the injection needle simply press in ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Now from the tip of the injection needle a drop of insulin must leak out .
• Place the closure cap back so on the pen , that the number 0 stands opposite the metering brand ( Fig@@ ure E ) • Check if the push button is fully compressed .
if not , turn the cap down until the push button is pressed completely . hold your Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ Let horizont@@ ally .
if the push button does not move freely out@@ wards , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves to the outside while you are rotating the closure cap • The scale under the pressure button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
check the number on the closure cap right next to the dosing schedule • add the highest number you can see on the push@@ button • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set up a wrong dose , turn the lid forward or backwards until you have set the correct number of units .
otherwise insulin is removed from the injection needle and the set dose will not be correct • If you have tried er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously to set a dose of more than 78 units , follow the steps below :
then remove the cap and put it back in such a way that the 0 of the metering brand is opposite .
be sure to press the pressure button only during the injection . • Ke@@ ep the pressure button completely down after the injection , until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
if not , turn the closure cap until the push button is pressed completely and then proceed as described in Before U@@ sing • You can now hear a click of the sound when pressing the push button .
it may be incorrect • You cannot dose a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge - you can use the residual volume scale to estimate how much insulin is left .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the implementation of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin must first be raised , then the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the date of delivery - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) may occur .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape @-@ sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juices . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a given aid or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures demonstrated that a reduced mortality rate by 42 % was reduced by 42 % ( 8 % vs. 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
the data are limited but suggest that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
in@@ fusion systems with Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0,@@ 05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1,@@ 0 I.@@ U. / ml insulin in the in@@ fusion fluids 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable at room temperature for 24 hours at room temperature .
11 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

this can happen : if you are inj@@ ecting too much insulin , if you eat too little or leave a meal - if you are more than otherwise physically demanding
let the closure cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let finished pen always be set when it is not in use to protect it from light .
• Rem@@ ove the rubber membrane with a medical ac@@ upun@@ cture • Use always for each injection a new injection needle to avoid contamination . • Rem@@ ove the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Fig@@ ure A ) • Dra@@ ve the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards • kno@@ ck a few times with the finger against the cartridge .
if air bubbles are present , they will accumulate at the top of the cartridge - While you continue to hold the injection needle upwards , turn the cartridge around one click in the direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure B ) • Dur@@ ing the injection needle further upwards , press the push button in the right way ( Fig@@ ure C ) • Now , a drop of insulin is required from the tip of the injection needle .
• Place the closure cap back so on the pen that the number 0 stands opposite the metering brand ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Check if the push button is fully compressed .
if the push button does not move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves to the outside while you are rotating the closure cap • The scale under the pressure button ( pressure button scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Noti@@ fy the highest number you can see on the push@@ button scale • Ad@@ de the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set up a wrong dose , turn the lid forward or backwards until you have set the correct number of units .
rotate it until the push button is down and you feel a resistance . then remove the cap and set it up so that the 0 of the metering brand is opposite .
be sure to press the pressure button only during the injection process . press the push button after the injection , until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
it may be incorrect • You cannot set any dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge you can use the residual quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can &apos;t use them to adjust or select your dose .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients displaying already signs of crystal de@@ br@@ is , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or pla@@ ques ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. greater ur@@ anium deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level still exceeds 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first months of treatment , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients at least take other medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ uria .
the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ uria ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients receiving aden@@ uria in a dose of once daily 80@@ mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients receiving 120 mg once a day , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was the case at 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ uria ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea , nausea , and abnormal liver results .
especially in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ uria was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but there could also be a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to pri@@ mor@@ dial deposits ( including a known or currently available g@@ out node and / or arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents as there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
if there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , treatment with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ able drugs , it may lead to acute diar@@ rho@@ ea during the treatment , because the reduction of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ate sa@@ ws initially can mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine is so widespread in rare cases , that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract .
during Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3,5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before starting the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s and in the subsequent course ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was not carried out interactions studies on f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine level ( inhibit@@ ing the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ographic exposition ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active substance required at the same time .
in a study conducted with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily showed a moderate 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an An@@ ta@@ zi@@ shower containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a reduction of the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , however , does not cause significant changes in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data concerning a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
experimental studies do not include either direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or performing hazardous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a more numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the total f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ographic group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were ather@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could arise in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups in total more than once , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Off@@ ene long@@ term extension studies In the open long term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the treatment @-@ related events reported during long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups in total more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long term extension studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :

the active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and arises in the context of the hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid reaction process .
f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ Pur@@ im @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro inhibit@@ ing , located below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX trial and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were carried out with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ k@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with the last three month @-@ specific serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) for patients with a serum carcin@@ ogen@@ ic value of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .

the lowering of the serum urine acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum carcin@@ oma &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al dysfunction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( d. h ) .
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clinical significant differences in the percentage decrease in the ser@@ um@@ ina acid concentrations in subjects , irrespective of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum @-@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
data from the open extension study phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ate acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks , so that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed treatment against a con@@ sp@@ ection ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require treatment against a g@@ post ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the number of g@@ ums , which resulted in 54 % of patients experiencing a complete disappearance of the g@@ ums up to 24 months .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ U / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5,@@ 0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose is dose @-@ proportional .
for doses of 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ MA@@ x amounts approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in the acid concentration , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range that is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

these findings are considered as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day , F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already being used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to verify the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only took al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dosage contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose required to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pains of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , tri@@ ck@@ ered abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as acid clas@@ ps .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE cannot be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients .
it must not be applied in case of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us disease , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or for patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can only be taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day &apos;s rise . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or let the tablet dissolve in the mouth , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , only be given under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al lines , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ ital@@ isation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation , and patients should be informed about the occurrence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ um pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and pick up medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or take it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .

there are no data available that indicate whether the onset of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients needing a max@@ illary surgery reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rop@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is author@@ itative for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take tablets next morning after they have noticed their dor@@ man@@ t .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned on the planned week of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
for this reason , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rop@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports were reported by cancer patients , but also reported on o@@ steopor@@ osis .
nevertheless , the intake of serum calcium up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / l ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate following an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract like stomach upset , heart@@ burn , ec@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one year multi @-@ center trial of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III trials , the average intake of BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur@@ h@@ al and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % compared to placebo ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more ed@@ dy frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of BM@@ D from spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to stop ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the entire body was also maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continued either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new fluid frac@@ ture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Be@@ ared on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the medi@@ al oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before admission of a standardised breakfast .
the bio@@ availability declined to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) did not lead to a clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies on rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly circul@@ ates into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion Accor@@ ding to intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of radio@@ actively sign@@ aled substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the subjects .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clearing was not exceeded 200 ml / min .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is affected by these transport systems .

ex@@ cre@@ tion In the application of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 to healthy volunteers , the middle ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the subjects 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is ex@@ cre@@ ted rapidly via the urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is nevertheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
for this reason , reduced kidney function in patients with reduced kidney function can be expected in bone ( see section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ ant@@ ee is administered adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation whereby the application of Adv@@ ant@@ f was compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment period of one year ( by examining , for example , how often a new organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how adv@@ an@@ f compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft is absorbed by the body .

in patients suffering from hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , adv@@ an@@ f may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with Adv@@ ant@@ ee , as the Adv@@ ant@@ ee dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adapted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can result in gra@@ ft rejection or an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains preserved .
the dosage of Adv@@ ant@@ ee should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level measurements ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirrors should be controlled prior to the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 systemic exposure , measured as a mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ant@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate follow @-@ up phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the advance dose can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral consumption of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress transplan@@ t rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ t rejection The oral advocate therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change during the stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral advocate therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f must be converted a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily doses of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ant@@ ee , so this conversion has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ an@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation must begin the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection .
heart transplan@@ tation For adult patients who are converted to adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily .
other transplan@@ t recipients - although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ an@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ted patients , was in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in color@@ ect@@ al gra@@ fts in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups Pati@@ ents with reduced liver function To maintain blood levels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum carcin@@ omas , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ee and supervision of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ant@@ f When switching from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy caution is advisable ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the help of full blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ level controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f , Dos@@ age Adju@@ st@@ ment , Chan@@ ges of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances that could change the blood @-@ blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ant@@ ee is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the blood level in the blood does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the Tal@@ mirrors of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations are usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and kidney transplan@@ ted patients with 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ tation receivers , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur in the result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation adv@@ an@@ f .
to proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ tation receivers and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation adv@@ an@@ f are still present .
due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , taking herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies during treatment with Adv@@ ant@@ ee ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful observation of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ us concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations .
in rare cases Pro@@ gra@@ f was able to observe a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy known as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ant@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and visual disturbances , should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ ant@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ated , lac@@ tose are included , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels with simultaneous administration of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us due to the in@@ hibition of the gastro@@ intestinal metabolic rate .
highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; hence , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect their metabolism .
because tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormone exposition , it is particularly cau@@ tious when making decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal testing have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of the pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , supervision of the new@@ born is recommended for possible damaging effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and hyper@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a large number of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases such as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ als ) .
cases of non @-@ virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ ant@@ ee .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in combination with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high binding on ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sible .
active mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ K@@ B@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enri@@ ching the connection in the cellular jaw@@ s .
this leads to a calcium @-@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction due to the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain series of lymph@@ oma genes .
tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on the T @-@ hel@@ per cells , furthermore the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in the major studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t receivers .
lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi @-@ center trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported that received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .
in the case of patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , in 21.@@ 7 % of cases the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients converted from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was increased after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment plan patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
pancre@@ as transplan@@ tation A multi@@ center trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation at the same time receiving a random@@ ised tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the target level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
intestinal transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tation revealed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row aug@@ mentation , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 ant@@ agonist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , which lead to a mirror between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently transplan@@ tation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) .
factors such as low hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ ite value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of the metabolism of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done through the bile .
for stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ ant@@ f ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) related to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
21 In the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ t rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation adv@@ an@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .

Adv@@ ance is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital blood coag@@ ulation disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advoc@@ ates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced into the formation of the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the drug was used to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ents in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood c@@ anti@@ sep@@ tics was &quot; excellent &quot; and &quot; good &quot; respectively .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ance ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ance may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , according to the location and the extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall under the indicated plasma gas ( in % of the standard or I.@@ U. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat the injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the treatment course , an appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value lives .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the speed of the administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of inhibit@@ ors is cor@@ related with the magnitude of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ cally known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , re@@ occurrence of ( low ti@@ tr@@ es ) inhibit@@ ors has been observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there is no experience regarding the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the AD@@ R@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected decrease in the blood coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ egels was performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Spiegel in the plasma and the clearing rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) showed only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , in none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was detected after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
previously untreated patients from a ongoing clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the appearance of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ er gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency unknown ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a c@@ of@@ actor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients equal or &gt; 10 years and are listed in chart 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP still evaluated the benefit @-@ risk weighing as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E security profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited distributed the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company accepts its application for approval for the use of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissues that connect , surround and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ im is a Aden@@ o@@ virus , which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot cause infections in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene , which is not defective in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
in case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer occurred in the area of the lower abdom@@ en , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP examined the company &apos;s answers to the questions presented to him , some questions were still unclear .
based on the examination of the initial submission documents , the CH@@ MP created a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in &apos;s injection in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore brings benefits to patients .
the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is not harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not notice the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; endor@@ sed @-@ use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and young people aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with or without food with a glass of water .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ amped .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be followed by con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy levels were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms which were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when examining all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who had lost lost at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mou@@ th@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients suffering from con@@ stri@@ ction glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular disease including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( stroke caused by brain hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company SP Europe to appro@@ ve the launch of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is swal@@ lowed in whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in children under the age of 12 due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible to keep and should not be continued after end of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days as long @-@ time application can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ li@@ de , ur@@ got@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiva , which are per@@ or@@ ally or nas@@ al as s@@ wollen Rhin@@ ology ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient &apos;s collective and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients suffering from kidney or liver function and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or increasing head@@ aches ) must be removed .
patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be dis@@ continued at least 48 hours before the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines may otherwise have positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
as part of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether or not Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
in @-@ vitro studies , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency in the normal population .
since reproductive studies of animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ ting properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a presum@@ ption that can lead to impaired mobility or the ability to serve machines .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ thal procedures .
headache , anxiety , difficult micro@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breath failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , per@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre @-@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ dry , pup@@ il star@@ vation and di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include blocking the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ Selec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was found at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause other symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s took part , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under one mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aero@@ bic tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city affili@@ ation .
in the context of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration in the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the floating balance weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
within the scope of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it has been noted that four subjects ab@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are poorly di@@ gesti@@ ble .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the all@@ ying gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional precau@@ tionary studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular danger to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudo @-@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ology studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and the Pharma@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines help relieve the allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and wat@@ ery or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur under the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • high blood pressure • Hear@@ ts , pal@@ pit@@ ations • Heart ar@@ rhyth@@ mia nerv@@ osa • nausea and head@@ aches or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
transport ti@@ ghtness and the application of machines When applying at the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze results in di@@ zz@@ iness or lowers the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ os@@ ol than you should .
if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects is significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information information .
heart ch@@ ase , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mou@@ th@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , throat pain , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , it was rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg of ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for inhal@@ ing ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg @-@ melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies on seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who had asthma ) .
the effectiveness has been measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rant , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to verify that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for inhal@@ ing and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were considered , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us led to an average decrease in the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo .
in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the European Commission for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of ab@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to previous disease progression and can be resum@@ ed after the end of symptoms and resum@@ ing .
in the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impaired mobility or the ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse effect was head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with ab@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , which administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ Selec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered daily for over 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was as@@ cer@@ tained for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of ae@@ ti@@ ology , is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited .
as hi@@ stam@@ ine stimulation is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , it is expected that in addition to chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ ri@@ ums at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines was excluded from the study .
improvement of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient demo@@ graphs were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not been identified yet , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
in @-@ vi@@ vo , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the pre @-@ clinical trials conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional precau@@ tionary studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular threat to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data exists which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher levels of substance ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is moder@@ ately met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normally .
this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup group .
in clinical trials of adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving adults and adolescents with a dose of up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children between the age of 1 and 11 who were eligible for anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received a daily intake of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of lost at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study on adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was used for ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not harm the psych@@ omot@@ or function .
in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not result in a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment or an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adults and young patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the resulting seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ ri@@ ums at the end of the first dose interval .
the dis@@ semination of this restra@@ ined phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ cas@@ us ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which may be supp@@ ressed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug cum@@ ulation after daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x levels of lost at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III brown bottles with a child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ ate can be removed without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G intervals .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has been used for over 14 days a day .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine times of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was found at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets once daily put in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of ab@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately prior to the application the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far .
overall frequency of adverse events between the ab@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at as a det@@ ectable formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
in the context of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this badly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , however , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us processed tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in connection with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between the ages of 2 and 11 , which is partially met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that which is normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in children .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ c@@ rose is@@ omer@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
in infants between 6 and 23 months the most common side effects reported more frequently than placebo reported diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years at a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
at recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were similar in children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the dis@@ semination of this restra@@ ined phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ cas@@ us ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ eri@@ us contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially told the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company accepts its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and older people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerges , which can easily spread from man to person because humans have not yet built up immunity ( no protection ) .
after the ino@@ cul@@ ation of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; body foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to produce antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this trunk .
subsequently , the membrane surface of the virus was cleaned up with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you require further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to inhal@@ ing , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has taken before , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to be addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice a day , taken together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ag@@ reg@@ ase after body weight is directed .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
this was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the study with adults who were previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load enhanced with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors following 16 weeks of treatment :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase joined together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for a stronger anti @-@ viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common A@@ gener@@ ase side effects ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients with St. John &apos;s wort ( an herbal supplement for treating depression ) or drugs that are just as degra@@ ded as A@@ gener@@ ase and are detri@@ mental to the blood in high concentrations .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase have the risk of cereb@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the CH@@ MP &apos;s Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years out@@ weigh the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of ag@@ reg@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who did not take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited the approval of the launch of A@@ gener@@ ase across the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % less than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ a Cap@@ sul@@ es are applied without the addition of the addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ a combined with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4 , due to the lack of data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be carried out with care in patients with mild or moderate liver function , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal course .
for the event of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic and active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver function disorders under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients who use this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma gas levels of ammon@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be supervised on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in duration 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , to which therapy medicines were needed which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it .
in ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ o@@ arthritis are present .
at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is adopted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rop@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic lati@@ tude are not given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ iso@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given along with medicines , whose agents are mainly metabol@@ ised using C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma gas levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already taking St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ blown @-@ up mirrors and , if possible , verify the viral load and de@@ compose the car@@ ob .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increases , whereas C@@ MA@@ x is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with am@@ sprin@@ cavi@@ ar capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % decreases if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the imagin@@ ative component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
for this reason , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dosage adjustment is not required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effects of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , be careful because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma gas .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus an increase in side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma pi@@ ping of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ ratio ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was observed .
other drugs that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may cause interactions if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be supervised by toxic reactions associated with these medicines when used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disturbances .
the simultaneous application of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as an enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine .
simultaneous use of ag@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) more than 7 days ago , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma level increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in the plasma gas must be expected at the same time administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this drug with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended since the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by ammon@@ avi@@ r simultaneously ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be applied together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same time A@@ gener@@ ase is advised with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma gas quality of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 to 4 @-@ fa@@ che .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be supervised on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially when administered also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation on how to adapt the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether am@@ sprin@@ cavi@@ ar passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered by the con@@ ni@@ fication in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not impaired by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely resulted in a treatment stop .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the adverse events listed below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring under the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fet@@ al fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation .
in 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral agents treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine for a medi@@ an duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ d@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medi@@ an duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ il@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred usually during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be abor@@ ted .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rop@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low doses ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were very common in patients who received ag@@ gener@@ ase together with low d@@ osed ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ cation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate adequate suppor@@ tive measures .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ protein pre@@ ampli@@ fiers with the result of an in@@ mature , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range between 0,@@ 0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans has not yet been defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being evaluated gen@@ otyp@@ ically .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ I , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / V , Q@@ 58@@ D , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ enor@@ mal@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based analysis systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced likel@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for assessing the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret results of resistance testing .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ osau@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients who failed to establish a limited cross @-@ resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , called sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a se@@ eding treatment is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which may adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s efficacy in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open trial ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ ga@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low d@@ osed ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in terms of time @-@ adjusted average change from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ leak threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of un@@ ble@@ ached A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was used three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day .
no low dose was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase of the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ reg@@ ase was to be taken into account when optimi@@ zing therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the medium duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound ammon@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound ammon@@ ium remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ent during dosing intervals varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State through the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily ammon@@ avi@@ r exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ basis .
also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ atal mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the genesis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and therapeu@@ tical applications , there was little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro fer@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( am@@ es test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity has been observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase after the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies at young age treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in case of systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , a number of minor changes including thy@@ me ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ a Cap@@ sul@@ es are applied without the addition of the addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should be carried out with caution in patients with weak or mild liver function , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be deposited in the duration of 27 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increases , whereas C@@ MA@@ x is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with am@@ sprin@@ cavi@@ ar capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available .

with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered in the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ cation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate adequate suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range between 0,@@ 0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ reg@@ ase was to be taken into account when optimi@@ zing therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound ammon@@ ium remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ent during dosing intervals varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State through the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .

toxic@@ ity studies at young age treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that the metabolism is not fully mature in young , so that am@@ pren@@ atal or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion was not documented in patients with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % less than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines , up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dose recommendation can be given for simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for inhal@@ ing and low d@@ osed ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorder ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed permanently if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ o@@ arthritis are present .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increases , whereas C@@ MA@@ x is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with am@@ sprin@@ cavi@@ ar capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous use of ag@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data of 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly increased plasma concentrations after Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am after oral treatment of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inhal@@ ing may not be applied to the contained propylene gly@@ col due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .
in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether am@@ sprin@@ cavi@@ ar passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered in the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 55 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
early abor@@ tion of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which may affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ reg@@ ase was to be taken into account when optimi@@ zing therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the application frequency and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream should be applied five times a week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream should be applied three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment .
before bed@@ time , the cream is ready to apply th@@ inner to the affected areas of the skin , so that it stays on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies in 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo performed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
• In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete treatment rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in those treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete treatment rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue until all visible natur@@ es have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ canal region , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
a break in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if in the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesi@@ ons are only completely cured , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ der the cream once he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to be applied in a thin layer and to rub in the puri@@ fied skin area infected with cow@@ berries until the cream is completely re@@ trac@@ ted .
these patients should be weighed between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of auto@@ immune disease .
these patients should be weighed between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ yo@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with a frac@@ ture leading to circumc@@ ision .
with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have resulted in temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experience has been carried out for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous appli@@ qu@@ és in the genital and per@@ ic@@ ular area .
although limited data suggests an increased rate of incl@@ ine reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the removal of cow@@ ards .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the severity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there is currently no data available for long @-@ term treatment rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be taken into consideration in super@@ fici@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experience exists , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tumours .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower likel@@ ihood of responding to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ stick .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or decline after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical trial reveals that patients with more than 8 lesi@@ ons reported a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with care in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not produce direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) were not obtained after a one @-@ time or after multiple topical application , no recommendation can be given during the breast@@ feeding period .
the most frequently shared and prob@@ able adverse events related to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s application in the studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions in the treatment of cow@@ berries ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
among the most commonly reported and prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effects include complaints at the application site with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical trial reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the context of side effects , were a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
the clinical signs assessed according to the review plan show that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials , three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often led to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ tion / sli@@ pping / shed ( 14 % ) and ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the review of clinical signs , this study showed that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often lead to severe ery@@ themes ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe snor@@ ing and reduction ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental unique oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could cause nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the most clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous liquid release .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after topical application of i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be demonstrated that the efficacy in reference to a complete healing of the pre@@ pen@@ ni@@ ces in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment .
in 60 % of the patients who had treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the patients were completely healed ; this was in the case of 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % from 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in five @-@ phase application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ elle bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of data show that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in one or two treatment times of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four week treatment period , has been studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic lesi@@ ons within a 25 c@@ m2 inter@@ connected 25 c@@ m2 area on the un@@ easy scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
patients with pa@@ edi@@ atric patients usually do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three weekly use during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ ten 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml when applied in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ imposed bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for the der@@ mal application for four months resulted in no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with der@@ mal administration in three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application site .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has only a low systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for humans is regarded as very low due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerve ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neurological symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the movements difficult , decreased lung volume , heart and eye disease .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a physician who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be administered in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ational devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study mainly examined the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by investigating its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known and where necessary to update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. to appro@@ ve the launch of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be raised every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or h@@ ep@@ atic in@@ suffici@@ ency has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 trial , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously cau@@ ti@@ ously after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment .
60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ ri@@ ties ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies do not include direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data is available to new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment .
the side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension with a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment period of up to 4 years , are reported in the following table following the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ ness and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe follow @-@ up form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , with a more severe follow @-@ up in patients aged 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to early retirement from the study ) , there were no det@@ ectable antibodies in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients , in which there was never a Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version .
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in urine .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which seemed to imp@@ air clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme treatment lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed into lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ tis @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which revealed the entire spectrum of diseases , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week for another 3,5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in the lung function and the capacity shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirrors was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end point , which summ@@ ari@@ zes clin@@ ically significant changes across five effici@@ encies ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , range in 6 @-@ minute walk , range of motion of the shoulder joint ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a decrease in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was carried out in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks because of increased G@@ ag@@ - mirrors in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) was observed after the Z @-@ Sc@@ ore for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form had a normal mental development speed , whereas the older patients with severe follow @-@ up form had limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were carried out at the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available every year , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional precau@@ tionary studies , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans .
since no case studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed under 6 . 6 .

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • To determine the number of dil@@ uted diar@@ rhe@@ a bottles by the body weight of each patient .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy for patients who have previously not been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( in order to prevent de@@ hydr@@ ation ) .
in patients whose hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus s@@ lows the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from spl@@ itting .
the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form proceeds more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active period in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study to 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin experienced an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , A@@ lim@@ ta &apos;s average survival was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients in whom cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival times than with the comparison medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. for the launch of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is extracted from the carbon bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for overwhelming plate @-@ epitheli@@ al Hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with recur@@ ren@@ al or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for overwhelming plate @-@ epitheli@@ al Hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ fixed dose as well as on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and intake must continue throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood image should be created prior to each gift , including differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place under recovery of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that are applicable to A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ - a hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies did not indicate that patients aged 65 years of age or over 65 years of age have an increased side effect risk .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ atine @-@ in @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose @-@ adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ atine @-@ in @-@ clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bor@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ us has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ us , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ous must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) , as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment should avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , during therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion is to be considered before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ pair@@ . occasionally , if this drug was commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible pe@@ eling of the reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised in front of the treatment pad to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservation .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed elimination with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is advisable when patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data is available in regards to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the coag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy require increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be used during pregnancy , except if essential and after careful weighing of the use for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised prior to the commen@@ cement of treatment to obtain advice regarding sperm preservation .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is transferred into breast milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed baby can not be ruled out .
the following table shows the incidence and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed - as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC drugs that were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasional ) of patients who received random@@ ised p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included sup@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
the clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity Grade 3 and 4 was similar to the phase 2 of the compound mono@@ therapies ( n = 16@@ 4 ) in phase 2 , except for neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences can probably be traced back to differences in patient population since the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre@@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the incidence and severity of adverse effects that could possibly arise in connection with the study medication ; they were reported to &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ized to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC who random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine .

for this table , a threshold of 5 % was set for inclusion of all events in which the reporting doctor considered a connection with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity , which were reported at ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( often ) of patients who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , included :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients that ran@@ - dom@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , included :
serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and trans@@ itory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were reported in clinical studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
from clinical trials , cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , intestinal perfor@@ ation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ous mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ term that ex@@ erts its action by interrup@@ ting long @-@ term consequ@@ ent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several targets by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ o syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cine @-@ hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ lins .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , single @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ous patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of survival compared to those patients with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received the test medication ( random@@ ised and treated ) in the treatment arm .
statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 212 patients ) in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm and worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in Pati@@ ents with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC demonstrated a medi@@ an survival time of 8,@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( In@@ tent to Chr@@ onic Population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non@@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separate random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study demonstrate that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel is similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

the resulting solution is clear and the stain@@ ing ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow without compromising the quality of the pro@@ - duc@@ ts .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and do not have weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , causing a quarter of the fats added to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with placebo in 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took all@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
no weight loss could be observed in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with step lab@@ eling , stu@@ d@@ ded , o@@ ily / o@@ ily stool , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ations ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where insufficient nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women and breast @-@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited the approval for the launch of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 body mass index ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ the@@ or@@ ic , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data for efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Chol@@ est@@ ase • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich individual meal or low @-@ fat diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adjusted .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnant women , in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed .
for the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick Val@@ ues ( international normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at for up to 4 full years , the levels of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ enes remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be recommended to take supple@@ mental mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vit@@ amine intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers , who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal in nature and are related to pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , since the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
the incidence of adverse events noted after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can result in possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported by or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage , there were either no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on tests on humans and animals , a quick re@@ formation of any systemic effects that can be traced back to the li@@ pas@@ times properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect consists in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bond to the active ser@@ ine rest of the ga@@ str@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
clinical trials were derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 are evidence of the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ the@@ or@@ ic , fatty diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those participating in study , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months .
the average total cholesterol in the Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value : 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value : 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value of 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value : 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist measurement , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients , which administered the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ bi@@ ated dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ cine group ) , could be identified which represented nearly 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular danger for human beings .
the regulatory authorities have to ensure that the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system , according to the July 2007 version as described in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application procedure , will be applied before and while the product is available on the market .
risk management Planning The holder of approval for placing on the market is oblig@@ ated to carry out studies and additional pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance activities as described in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan and thus to comply with the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) of October 2008 , as well as all other updates of the R@@ MPs , agreed with the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) .

if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk diet @-@ related companion symptoms ( see section 4 ) .
in order to get used to the new eating habits , start your first capsule intake with a cal@@ orie and fatty diet .
nutritional di@@ aries are effective as you can understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will likely be easier to change your dietary habits .
in order to achieve your target weight safely , you should set up two daily goals in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Take a diet low @-@ fat to reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional defici@@ encies ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to consult your doctor in advance if you are not used to physical activity . • Sta@@ y physically active during the intake and also after ending the intake of all@@ i .
• All i must not be taken for more than 6 months . • If you can &apos;t find any reduction of your weight after twelve weeks , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
you may need to stop taking all@@ i . • In case of successful weight loss , it is not important to just change the diet and return to the old habits .
• If less than one hour since the last meal has passed , take the intake of the capsule . • If more than one hour since the last meal has passed , take no capsule .
flat@@ ul@@ ence with and without o@@ ily discharge , sudden or increased stu@@ ds and sof@@ ter chair ) can be attributed to the mechanism of action ( see section 1 ) .
severe allergic reactions • severe allergic reactions can be seen in the following changes : severe short@@ ness of breath , sweat drops , rash , it@@ ching , swelling in the face , heart rate , circul@@ atory collapse .
29 Very frequent side effects These can occur in more than 1 of 10 people taking all@@ i . • flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) with and without o@@ ily discharge • Pl@@ ötz@@ licher stu@@ ff@@ lers • gre@@ asy or o@@ ily chair • Soft chair Inform@@ ing your doctor or chem@@ ist if any of these side effects ampli@@ fies or you significantly impaired .
frequent side effects These may occur at 1 of 10 people taking all@@ i . • stomach ( abdominal ) pain , • In@@ kontin@@ enz ( chair ) • wat@@ ery / liquid stool • increased chair urge • Know@@ ing your doctor or chem@@ ist if any of these side effects ampli@@ fies or you significantly impaired .
effects on blood tests It is not known how often these effects occur . • Incre@@ ase of certain liver enzyme levels • effects on blood cl@@ ot@@ ting in patients who take war@@ far@@ in or other blood @-@ dil@@ ating ( anti@@ coag@@ ulating ) medicines .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects is significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information information .
the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules and result in increasing fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the start of treatment , because at this time you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize nutritional requirements : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fatty diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended fat quantity evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a holding fe@@ tish , as you may possibly have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not use all@@ i after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the box . • Do not keep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow this . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transportation box ( Shuttle ) which is included in this package .

being overweight has an effect on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart Disease • Down@@ stroke • Cer@@ tified cancers • O@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis can talk with your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
lasting weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at a maximum per day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
the quantity of calories suitable for you can be found in the information below which indicates the number of calories suitable for you . • D@@ ue to the capsule mode of action , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional defici@@ encies . • You should try to gradually increase weight .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg a week , without fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Whe@@ ther physical activity &quot; means that you daily use only little or no stairs , work in the garden or do other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal per day , e.g. through 3 km of walking , 30 to 45 minutes gardening or 2 km of running in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat goals and to adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a nutritional diary with information about cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fet@@ al du@@ cks and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in conjunction with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended since there is insufficient information on the effects in this age group .
this means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the incorpor@@ ation of Alo@@ xi into the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting caused by strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ mal ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agonists , caution is required with the simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which incl@@ ine to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not to be used to prevent or treat nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five studied chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical trial there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , ri@@ ot@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience of using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least could be associated with alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the delivery ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ action relationships observed .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy with an al@@ ophthal@@ mic over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7,@@ 3 hours ) that was given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the studies with chem@@ ically em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ ar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical trials of indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the capacity to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of a pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron administered in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption Accor@@ ding to intraven@@ ous application , an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ y / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that once daily intraven@@ ous injection of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached 3 consecutive days , total text position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to that after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after one @-@ time indication of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function distur@@ b the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a slight relevance for clinical use .
10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and pro@@ long the action potential .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but because of the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for a unique application , the relevance of these results is low as for humans .
the holder of this authorization for placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for the placing of the drug in the context of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the authorisation for the use of the medicine prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug effective ingredient approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue has damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood ab@@ norm .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon with the efficacy of the reference drug was compared to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed does not suff@@ ice .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical studies .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was reduced to more patients than with the reference drug ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medication forms an immune response ( i.e. the body produces antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , are not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ peti@@ go ( skin infection caused by crust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( tears or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections prov@@ ably or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not affect this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 the skin surface to be treated may not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients were treated with placebo .
in the treatment of infected wound wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ tw@@ unden , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it has been noted that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( calibr@@ ated cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections prov@@ ably or presumably by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the sur@@ fac@@ et .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment out@@ weigh the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the launch of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and consider alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment must be carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as patho@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary infected wounds the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be taken into account if no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected position occurs after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that were reached in humans after topical application on reduced skin or infected surface wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 Once the oral dose of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients dose adjustments are not considered necessary when topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether the breast@@ feeding should continue / termin@@ ate or termin@@ ate the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go , the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy should be weighed for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most commonly reported side effect of irrit@@ ation at the date of delivery , which concerned approximately 1 % of patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle &apos; ri@@ bos@@ ome protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ ome P @-@ B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
by binding at this binding point , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , partially blocking P @-@ B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stell@@ a- interactions and preventing normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms should appear question@@ able , a consultation should be pursued by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily with oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on sc@@ aled skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice a day for 5 days to topical treatment of infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was performed in the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two doses of existing vacc@@ ination , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be reached only after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the two doses may lead to an end to the existing vacc@@ ination plan .
if a ref@@ res@@ her dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ ination of Twin@@ rix adults approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ination approved since 1997 with Twin@@ rix children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vaccine consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain adults identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month period and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix conducted a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the ambient temperature level was similar to six and a 12 month interval between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ation and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active substances , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the standardization plan for the pri@@ ori@@ zation with Ambi@@ enta consists of two doses of vacc@@ ines , with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a ref@@ us@@ oidal vacc@@ ination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ines may be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immuno@@ competent persons who have addressed a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination need a ref@@ res@@ ome vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with interference in the immune system , there may be no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody @-@ value after basic di@@ mm@@ ation , so that in these cases the gift of additional doses may be necessary .
since intra@@ muscular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal vaccine success , these injection routes should be avoided .
however , in cases of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or coag@@ ulation disorders , Ambi@@ enta can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously since it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life is administered with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mask m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rats vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it is necessary to assume that there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , nausea , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier Thi@@ eri@@ an and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 doses of vacc@@ inations were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s toler@@ ability was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ability on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the treatment of ambient rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects after a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % with the subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ u@@ ity was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the whole vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who got Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6,@@ 2 % in subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to that which was observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose regi@@ men .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the appearance of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per tape , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years , the dose rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
for the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the serum rates of serum ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the application of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ enta , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after the imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ months vaccine .
the immun@@ reaction observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen found in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it was demonstrated that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine scheme .
if the first dose of ambient rix in the second year of life coinci@@ des with the fresh@@ ening of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar serum and serum conversion rates similar to previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ding to possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , state charge release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as by bathing in contaminated waters .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete series of vacc@@ ines has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix ( although you / your child is not yet feeling ill or ill at the time of the vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any ingredient of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual dosing of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of vacc@@ ination with ambient rix .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix affects people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child is undergoing a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Speci@@ fy your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has recently vacc@@ inated / has been vacc@@ inated or immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been given or has been planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with ambient rix should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , Ambi@@ ani will not admini@@ ster pregnant women or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ extremely frequent ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the insertion point or redness • Mat@@ ty • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( more than 38 ° C ) • Acc@@ ade@@ dness • gastro@@ intestinal ail@@ ments
other side effects reported in days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10.000 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) are reported :
these include locally restricted or extended strokes , which can be it@@ ching or can be spher@@ ical , swelling of the eye and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness .

Ambi@@ enta is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data known since obtaining the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP noted that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ enta remains positive .
however , as Ambi@@ enta was launched only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug are limited due to the low patient expos@@ ures .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with an incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia @-@ mic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is administered - split by several individual doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study because am@@ on@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a fake medication , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ia may also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , fla@@ vor@@ ing , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ia was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this drug was proposed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 live @-@ days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ ger@@ mani@@ an form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) then an indication of the use when an@@ am@@ n@@ esis exists a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disturbances , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated based on protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake necessary for the growth and development of the patient .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose is sodium phen@@ yl@@ ated but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ x trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ ated but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
since the metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is carried out via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons occurred .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into the breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tic acid , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dosing occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
ru@@ chi@@ omet@@ rically seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rate atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram , between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical results .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ested , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alo@@ ga during the first year of life .
due to hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ ated but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) diagnosed disorders to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ x trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly irre@@ ver@@ sible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is known that phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine is formed .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were calculated after a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ ated but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after taking .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycle disturbances or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma on the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ ated but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma of the plasma were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no adverse effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swallow pills or patients with swal@@ lowing disturbances ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ y or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose is sodium phen@@ yl@@ ated but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ born infants , babies and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ x trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ ated but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ ated but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ pipes were exposed before birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain bark occurred .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tic acid , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
omet@@ rically seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rate atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of studies on ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram , mon@@ oso@@ dium poly@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly irre@@ ver@@ sible in the treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur .
after an or@@ ally single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after taking .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
this procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if laboratory studies are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the drug may go into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , post@@ ings of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disturbances and a worsen@@ ing of existing neurological conditions were observed .
if you notice one of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating an appropriate treatment .
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

30 If laboratory studies are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS evenly over the same single doses or via a stomach @-@ fi@@ st@@ let@@ oe ( tube that runs through the stomach wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al tube ( tube which is guided through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ ap of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Exten@@ ded a straight edge , e.g. a knife bridge over the edge of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of measuring spoon gran@@ ules out of the container .
angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in case of unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to the maintenance of the blood flow in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ in was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , the patient was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab und A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , angi@@ ox - with or without a dose of G@@ PI - was as effective in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox in terms of all indicators was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as for people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
September 2004 The European Commission issued a permit to the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the transfer of angi@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable Ang@@ ina / Non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency interven@@ ing or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is followed by a PCI , additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours after the PCI .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous injection of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ uring bol@@ us dose of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be performed .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before use and administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously before the application .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly .
in patients with severe kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second half @-@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT will re@@ consider the ACT 5 minutes after the second half .
in patients with severe kidney damage included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din @-@ bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of lower molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible coag@@ ulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are to be carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if most of the arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din , patients who undergo a per@@ kut@@ ane coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during treatment in principle bleeding .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din , monitoring the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be taken into account in order to ensure that the value after the treatment with bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din is again reached before the treatment .
starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ sis or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate ) it can be assumed that these agents increase bleeding .
in each case , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ ology parameters in each case are regularly checked for the combination of bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ dine with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te units or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
animal experiments are inadequate in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
in both the Bi@@ ochem@@ ru@@ din group and the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over the age of 65 often reported un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined in accordance with AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding as in Table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less frequent than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ omet@@ ri@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level of ≥ 4 g / dl with known hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information about side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
in both the Bi@@ ochem@@ ru@@ din group and the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over the age of 65 often reported un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less frequent than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following adverse events , which are not listed above , were reported in practice after extensive use and are classified according to system organ@@ classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din is immediately canc@@ eled and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ ge inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic center as well as in the ani@@ on region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din to thro@@ mb@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in its turn spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , serum from patients with serum @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) induced not to indu@@ ce thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te @-@ aggregate reaction in the past .
in healthy volunteers and patients , Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is demonstrated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
in the case of a PCI , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was given in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with inst@@ able ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or at PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly over the 3 arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or elevated cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively .
insulin insulin is very slightly different from insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting insulin insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot effectively process insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin secre@@ tion .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or for patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the launch of A@@ pi@@ dra across the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or applied sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously by continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal cavity .
due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced .
any change of the effect of action , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delays etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can draw a change in insulin requirements .
3 An insufficient dosage or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment scheme .
substances that increase blood sugar lowering and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , Dis@@ op@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates , and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effects of Symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ dine and reserves , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ gene regulation can be mitig@@ ated or absent .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin inj@@ ected into human breast milk , but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application .
listed below are the adverse drug trials known from clinical trials , grouped by system groups and ordered according to decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) .
cold sweat , cool and pale skin , ti@@ redness , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration difficulties , drow@@ sin@@ ess , excessive hun@@ ts@@ - , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
light pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is vers@@ ed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , can result in a list of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous glu@@ co@@ sis by a doctor .
after glu@@ ing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , insulin dose in therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing area of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glu@@ cos@@ es@@ hip effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ing effect , just like insulin .
insulin inj@@ ector has a twice as fast effect as normal insulin insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ es@@ hip effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post @-@ pran@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
when insulin inj@@ ected 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ pran@@ ic control was reached than with a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is turned in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with human normal insulin is obtained ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin dosage intake 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) before the start of the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin , 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) as well as in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin dose for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
