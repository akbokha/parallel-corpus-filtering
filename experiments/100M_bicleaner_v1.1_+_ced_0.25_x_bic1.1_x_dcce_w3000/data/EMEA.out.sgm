<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Reporting Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. twirl thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusion; • Bipolar disorder, a mental illness in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal elevation) alternating with periods of normal atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disturbances when the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for inhaling or the melting tablets used in patients, which causes difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, which are also broken down like Abilify, Abilify's dose should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this affects signal transmission between brain cells through" "" "neurotransmitters" "", "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to one another." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "Aripiprazole is believed to be a" "" "partial agitonist" "" "for the receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5 hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole works like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent as the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5 hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thus reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the occurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases suffering from increased unrest over a period of two hours with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol for over twelve weeks, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo to prevent reoccurring to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased unrest, with which from Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly greater in the symptoms of increased unrest than patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled sugar), tremor (drowsiness), nausea, vomiting, nausea, drowsiness (increased salivary), tiredness and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar disorder, as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who have predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were related to treatment with Aripiprazole, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in fast control of increased unrest and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the launch of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were related to treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be taken into account when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripivotzol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changes of an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no higher risk of suicide with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczeleric and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports on dyskinesia appearing during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or stop the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a mns, or unclear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all anti-psychotics, including Abilify, have to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripizprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was one of these studies, a study with fixed dose, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to deteriorating glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar Mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central potent drugs with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= poor ') metabolism, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolization.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before the adjuvant therapy begins.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6, together with Abilify, can be expected with a moderate increase in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine-Ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazl) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy due to the lack of data for human safety and due to the concerns raised in reproductive studies in humans, unless the potential benefit clearly justifies the potential risk for fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned to use dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazl has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parsonism, acathema, dystonia and dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripizprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients under ostezapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar disorder - in a controlled trial for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripizprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term study of more than 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazola was treated and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3,5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events related to antipsychotic therapy, and about their occurrence in treatment with Aripiprazole, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or deliberate acute overdoses of Aripiprazole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without a death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazole has high plasma proteins.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder over the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity with the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergic and the histamine H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the administration of Aripiprazl in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks at healthy volunteers, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on the Nucleus caudatus and in the plaza.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) in 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of responder patients who had a response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- DepressionsRate-Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olang-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, less patients showed a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active controlled monotherapy trials for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12 Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients suffering from a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in part did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period of more than 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase, Aripizprazl was superior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bipolar reversal, mainly in the prevention of a reversal in mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for the dehydrogenation and hydroxylogging of Aripiprazl, the N-Dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination-down time is approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole with extensive metabolisation via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= poor ') metabolism through CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenia patients with no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics showed no evidence of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional precautionary studies, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans, so that they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal cycle toxicity (Lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose of humans) and an increase of adrenal cordial carcinomas and combined adrenal rinds (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the average stewards state exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose or the 16- to 81times of the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- Aripiprazole found in the human gall found no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study more than 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys and lie far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of 3 and 11 times the mean Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="145">In order to increase the resorption and to minimize the variability, an injection into the deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended by bypassing of obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be given depending on the patient's clinical status, taking into account the medicines already used for maintenance or acute therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify Melting tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with aggidity and behavioural disorders that were different to schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazl injection solution, patients should be observed in terms of extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution are not present for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczeleric and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports on dyskinesia appearing during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of mns are high fever, muscle stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and cardiac arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar Mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazole, in a study, in which healthy volunteers Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) was used as one-time intramuscular and the same time Lorazepam (2 mg dose) were intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">CYP2D6 'bad' (= poor ') metabolism can result in a joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseinase inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before the adjuvant therapy begins.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) were intramuscular, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazole after allying.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Aripiprazole injection solution more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazola was treated and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazola was treated and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term study of more than 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripizprazole was treated and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases of CPK (retatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3,5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Adverse events related to antipsychotic therapy, and about their occurrence in treatment with Aripiprazole, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disturbances were the Aripiprazole injection solution with statistically significant significant improvements in aggidity / behavioural disorders associated with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder, as well as aggidity and behavioural disturbances, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms regarding the agility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- Reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean recovery from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggidity, a similar efficacy was observed in terms of the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced patient count.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) in 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of responder patients who had a response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (orally) and haloperidol (73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg-DepressionsRate, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (orally) showed a significantly higher rate of return, which was at 34% in the Aripiprazol- (orally) group and at 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olang-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients suffering from a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in part did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a 74-week extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase, Aripiprazl was superior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bipolar reversal, mainly in the prevention of a reversal in mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours of intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazole AUC is 90% greater than the AUC after administration of the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiprazl injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure (AUC), which were intramuscular 15 and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous application there were no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which lay in 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with Aripiprazl (orally) for safety spharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicological significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans; therefore, they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal-loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose of humans) and an increase of adrenal-state adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose or between 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which lead to expositions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The effectiveness of Abraxane was examined in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, about three quarters of which had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in the sole dose or as monotherapy) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, in the main study 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane were treated to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="270">Considering only patients treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to worsening of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before starting treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that Abraxane was not more effective in patients in whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel and that it does not have to be given to other medicines in contrast to other paclitaxel in order to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a permit to the European Commission of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed the first-line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for the standard anthracycline therapy (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophens &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or serious sensory neuropathy during abrasion therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy Grade 3, the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies have been carried out with patients with impaired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of the renal function (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which could have essentially other pharmacological features than other formulations of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment can be initiated and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no longer abrasion treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neutrophiles increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte count increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with abrasion.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a cardiotoxicity associated with Abraxane has not been proven, cardiac occurrences in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">In case of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in patients following the application of Abraxane, these can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constiptive methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women at childbearing age who do not practice effective contraception, except the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is essential.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women at childbearing age should use a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm conservation, because the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (frequent), which can affect the transport efficiency and the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">Listed below are the most common and most important events of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of abrasion in the pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most noticeable hematologic toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of the patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 contains the side effects that have occurred in combination with the gift of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100); rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, elevated phosphor in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, bloating, tongue burn, dry mouth, painless gums, loose stools, eyelashes, sores in the abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of musculature, neck pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness is very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in relation to a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal correlation has been established with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimcrotubules active ingredient that promotes the integration of the microtubules from the tubular indices and stabilises the microtubules by escaping their depolysis.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated through the gp-60-albuminrezeptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs due to the albuminous protein (SPARC) protein acidic rich in cysteine.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two armed non-interlinked studies and 454 patients who were treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without pre-medication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line treatment are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to terminate baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Active ingredient exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to the IV administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multi-phase way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a wide-ranging extravascular distribution and / or soft tissue binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30 minutes infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values following a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane dose (43%) compared to a solvent-based paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion was 4% of the total dose of 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching no-renal clearing.</seg>

<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender, and total disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin values can be observed in one patient over or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this haemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose should be reduced by 25%.</seg>

<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic kidney failure, the upper limit of the hemoglobin concentration of hemoglobin should not be exceeded in patients with chronic kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoiesis-stimulating active agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the dose of epoetins when the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the anemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of increasing high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which is not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">For the assessment of the treatment efficiency of epoetin alfa, a 2-3 weeks delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin-response should be taken into account (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the application of recombinant erythropods should be based on a benefit-risk weighing involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">Patients who are provided for greater electro-orthopedic surgery should, if possible, investigate the cause of anaemia before beginning of epoetin-alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a larger electrical orthopedic procedure should have adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially for the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epoetin alfa, an increased risk for post-operative thrombotic / vascular occurrences may exist for patients with an output equivalent of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy were returned when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7,5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose should be adjusted to the increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In-vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of interactions between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in terms of hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, cerebrovascular events (cerebral thrombosis, cerebral infarction), transitory ischemic attacks, deep venous thromboses, pulmonary thromboses, retunal thromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common adverse effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular occurrences (see section 4.4 and Section 4.8-General) was observed in patients under treatment with erythropods.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can cause thrombotic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations.</seg>
<seg id="434">The technologically recovered epoetin alfa is glycosilicate and in relation to the amino acids and carbohydrate part is identical to the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of local patients.</seg>

<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood again normalized or decreased at least 75% compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosis therapies) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most Aclasta side effects occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Zoledron acid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion site and osteonekrosis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides information for doctors who prescribe Aclasta to treat osteoporosis, which contains indications how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">April 2005 The European Commission issued a permit to the company Novartis Europharm Limited to approve the launch of Aclasta in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="587">Patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include: • Conditional charges in pregnancy and nursing women • The requirement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment for postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">Intravenous infusion of 5 mg of Aclasta is recommended once a year for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Paget, Aclasta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating the Paget disease.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the Paget with Aclasta a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure adequate calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget, equivalent to at least 500 mg of vital calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by giving paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal dysfunction (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin-clearing &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children under the age of 18, since data is missing for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the start of the therapy (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of zoledron acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia may develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure adequate calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget, equivalent to at least 500 mg of vital calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be considered before using bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dentistry.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental interventions, no data is available, whether the interruption of bisphosphonates treatment reduces the risk of osteonekrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical review by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by giving paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The frequency of atrial fibrillation reported as severe side effects was increased in patients who received Aclasta (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">Osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) were the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%).</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronic acid was associated with kidney function disorders, which were expressed as a decrease in the renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinin clearing (measured before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were in a clinical trial in osteoporosis over three years comparable between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with apclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), were up to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Paget-Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplemental sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study on preventing clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Paget Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of zoledronics in a large clinical trial were reported on local reactions to the infusion site such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonekrosis in the jaw region, especially in cancer patients, reported on osteonekrosis (primarily in the jaw area) reported with bisphosphonates, including zoledronics, were treated.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients showed osteonecropsis in the jaw area of a patient treated with Aclasta and placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdosing, which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalicaemia, a compensation can be achieved by giving oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged 65 to 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) or BMD T-Score for the femoral neck ≤ - 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric curves were significantly reduced over a period of three years, as well as the frequency of one or more new spinal fractures after one year (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared with placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a consistent effect over three years, resulting in a reduced risk of hip fractures in one by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on the lumbar spine, hips and distal radius compared with placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the femal neck by 5.1% and the distal radius of 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic ridge were taken.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the retention of the trabecular bone structure in comparison with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in the serum and the beta-C-telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were measured in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta reduced significantly by 30% compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the output value for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the output value for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the output value for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Overall mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the placebo-treated group compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased the BMD at all time points compared to placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="636">Compared to placebo treatment, the Aclasta treatment led to an increase of BMD by 5.4% at the overall intake and 4.3% on the femoral neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of Aclasta compared to the once weekly donation of alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 with radiologically proven, above all light to moderate severe morbus Paget of the bone (average serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.6-3.0x age-specific upper normal value when taken into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledron acid compared to taking 30 mg of risedronate once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month main study (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 patients treated with the follow-up study, the therapeutic response in 141 patients treated with aclasta, compared with 71 patients treated with Risedronat, could be maintained at an average duration of the follow-up phase of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous fusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma gas rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1% after 24 hours followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life periods t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination hour t ½ γ at 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and the excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance is independent of the dose of 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to a 30% decrease in Zoledron concentration at the end of infusion but had no effect on the area under the curve (plasma concentration vs. time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance of metabolized substances metabolized by cytochrom-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Zoledron acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the Zoledron acid correlated with the creatinin clearing, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin clearing, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal function disorder up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the zoledronic acid requires.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe renal dysfunction (Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letalous intravenous single dose amounted to 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and in rats 0.6 mg / kg of body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">Studies in dogs were given single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was administered in rats by taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion of 0.25 mg / kg, administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks (a cumulative dose equivalent to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">Long-term studies with repeated use in cumulative expositions that adequately exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure occurred toxicological effects in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, and intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spontaneiosa in the metaphysical metaphor of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, findings that reflect the pharmacological, anti-resorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity of dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledron acid is a substance that is called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the bone of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens produced from androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the Paget's disease, bone reconstruction is done too quickly, and new bone material is set up unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by restoring the bone structure back to normal, thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus giving the bones a strength again.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">Please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently been taken / used, even if they are not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is particularly important for your doctor to know if you take medicines that are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>

<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg, which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an infusion into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">Since Aclasta has a long period of time, you may need another dose only after a year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your blood after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget, Aclasta can work longer than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If the administration of Aclasta was missed, contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before stopping the treatment with Aclasta If you consider the termination of treatment with Aclasta, please notice your next doctor's appointment and discuss this with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion often occur (in more than 30% of patients), but are less frequent after the subsequent infusion.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days following the administration of Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Reporting Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (particularly overweight patients) that cannot be adequately adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with sulfonylic resins or insulin, the current dose of the sulfonylic resins or insulin can be retained with the start of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonylic resins or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in triple therapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylic resins, in addition, they received up to 3.5 years either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in lowering the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar values were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg dosage.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triple therapy study, the effect of an additional dose of Actos for the existing treatment of metformin and sulfonylic resins decreased by 0.94% while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin were reported to decrease the HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in those patients who additionally took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypocthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin, Actos should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit to transport Actos across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequately adjusted with insulin and where metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treating with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be aware of signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be aware of signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outgoing study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced makrovascular disorder was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in cardiac insufficiency reports, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT-level is increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels will be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper stomach upset, tiredness, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision as to whether the treatment of the patient continues with Pioglitazon should be guided by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are present.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases connected to fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a minor reduction of the middle hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrite (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the therapy with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction in hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematoglobin by 3.1-4.2% and hematoglobin by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sulphonyl resin or as a two-part combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a reduction of visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thiazoldindigenes, including pioglitazone, a occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between taking Pioglitazon and the incidence of macular edema, but the prescription doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report on disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be taken into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive Study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is deprecated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or drug dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker, and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC from Pioglitazon by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC from Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulin resistance resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the parent animal is reduced, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not estimated from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and refraction index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon ALT-Anstiege was more than three times the upper limit of the normal range than placebo, but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylic resins.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced macular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo, if pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its launch, it has rarely been reported about congestive heart failure under Pioglitazon, but more often when pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive trial conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">While taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon appears to act as an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be demonstrated that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose enhancement in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazon versus Gliclasia as monotherapy was continued for over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect was left (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the onset of the therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclasia).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled trial for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequately controlled in spite of a three-month optimization phase with insulin, were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone the mean HbA1c reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin quotient compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as insignificant, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL- cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the total plasma matrix glycerides and free fatty acids in comparison with placebo, metformin or bile acids and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison with placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazon, while lower levels of metformin and Gliclasia were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the triglyceride levels, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both with an effect on the triglyceride level as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups that received up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment either pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentration of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma can usually be reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to effectiveness is roughly three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies it has been demonstrated that pioglitazone does not affect the pharmacokinetic or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was mainly found in the Fäzes (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma elimination time of unaltered pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral clearance of the parent substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlarging with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulin resistance resulting in the creation decreases and increased insulin resistance of the parent animal is reduced, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (for male and female rats) and tumours (for male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazoldindions led to increased frequency of colontumors.</seg>

<seg id="823">The fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive Study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study of two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with pioglitazone or gliclacidal were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies more than 1 year, Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin quotient compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the triglyceride levels, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, this with an effect on the Tryglyceride level as well as the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target of its primary endpoint, a combination of the total mortal, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary revitarisation and reascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with taking Pioglitazon.</seg>

<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia can, however, be progressively developed: • Easy hypoglycemias can be treated by oral glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape-sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juices. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a given aid or by glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="1188">During Phase 3 clinical trials, slight abnormalities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with febuxostat (3,5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before starting the Febuxostats and in the subsequent course (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwas not carried out interactions studies on febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibiting can lead to a rise in theophylline level (inhibiting the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen was associated 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in febuxographic exposition (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorothiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without a dose adjustment for febuxostat or the other active substance required at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study conducted with subjects 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily showed a moderate 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an Antazishower containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delayed the absorption of febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a reduction of the CMAx by 32%, however, does not cause significant changes in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data concerning a very limited number of exposed pregnancies do not include side effects of febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Experimental studies do not include either direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>

<seg id="1222">Data from the open extension study phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the serumharnate acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of gout attacks, so that less than 3% of patients in the months 16-24 needed treatment against a conspection (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not require treatment against a gpost).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the number of gums, which resulted in 54% of patients experiencing a complete disappearance of the gums up to 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µU / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with febuxostat (5,0%) and also in patients receiving allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy volunteers, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose is dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses of 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in the AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the CMAx amounts approximately 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">As alendronate and vitamin D3 are already being used separately in medicines approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to verify the efficacy of ADROVANCE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who only took alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also submitted data suggesting that the alendronate dosage contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose required to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pains of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (diarrhea), ulcers (ulcera), ulcers (ulcera), trickered abdomen (bloated abdomen) as well as acid clasps.</seg>
<seg id="1283">ADROVANCE cannot be used in patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It must not be applied in case of esophagus disease, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium level) or for patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of ophageal irritation and associated side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should only be swallowed with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day's rise. • Patients should not chew the tablet or let the tablet dissolve in the mouth, as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract except pyloroplastic, only be given under special caution (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as ophagitis, ophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal lines, were reported in patients under the intake of alendronate (partially these were severe and required hospitalisation).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal irritation, and patients should be informed about the occurrence of symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrosternum pain or new or worsening heartburn the medicine and pick up medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious ophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or take it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with alendronate no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenal ulcera, including some severe and with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonecropsis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regimen were administered intravenously bisphosphonate.</seg>

<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately treated before starting the treatment with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">For this reason, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronat before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, alendronate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus this can result in graft rejection or an increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes of formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Section4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains preserved.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advantee should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level measurements (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advantf, the Tacrolimus valley mirrors should be controlled prior to the conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4 systemic exposure, measured as a mirror, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus valley mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advantf to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate follow-up phase.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments can be required later, as the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus can change during the stabilization of the patient after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplantation prophylaxis of transplant rejection The oral advocate therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advantf must be converted a transplant recipient of twice daily doses of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advantee, so this conversion has to take place in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressants to advanf once a day, the treatment with the oral dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation must begin the prophylaxis of transplant rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation For adult patients who are converted to advanagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients - although there is no clinical experience with advanf in lung, pancreatic and colorectal transplanted patients, was in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in colorectal grafts in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups Patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood levels in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of Tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum carcinomas, a calculation of the creatininee and supervision of urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Change from Ciclosporin to Advantf When switching from a ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy caution is advisable (see Section4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases under the help of full blood-tacrolimus-level controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion from Prograf to Advantf, Dosage Adjustment, Changes of immunosuppressive therapy or while using substances that could change the blood-blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advantee is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the blood level in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the Talmirrors of Tacrolimus in the blood in the first time after liver transplantations are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney transplanted patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplantation receivers, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects that may occur in the result of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes of formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be treated with other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation advanf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">To prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplantation receivers and transplant recipients in childhood, no clinical data for the retarded formulation advanf are still present.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, taking herbal supplements containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other herbal remedies during treatment with Advantee (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful observation of the Tacrolius concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases Prograf was able to observe a chamber or septum hypertrophy known as cardiomyopathy which can therefore also occur under Advantf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who are taking Tacrolimus symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered states of consciousness, convulsions and visual disturbances, should show a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advantf hard capsules, retarated, lactose are included, special caution is required in patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose-malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or decrease the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels with simultaneous administration of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and to adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of the gastrointestinal metabolic rate.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; hence, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines metabolized by CYP3A4 may affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Because tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase the hormone exposition, it is particularly cautious when making decisions about contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal testing have shown that tacrolimus can potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and prolong their half-life.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in combination with the treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high binding on erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysible.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Active mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects At the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus may be mediated by its binding to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cellular jaws.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calcium-dependent inhibition of signal transduction due to the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a certain series of lymphoma genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on the T-helper cells, furthermore the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies corresponded to observations in the major studies in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant receivers.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multi-center trial with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported that received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliteral syndrome, was less common in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the case of patients treated with tacrolimus, in 21.7% of cases the incidence of bronchiolitis was compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be converted to Tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients converted from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was increased after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the treatment plan patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the incidence of bronchiolitis of obliteral syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreas transplantation A multicenter trial with oral prograf was performed on 205 patients who underwent pancreatic and kidney transplantation at the same time receiving a randomised tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Intestinal transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after colorectal transplantation revealed an updated survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low hematocrite value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of the metabolism of corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion is mainly done through the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">For stable patients who were converted from Prograf (twice daily) to Advantf (once daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) related to the total daily dose, the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advance is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (one caused by the lack of factor VIII, congenital blood coagulation disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advocates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but produced according to a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced into the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently, so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the drug was used to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of Advents in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood cantiseptics was "excellent" and "good" respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advance (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advance may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, according to the location and the extent of the bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events the factor VIII activity should not fall under the indicated plasma gas (in% of the standard or I.U. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, an appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-value lives.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The speed of the administration should depend on the patient's condition, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of Factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by means of modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of inhibitors is correlated with the magnitude of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositions and anamnestically known inhibitors development, after switching from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, reoccurrence of (low titres) inhibitors has been observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there is no experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), all with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of inhibiting inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10.000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected decrease in the blood coagulation factor VIII-Spiegels was performed postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VIII- Spiegel in the plasma and the clearing rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE, 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (≥ 150 days) showed only one patient after 26 exposure days with ADVATE a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, in none of the 53 pediatric patients with age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%), a FVIII inhibitor was detected after previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients from a ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE treated patients with inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the appearance of urticaria, pruritus, skin rash and increased number of eosinophiler granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP still evaluated the benefit-risk weighing as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore the CHMP has decided on the basis of the ADVATE security profile, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited distributed the Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company accepts its application for approval for the use of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, bones or soft tissues (tissues that connect, surround and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexim is a Adenovirus, which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot cause infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the p53 gene, which is not defective in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient, in which Li-Fraumeni cancer occurred in the area of the lower abdomen, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP examined the company's answers to the questions presented to him, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initial submission documents, the CHMP created a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin's injection in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is not harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not notice the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "endorsed-use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and young people aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with or without food with a glass of water.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clamped.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be followed by constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy levels were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms which were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When examining all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who took Aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in the patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who had lost lost atadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), mouthiness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolency (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) against Desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients suffering from constriction glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular disease including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyrophy) or a hemorrhagic stroke (stroke caused by brain hemorrhage) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the Company SP Europe to approve the launch of Aerinaze across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is swallowed in whole (i.e. without breaking, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied in children under the age of 12 due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible to keep and should not be continued after end of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days as long-time application can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine over time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolide, urgotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva, which are perorally or nasal as swollen Rhinology (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient's collective and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not tested in patients suffering from kidney or liver function and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or increasing headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be discontinued at least 48 hours before the implementation of dermatological tests, as antihistamines may otherwise have positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">As part of clinical trials with Desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered additionally, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether or not Desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In-vitro studies, Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP2D6, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies of animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstricting properties of pseudoephedrine, aze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a presumption that can lead to impaired mobility or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental attention, cyansis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lethal procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult microtion, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breath failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, perspiration, nausea, vomiting, pre-cordial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (mouthdry, pupil starvation and dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include blocking the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-Selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was found at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause other sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis took part, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under one monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerobic tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the floating balance weight of Desloratadin, 3 hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the scope of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it has been noted that four subjects abloratadin are poorly digestible.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the allying gift of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was for exposure to an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional precautionary studies, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin cannot detect any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudo-ephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicology studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin, it was rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chase, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspicuous liver values has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg of lyophilisate for inhaling (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg-melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies on seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness has been measured by identifying the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrant, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to verify that the body uses the syrup, the solution for inhaling and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were considered, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius led to an average decrease in the symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies at Urticaria, the decrease in symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% compared to placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Desloratadin, Loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the European Commission for the transport of Aerius across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of abloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to previous disease progression and can be resumed after the end of symptoms and resuming.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness, which can lead to impaired mobility or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth dry (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical trial with 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse effect was headaches, this occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with abloratadin and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, which administered up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine times clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibiting of the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-Selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses in which desloratadin was administered daily for over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the appearance of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces stress caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was ascertained for further forms of urticaria as the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of aetiology, is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be prospectively recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histamine stimulation is a causal factor in all urinary diseases, it is expected that in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, in other forms of urticaria, this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of quadriums at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of itching by more than 50% was observed at 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patient demographs were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients had a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not been identified yet, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In-vivo, Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data exists which support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis of anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabolise desloratadin and experience higher levels of substance (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which is moderately metabolized, is identical to that of children who metabolize normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or saccharase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were also administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group in the Aerius Sirup group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials of adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study involving adults and adolescents with a dose of up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between the age of 1 and 11 who were eligible for antihistamine therapy received a daily intake of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of lost atadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in the desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinically-pharmacological study on adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was used for ten days in adults, no prolongation of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">In an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not harm the psychomotor function.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinically-pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not result in a strengthening of alcohol-induced performance impairment or an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adults and young patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the resulting seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of quadriums at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The dissemination of this restrained phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasus (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which may be suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of about 120 hours.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially told the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company accepts its application for approval of Aflunov for the prevention of the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied in adults and older people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus which could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerges, which can easily spread from man to person because humans have not yet built up immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the inoculation of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "body foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to produce antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this trunk.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane surface of the virus was cleaned up with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognizes as a foreign body), purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you require further information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution to inhaling, but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked which antiviral medicines the patient has taken before, and the likelihood of the virus to be addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice a day, taken together with 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of agregase after body weight is directed.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase reduces the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml after 48 weeks under Agenerase, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who were previously treated with protease inhibitors, the viral load enhanced with Ritonavir was just as effective as other protease inhibitors following 16 weeks of treatment:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase joined together with Ritonavir for a stronger anti-viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common Agenerase side effects (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may also not be used in patients with St. John's wort (an herbal supplement for treating depression) or drugs that are just as degraded as Agenerase and are detrimental to the blood in high concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take Agenerase have the risk of cerebrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonecrosis (loss of bone tissue) or an immunodeficiency syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The CHMP's Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of agregase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who did not take protease inhibitors has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "" "" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited the approval of the launch of Agenerase across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pretreated adults and children from 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules should be given to the pharmacokinetic booster of amprenavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution for intake is 14% less than from Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amprenavir twice a day together with 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenera Capsules are applied without the addition of the addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenera combined with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4, due to the lack of data for harmlessness and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be carried out with care in patients with mild or moderate liver function, in patients with severe liver function disorder, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the event of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing reduced liver function including chronic and active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver function disorders under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin and simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of Agenerase with lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who use this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma gas levels of ammonavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, patients should therefore be supervised on oppiate symptoms, especially if also low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be removed in duration 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases, to which therapy medicines were needed which are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In haemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemoarthritis are present.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), HIV-infected patients develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is adopted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecropsis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic latitude are not given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the Cytochrome P450-isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be given along with medicines, whose agents are mainly metabolised using CYP2D6 and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma gas levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already taking St. John's wort, the amblown-up mirrors and, if possible, verify the viral load and decompose the carob.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, whereas CMAx is reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered twice daily in combination with amsprincaviar capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg of Amprenavir were twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% decreases if amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered twice daily in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with didanosin, but due to the imaginative component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenue of didanosin and asgenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">For this reason, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dosage adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended since the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapine may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, be careful because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma gas.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to a rise in the plasma concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193% and thus an increase in side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin along with asgenerase, a reduction in the dosage of Rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma piping of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg Ritonavir with 200 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-ratio) once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may cause interactions if they are used together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be supervised by toxic reactions associated with these medicines when used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on data from other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as asgenerase, as it can come to resorption disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anti-convulsants known as an enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifipin, nifedipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous use of aggenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) more than 7 days ago, the fluticasonpropionate plasma level increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% -confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticoids, unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in the plasma gas must be expected at the same time administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this drug with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirror is recommended since the plasma concentrations of cyclosporin, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased by ammonavir simultaneously (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase cannot be applied together with oral Midazolam (see section 4.3), while at the same time Agenerase is advised with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma gas quality of Midazolam to 3 to 4-fache.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be supervised on oppiate symptoms, especially when administered also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation on how to adapt the amprenavir dose if amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional dose of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods of contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactating rats, amprenavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether amsprincaviar passes into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study on pregnant rats, which was administered by the connification in the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding period, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not impaired by the administration of amprenavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Agenerase's harmlessness was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely resulted in a treatment stop.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are related to the use of Agenerase or another medicine at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the adverse events listed below are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors did not receive 1200 mg of Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring under the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and fetal fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocerebral fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">In 113 antiretroviral agents treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine for a median duration of 36 weeks, only one case (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 treated patients under Amprenavir were 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Indavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a median duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapilous nature, with or without itching and occurred usually during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteonecropsis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg of Agenerase twice a day together with low doses (grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were very common in patients who received aggenerase together with low dosed rideonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate adequate supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyprotein preamplifiers with the result of an inmature, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% hemming concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range between 0,012 and 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans has not yet been defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-pretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other Ritonavir treatment schemes with protease inhibitors - the described mutations are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates being evaluated genotypically.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33I, I50V, I54L / M / V, Q58D, D60E, I62A / I, I84A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamenormalavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients treated with protease inhibitors occurred in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance tests based analysis systems can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / F, I62V, V82A / C / F, I84V, and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir and a reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with the genotypic data for assessing the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret results of resistance testing.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinosaur, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-pretreated patients who failed to establish a limited cross-resistance against Lopinavir and saquinavir (three of 25 isolates), Darunavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), Darunavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), called saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a seeding treatment is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations which may adversely affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of Agenerase's efficacy in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open trial (600 mg twice daily) with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and Nuklegaosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low dosed rideonavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-supremacy of APV / Ritonavir in terms of time-adjusted average change from the initial value (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-leak threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of unbleached Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was used three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase of the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the benefit of" "" "unbleached" "" "agregase was to be taken into account when optimizing therapy with PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the medium duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased for CMAx by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound ammonavir which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>

<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumors (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is a lower likelihood of responding to Imiquimodine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not examined for the treatment of actinent keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lipstick.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the application of Imiquimod for treatment of actinic keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratose on the forearms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application, therefore such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or decline after the treatment with Imiquimodine.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical trial reveals that patients with more than 8 lesions reported a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, Imiquimod cream should be used with care in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies do not produce direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or post-natal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were not obtained after a one-time or after multiple topical application, no recommendation can be given during the breastfeeding period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most frequently shared and probable adverse events related to Imiquimod's application in the studies with three-week treatment were local reactions in the treatment of cowberries (33.7% of patients treated with iodquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and probable or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream in the related side effects include complaints at the application site with an incidence of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The basalioma patients treated with Imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probably or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream in the context of side effects, were a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with iodquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical studies of phase III with Imiquimod cream treated patients with actinic keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical signs assessed according to the review plan show that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials, three-week treatment with Imiquimod cream often led to local skin reactions including Erythem (61%), erosion (30%), excretion / slipping / shed (14%) and edema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the review of clinical signs, this study showed that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream very often lead to severe erythemes (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe snoring and reduction (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was observed with an incidence of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental unique oral intake of 200 mg Imiquimodine, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could cause nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The most clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous liquid release.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were detected after topical application of iodquimiodine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies could be demonstrated that the efficacy in reference to a complete healing of the prepennices in an Imiquimod treatment is clearly superior over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the patients who had treated with Imiquimod, the patients were completely healed; this was in the case of 20% of the 105 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with Imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% from 161 with placebo-treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">Imiquimod's efficacy in five-phase application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficielle basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years of data show that about 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Imiquimod's efficacy in one or two treatment times of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four week treatment period, has been studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic lesions within a 25 cm2 interconnected 25 cm2 area on the uneasy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods (35 / 128 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2231">Patients with paediatric patients usually do not appear in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed in the three weekly use during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and betruten 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when applied in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life time was about 10times higher than the 2-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod after topical application on MC-diseased skin was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superimposed basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for the dermal application for four months resulted in no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice with dermal administration in three days a week did not induce tumors at the application site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimodine has only a low systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for humans is regarded as very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerve).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, the movements difficult, decreased lung volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be supervised by a physician who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be administered in a hospital or clinic with revitational devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly examined the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured (by investigating its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five Aldurazyme lowered GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measure of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known and where necessary to update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients who receive aldurazyme regarding reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. to approve the launch of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be done by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be raised every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or hepatic insufficiency has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with durazyme may develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which revitational facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 trial, it is expected that almost all patients form IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding the resumption of treatment after a longer break, the risk of hypersensitivity reactions has to be cautiously cautiously after an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the onset of infusion with drugs (antihistamines and / or antipyrities) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not include direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data is available to newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed with Aldurazyme during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme, observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension with a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment period of up to 4 years, are reported in the following table following the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing stillness and facial edema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable drug effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly severe follow-up form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment to a seroconversion, with a more severe follow-up in patients aged 5 years (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to early retirement from the study), there were no detectable antibodies in 13 / 45 patients, including 3 patients, in which there was never a Serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in urine, whereas in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG was detected in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic Laronidase activity in vitro, which seemed to impair clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme treatment lies in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed into lysosomes, most likely via mantis-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which revealed the entire spectrum of diseases, the majority of patients were of the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and go 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FEV and the absolute walking distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme every week for another 3,5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in the lung function and the capacity shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the GAG mirrors was found in the urine (µg / mg of Kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined end point, which summarizes clinically significant changes across five efficiencies (expected percentage of normal FEV, range in 6-minute walk, range of motion of the shoulder joint), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a decrease in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was carried out in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe follow-up form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks because of increased Gag- mirrors in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) was observed after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form had a normal mental development speed, whereas the older patients with severe follow-up form had limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosage schemes were carried out at the GAG-Spiegel in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available every year, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on the conventional precautionary studies, toxicity in a unique gift, toxicity in repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another medicine against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body). • advanced or metastatic non-small "lung cancer that does not attack the squamous epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy for patients who have previously not been treated in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, an "anti-emetic" (medicine against vomiting) and liquids should be given before or after the administration of cisplatin (in order to prevent dehydration).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose hemorrhage changes or when certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, removed or reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetremixed thus slows the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from splitting.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of pemetremixed into its active form proceeds more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active period in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study to 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin experienced an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, Alimta's average survival was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in whom cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells during the administration of Alimta showed longer survival times than with the comparison medication.</seg>

<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3 that are applicable to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if in patients after 2 dose reducti- a hematologic toxicity or non-hematological toxicity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so- fort at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies did not indicate that patients aged 65 years of age or over 65 years of age have an increased side effect risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a creatine-in-clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose-adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatine-in-clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper borilirubin limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; 3,0-fold the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-times of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to the immunosuppression and pemetremixed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophus has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophus, thrombocyte count and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-haematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with pemetreous must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous intake of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs), as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with pemetremixed treatment should avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life time for at least 5 days before the therapy, during therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">In patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, a drainage of the effusion is to be considered before the pemetremixed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 Several cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with pemetrepair. occasionally, if this drug was commonly administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>

<seg id="2404">Since no data is available in regards to the interaction potential with NSAIDs with a long half-life like Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be avoided with pemetremixed for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy require increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetremixed in pregnant women, but as with antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetremixed should not be used during pregnancy, except if essential and after careful weighing of the use for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to pemetremixed, men should be advised prior to the commencement of treatment to obtain advice regarding sperm preservation.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared with placebo in 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">No weight loss could be observed in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily stains at anus, flatus (winch) with step labeling, studded, oily / oily stool, finish oily secretion (rotations), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It may not be used in patients who are treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may not be used in patients who suffer from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (where insufficient nutrients are taken from the digestive tract) or cholestase (liver disease), and in pregnant women and breast-feeding mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited the approval for the launch of orlistat GSK in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 body mass index) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypotheoric, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only minimally resorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Chronic malabsorption syndrome • Cholestase • Pregnancy (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich individual meal or low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli, because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnant women, in order to prevent possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and ciclosporin, a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma level was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">For the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick Values (international normalised ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat for up to 4 full years, the levels of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotenes remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be recommended to take supplemental multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure adequate vitamine intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a single dose Amiodarone, a limited number of healthy volunteers, who received orlistat at the same time, observed a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal in nature and are related to pharmacological effects of the drug, since the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rarely (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of adverse events noted after the launch of orlistat is unknown because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can result in possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obese subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported by orlistat overdosage, there were either no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on tests on humans and animals, a quick reformation of any systemic effects that can be traced back to the lipastimes properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect consists in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bond to the active serine rest of the gastran and pankreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials were derived that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies on adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 are evidence of the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypotheoric, fatty diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change in the body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a proportion of those participating in study, which have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the biggest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average total cholesterol in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value: 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value: 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (initial value of 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (initial value: 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist measurement, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolised orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolised orlistat in plasma could only be sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients, which administered the minimal systemic resorbiated dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-Formyl leucine group), could be identified which represented nearly 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety spharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular danger for human beings.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended since there is insufficient information on the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5 hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies on 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the incorporation of Aloxi into the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in severe emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by strong emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon, patients with anamnestimal obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required with the simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT interval is extended or which incline to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi is not to be used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five studied chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose Palonosetron and a Steady-state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inhibitors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, doxorubicin, riotavir, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience of using Palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which at least could be associated with aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the delivery (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-action relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis is probably not an effective therapy with an alophthalmic overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 micrograms or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-life 7,3 hours) that was given intravenously on Day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study a total of 667 patients who received strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with chemically emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials of indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical studies, Palonosetron possesses the capacity to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarization and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the ECG effects of a palonosetron administered in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to intravenous application, an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the whole dose range of 0.3- 90 μ y / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that once daily intravenous injection of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron reached 3 consecutive days, total text position (AUC0- ∞) was comparable to that after a one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after one-time indication of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, palonosetron as an unchanged substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous injection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function disturb the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions, which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a slight relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of preclinical studies evidence suggests that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and prolong the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded to the 30x of the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but because of the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined by humans for a unique application, the relevance of these results is low as for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the authorisation for the use of the medicine prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same drug effective ingredient approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference drug" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue has damage, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood abnorm.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) has been introduced which stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon with the efficacy of the reference drug was compared to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed does not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was reduced to more patients than with the reference drug; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medication forms an immune response (i.e. the body produces antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), are not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of Impetigo (skin infection caused by crust formation) and small infected infirmations (tears or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used to treat infections provably or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not affect this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18 the skin surface to be treated may not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected wound wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in Hautwunden, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it has been noted that Altargo is not effective in the treatment of abscesses (calibrated cavities in the body tissue) or of infections provably or presumably by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the surfacet.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment outweigh the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the launch of Altargo across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and consider alternative therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or serious local irritation by the use of reapamulin ointment, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment must be carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as pathogens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary infected wounds the efficacy of reapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be taken into account if no improvement or worsening of the infected position occurs after a 2 to 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that were reached in humans after topical application on reduced skin or infected surface wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 Once the oral dose of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the mean retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% reapamulin ointment on reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients dose adjustments are not considered necessary when topical reapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of reapamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding should continue / terminate or terminate the therapy with Altargo, the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefits of the Altargo therapy should be weighed for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was the most commonly reported side effect of irritation at the date of delivery, which concerned approximately 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of reapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub-unit of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the Bindungsstelle 'ribosome protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosome P-Bindungsstelle and the Peptidyltransferase Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding at this binding point, Pleuromutiline inhibits peptidyltransfer, partially blocking P-Bindungsstella- interactions and preventing normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of reapamulin at least some infection forms should appear questionable, a consultation should be pursued by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of reapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% reapamulin ointment was applied daily with occlusion on intact and on scaled skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% retapamulin ointment twice a day for 5 days to topical treatment of infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed in the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake on humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of reduced skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retina inulin IC50.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of reapamulin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were performed over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rats microkernel test for in-vivo examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby a up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application to 200 cm2 of isolated skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats, oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to ≥ 3-times of estimated human exposure (see above)), developmental toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity were noted.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the authorization for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in Module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation (Version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the licensing agreement is committed to carrying out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan as described in Version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the RMP, agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Medicinal Products for human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">When the ointment goes out of sight on one of these surfaces, wash the site with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile bandage or a gazebo, unless your doctor advised you not to cover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic zipper containing 5, 10 or 15 gram ointment, or in an aluminum bag containing 0.5 g ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two doses of existing vaccination, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be reached only after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the two doses may lead to an end to the existing vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines work by" "" "teach" "" "the immune system (the natural defense of the body) as it can defend itself against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "foreign" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccination of Twinrix adults approved since 1996 and the vaccination approved since 1997 with Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccine consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix contain adults identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six-month period and a 12 month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, Ambirix conducted a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the ambient temperature level was similar to six and a 12 month interval between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maturation and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active substances, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the priorization with Ambienta consists of two doses of vaccines, with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refusoidal vaccination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the corresponding monovalent vaccines or combination vaccines may be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) - are the same as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons who have addressed a Hepatitis A- vaccination need a refresome vaccination as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory in non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of formalin-activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemodialysis patients and individuals with interference in the immune system, there may be no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody-value after basic dimmation, so that in these cases the gift of additional doses may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intramuscular injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal vaccine success, these injection routes should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in cases of thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorders, Ambienta can be injected subcutaneously since it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix in the second year of life is administered with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined mask mumps-rats vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it is necessary to assume that there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, nausea, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier Thierian and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 doses of vaccinations were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, Ambirix's tolerability was compared to that of the 3-dose-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturability on a calculation basis per vaccination dose Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the treatment of ambient rix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in subjects after a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix had pain, compared to 63.8% with the subjects vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matuity was comparable to per proband (i.e. over the whole vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects who got Ambirix compared to 36,2% in subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and maturation was low and comparable to that which was observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the appearance of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalin-activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per tape, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years, the dose rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rates for anti-HBs were 74,2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was worthless, the serum rates of serum (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the application of the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-old one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">At least 24 months after immunization with Ambienta, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after the immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunreaction observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to that after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalin-activated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen found in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- to including 15-year-olds it was demonstrated that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of ambient rix in the second year of life coincides with the freshening of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 haemophilus influenza vaccine type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar serum and serum conversion rates similar to previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after resuspending to possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete series of vaccines has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccines Ambirix (although you / your child is not yet feeling ill or ill at the time of the vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any ingredient of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itching skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. • If you / your child has a serious infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usual dosing of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of vaccination with ambient rix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix affects people who suffer from severe blood clotting disorders, under the skin and not into the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defense, or if you / your child is undergoing a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient, so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambienta is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data known since obtaining the first permit for placing on the market, the CHMP noted that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambienta remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, as Ambienta was launched only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug are limited due to the low patient exposures.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with an incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia-mic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is administered - split by several individual doses to meals - swallowed, mixed with food or administered via a gastrostomy (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because amonaps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a fake medication, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia may also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, flavoring, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevents high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "ammonia was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because due to the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this drug was proposed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifested in newborns (within the first 28 live-days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-germanian form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first months of life) then an indication of the use when anamnesis exists a hyperammonia encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disturbances, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated based on protein intolerance and the daily protein intake necessary for the growth and development of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose is sodium phenylated butyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornix transcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk of the formation of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylated butyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since the metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate is carried out via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is unknown; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats at high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), a slowdown of neuronal multiplication and increased loss of neurons occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a decreased number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted into the breast milk in humans, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least 56% of patients had at least one undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactic acid, heavy hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdosing occurred in a 5-month-old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound, conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Ruchiometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrate atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that sodium phenylacetyl glutamine can be produced for each gram, between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infested, and the disease itself led to death in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analoga during the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylated butyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn at postpartal (but within the first month of life) diagnosed disorders to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the ornix transcarbamylase deficiency), recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly irreversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">Phenylacetate is known that phenylacetate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys with glutamine, whereby phenylacetyl glutamine is formed.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were calculated after a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, the hemoglobin metabolism and with liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous dose of sodium phenylated butyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected 15 minutes after taking.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea-cycle disturbances or haemoglobinopathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was no phenylacetate in the plasma on the next morning after nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylated butyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma of the plasma were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate had no adverse effects with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children who cannot swallow pills or patients with swallowing disturbances) or via a gastrostomy or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose is sodium phenylated butyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborn infants, babies and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornix transcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylated butyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylated butyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-pipes were exposed before birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrate), lesions in the pyramid cells of the brain bark occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactic acid, heavy hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Ometrically seen phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrate atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, monosodium polybutyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly irreversible in the treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an orally single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected 15 minutes after taking.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the durability, the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0.95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory studies are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in case of unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (an anomalous measured value in the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to the maintenance of the blood flow in patients with angina or heart attack and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angioxin was compared with a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient was often used a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent a closure) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as Abciximab und Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without a dose of GPI - was as effective in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks, or revascularization) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, angiox in terms of all indicators was as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to biometrudin, other hirudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as for people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that angiox is an acceptable replacement for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">September 2004 The European Commission issued a permit to the Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the transfer of angiox across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable Angina / Non-ST-lift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency intervening or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initialdose of angioxin in patients with ACS is an intravenous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is followed by a PCI, additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours after the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous injection of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an alluring bolus dose of angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted drugs should be carefully mixed before use and administered intravenously intravenously before the application.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with severe kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subject to a PCI (whether with Biometrudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is under 225 seconds, a second half-dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT will reconsider the ACT 5 minutes after the second half.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with severe kidney damage included in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the biometrudin-bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after completion of subcutaneous administration of lower molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against hirudine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a disturbance of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible coagulation disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are to be carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when biometrudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if most of the arterial puncture points occur in PCI patients under Biometrudin, patients who undergo a perkutane coronary intervention (PCI) may occur during treatment in principle bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with Biometrudin, monitoring the INR value (International Regised Ratio) should be taken into account in order to ensure that the value after the treatment with biometrudin is again reached before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolysis or thrombocyte aggregate) it can be assumed that these agents increase bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In each case, the clinical and biological hemostaseology parameters in each case are regularly checked for the combination of biometrudine with thrombocyte units or anticoagulants.</seg>

<seg id="2921">The following adverse events, which are not listed above, were reported in practice after extensive use and are classified according to system organclasses in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with Biometrudin is immediately canceled and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains biometrudin, a direct and specific thrombinge inhibitor, which binds to the catalytic center as well as in the anion region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Biometrudin to thrombmbin, and thus its effect, is reversible because Thrombin its turn splits the binding of Bivalidatdin-ARG3-Pro4 slowly, thereby regenerating the function of the active center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, serum from patients with serum-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) induced not to induce thrombocyte-aggregate reaction in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and patients, Biometrudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is demonstrated by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the case of a PCI, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin should be given and infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was given in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with instable angina / non-ST-lift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either prior to angiography (at the time of randomisation) or at PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, were spread evenly over the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG- changes or elevated cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angiography.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1-year endpoint for the total population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography or in front of the PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or in front of PCI 1 A ACUITY haemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperito-neal, intraocular hemoglobin level of ≥ 4 g / dl with known hemoglobin level, reduction of hemoglobin level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemoglobin level, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on fourfold and triple endpoints of a randomized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients with a perkutan coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">As a peptide, Biometrudin is expected to pass a catabolism into its amino acid components, followed by re-evaluation of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through Thrombin is not effective due to the loss of his affinity to the catalytic center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination is done in patients with normal renal function after a first order process with a temporal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on the conventional precautionary studies, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals in repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks in exposure to 10-faeces of the clinical Steady-state plasma concentration) was limited to unsurpassed pharmacological effects.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneously into the abdominal wall, thigh or upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin insulin is very slightly different from insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting insulin insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot effectively process insulin, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin secretion.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin ulisin or any of the other ingredients, or for patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the launch of Apidra across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or applied subcutaneously by continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the effect of action, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delays etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can draw a change in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances that increase blood sugar lowering and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Disopylline, fibrate, fluoxetine, propoxyphene, propoxyphene, salicylates, and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effects of Sympatholytics such as beta-blockers, clonidin, guanethidine and reserves, the symptoms of adrenergic antigene regulation can be mitigated or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin injected into human breast milk, but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it resorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the adverse drug trials known from clinical trials, grouped by system groups and ordered according to decreasing frequency of occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration difficulties, drowsiness, excessive hunts-, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Light podystrophy Is versed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, can result in a list of lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous glucosis by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After gluing, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially skeletal muscles and fat) as well as inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin-lulisin the effect occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus, insulin dose in therapeutically relevant dosing area of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glucoseship effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosing effect, just like insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin injector has a twice as fast effect as normal insulin insulin and achieves the full glucoseship effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post-pranic glycaemic control is reached, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">When insulin injected 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-pranic control was reached than with a human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control as with human normal insulin is obtained (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin dosage intake 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the start of the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin, 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin dose for 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
