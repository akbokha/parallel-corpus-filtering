package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more easily available .
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions you can find in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose settings extensions ... Open the map tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard settings modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that possibly more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes if available .
the module view filter ( also called Fol@@ der filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M @-@ tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the displayed website . as default starts the display with the root node of the document , example : document@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents a further view for objects using the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of presenting ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size is the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be detected , even if it lies far below in the folder hierarchy . thus , &amp; FS@@ View may be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and label settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over view color mode can be either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or mapping of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is present at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angle should be used ( whereby , therefore , display error caused by restrictions on the character of the tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle .
in case of representation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps the rule should be observed that the area is proportion@@ ately to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target is not always maintained . it will be drawn to indicate the ne@@ sting of the entries , and that frame will need space that is no longer available to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
how to divide the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here it is always advantageous for the in@@ scri@@ bing and avoiding space losses by frame , that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu entry view . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; used as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get designed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the module image gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the picture gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can set the appearance of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
to display the file name of the image , specify whether the file names are displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
to view the file size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , you can determine if the size of the images below the thumb@@ nails is displayed in the gallery .
in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save HTML File &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; file selection , specify where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the sub@@ folder to include the sub@@ folder , you can set the sub@@ folder to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
copy original images with the original images to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
using the commentary box comment section , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original images .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides you with easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
you can find the media playback for the navigation pane in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Windows navigation pane or with the short@@ cut short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click in the navigation area of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
change browser detection adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; add that you can change browser and operating system recognition for single domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser , change browser detection in one of the following options .
changes the code in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject access with browsers based on Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the default browser detection is used for all pages of the website you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of the information on the browser and the operating system in the individual .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works complete in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with significantly more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens to search for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ ti@@ sed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvements .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; attempts to make the det@@ ox of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also download the digi@@ cam ; homepage to learn about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to get involved is to log in to the developer mailing list . instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all picture folders .
later , you can add as many folders as you would like . &amp; digi@@ kam ; you will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ Library . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folders . &amp; digi@@ kam ; see each sub@@ folder as an album . no image is changed . during the search of the folder you get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ st recur@@ sively the library path in all its depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders unless it is in hidden folders . this can be done by inser@@ ting one point in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change the photos by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can be in &amp; digi@@ kam ; set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use my albums and my keyword list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , you can also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow sections .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk device . the connection can also be realized via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
g@@ Photo@@ 2 supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . see this link for a complete list of supported cameras .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am . Ex@@ if support is required by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the thumb@@ nails . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might be unable to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the nic@@ est things to do is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach a common modular structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier to complete &amp; digi@@ kam . by writing a small module to complete a function , the changes made in &amp; digi@@ kam .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strings with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
moving and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ dable , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or into another application window . the only limitation is that one picture cannot be placed in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type sel@@ ector allows you to highlight the most common files : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame works only if it is shown in the symbol view . which fields can be displayed , you can configure in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; edited are stored in a single alb@@ um@@ tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album im@@ porting images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
in order to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it down . in the then appearing menu you will have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy multiple photos in the same way . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to give you information about this collection . to access the album properties , you have to right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name . the collection you use will be used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete collections from the collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View Album sort by date .
the buttons el@@ dest , average , new test@@ ers : these set the date on the oldest , the newest picture or the section of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead .
when you first entered an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and set it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As Album preview ; additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included only in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a short while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this in which you can re @-@ create all thumb@@ nails in the Extras menu .
information on each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information these are , you can change the settings edited ; set up the albums page and adjust the preview images to your preferences .
the thumb@@ nails have auxiliary windows , which appear . if you allow the mouse cursor to rest at a moment above a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the section introduction to the main window shows such help window .
photos and tags allow you to organize your pictures as you like . image processing shows your photos and allows you to make a number of improvements on these . you can get all the features possible using the preview or menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 Picture Edit ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... select . in the editing section , you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos . image editing allows you to view and edit your photos .
it may occur that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File menu . for this , and how to customize them to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs there may be problems with the metadata included in the image . some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . this information is lost from EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Tur@@ ning . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right click the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it is moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del In case you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or finding a search .
when a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ ste@@ quot ; to fold so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs as well . in addition , the keywords are re @-@ imported when the data is lost ; the images are noted .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or click on an existing keyword and then select new keyword . if you click on an existing keyword , after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the sub@@ stit@@ ch of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and del@@ eting . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there . then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to move the keyword . a keyword can only be once in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and selecting keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
to select another photo as an album symbol , select the picture with the right mouse button and select as Album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to be able to exploit the functionality with keywords , you must first have your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want with a keyword , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword , draw and drop there . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select keyword from the context menu .
you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can use a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you right @-@ click the context menu of the photo and select Rem@@ ove from the key menu . the menu only displays the keywords attached to the photo .
the time beam view shows a time @-@ based adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved by this hist@@ ogram . to select a time@@ frame , you only have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection box , which indicates the time unit . this displays all the associated images in the main window .
in the bottom of the box you can enter a title and save your selection . then this appears in the list below .
cover all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more in the future .
when you click on it , the filtering will be deleted and all the pictures will be displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search that always filters what you entered as a search criterion . after you have saved it , it appears filters in the list .
if you are happy with your choice , press OK and search will be performed . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit search , the search form will appear again with the search information you entered . if you select as an advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for the search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the context menu .
the Advanced Search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are displayed in line , separated by operators . an option can be added to this list using search group / search group or deleted from it .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar one . if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : free @-@ hand ink sket@@ ch : draw a fast sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ tite ; find the matching pictures . also here , a sw@@ ell@@ value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can zoom in or zoom out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates will be filtered and displayed .
in the bottom of the box you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ destination .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lamp in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image data formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em illuminated console from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated console and open its window . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ kam window , you can quickly open the illuminated console with L Extras .
from the preview window , you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right corner of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select preview from the tool@@ bar and perform Zoo and Im@@ position operations on one of the pictures , then these are also executed with the other image . you can therefore compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly locate from a picture series . if you use pairs of pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas to the same . now use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it in the right @-@ hand side . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the illumin@@ ating table , e.g. F@@ 4 File Edi@@ ting ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to combine visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each section you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to swing the visible area of the image , you have to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will show the same image area .
zoom as well as in other views . just use the zoom @-@ controller under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images if you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos leads a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up your pictures , find , protect , and reuse photos . we focus on the process for digital photographers that have &amp; digi@@ kam . we look at the download , ren@@ ame , delete , group , review , review , refine , archive , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exported contents that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data via data . in accordance with your definition , metadata is data that provides information about or a documentation of other data which are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your machine then you will need to find a certain photo no longer . if you do not even know how many photos you have then use certainly not &amp; digi@@ kam .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough pictures then you will be using sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc .
professional photographers have other requirements , such as version@@ ing the photos , archiving , work sequences , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % working files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or deriv@@ ative picture .
we also recommend to save the metadata option in &amp; digi@@ kam . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do this , &amp; digi@@ kam , provides them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , since you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an assessment to each picture . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in the next work .
now let &apos;s with keywords , keywords , as you are often called in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import kat@@ alog@@ ised images from a different source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam . automatically build the tree for you or place the pictures in the right place . modi@@ fying the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by pulling a sub @-@ tree onto another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while it pursu@@ es the sub@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you &apos;re sure to be interested in how your photos arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I &apos;m telling you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! one starts dreaming of having associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the lab@@ eling has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others who consider your photos is the title possibly more important than the picture itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him about the motive that moved you to understand what you understand .
it &apos;s fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a lab@@ eling for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . you can even export it to a selection of images . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell chec@@ ker .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already moving with light speed .
the possibilities of explo@@ iting the ge@@ olo@@ cation are already un@@ coun@@ table and will become even deeper in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with ge@@ o @-@ ge@@ o . &amp; digi@@ kam . you can also export k@@ ml files that you can use with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information came from &amp; digi@@ kam , as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title ( syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : Emplo@@ ye@@ e photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for vendor ) : use the provider field to identify who works the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which you provide the picture to others .
it is very important to fill in the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ators can delete or modify this in the picture . for private individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ kam , will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : disk failures , disk failures , current sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of memory media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . this kind of loss is the same that can happen to you even with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we deal with problems with the so called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics showing the reasons for data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these precau@@ tions need to be dealt with and you may not take longer than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers via gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot more reliable .
75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection , they are used by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
burn slowly with a good recorder to high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ety format . then read the data again to check it . likewise , you should copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read the media .
your manufacturer &apos;s specifications include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the failure mechanisms of hard drives on this topic : disk Study
in short : dis@@ cos are longest if you operate in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temper@@ s , the error rate increases dramatically . some of the errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT indicate the immediate im@@ pending failure .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices don &apos;t matter much , this is different in devices with computer chips and high speed processor . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed motherboard and other defects . so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against power peaks is a surge protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy slots and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector ridge .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection then you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the right connected devices .
as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that even all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms . some manufacturers also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power ou@@ tage occurs . some models allow them to continue working until the current exp@@ ires . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of current problems with the cost of avoiding it . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your machine is protected .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amounts of data .
however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and in the big companies there is a backup and a distributed memory in the offer .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing about it is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain un@@ discovered until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk errors on low levels and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % on work@@ station systems . in not@@ ebooks already the proportion of the@@ fts amounts to 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to less damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings of fundamental physical borders . it is meant that while the technology develops further there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are moving towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even though this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t blame anybody else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . therefore , secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like installing your operating system , the exchange of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you do your backup on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash hits you if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aviation accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention means always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above , a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential f@@ use : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time that such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
back up important images directly after saving them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
topics : metadata , stored in the image file IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original storage , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ finding images and metadata , copying the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature , you need to consider all that is being told today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to assess the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . at * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in M@@ B@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs and dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rpm if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market , so you shouldn &apos;t use it any more .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color allocation for hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open raw format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already provide D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will also use it at some point .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive a copy of your photo , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as noted above , the raw format can be changed . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it all together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization supporting a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard links and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edit , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a subtle editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again , edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut from other programs under certain circumstances .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them to web galleries only , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Add a Photos to an album , you will find a description how to add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is established , a fer@@ al indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file association are displayed on the camera for each file , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page features properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an item or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the metadata tab shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or the image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the photos were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the button download and then download Sel@@ ected . the Sel@@ ected button is download as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these images have not been downloaded yet . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , you will of course only download the new images .
when you use the All Download or Sel@@ ected button , a dialog appears to be able to select the target album in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums , like normal folders . then select the album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam . download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All button . if you just want to delete some , you must select it first and delete selected Del@@ ete selected .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a &amp; digi@@ cam ; album downloaded before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera body completely , you should do so using the camera bed , as this is much faster .
the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used again after the photos from the camera were deleted . this can result in double fil@@ en@@ ames if you upload photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two affect the data on the author in the standard Aut@@ ori@@ Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the relevant entries from the Ex@@ if information will be copied into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish a different date format than the default format , for example , in the editing field you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % % d % H : % M : % S . turn on the Date &amp; Time option . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ kam . used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . its settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ osan ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the point of time recording to perform an automatic rotation during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , it lets &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in its original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date that the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam , this can be used to automatically load sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data side@@ bar , you can read what information your camera might have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn this option on . to do so , use the Advanced button and select the option Date @-@ based sub@@ mit@@ es at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button download . select then upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ kam . you , where the images are to be uploaded . a folder sel@@ ector dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a generic term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude and can be displayed on a map . the data can be calculated by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can click a browser to open the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam , users wanting to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good to record the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to store these data in the GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script which works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the wild@@ cards compiled by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to set up the Settings menu in the Settings menu . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; note if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardization and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s status : this field should include the professional title of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if this is for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here since they offer the image to others &amp; quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam . this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ kam .
save image labels as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor rests in the main window above a file . depending on the option selected , this information will appear or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify what file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in one &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folder that has none of these extensions has been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
you can set these settings if possible . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size loading quot ; should you only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar when you use image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image . these colors are defined here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling refers to the fact that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia to the closer explanation .
with the P@@ NG setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because P@@ NG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data requires more time for training and un@@ packing . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the option of comp@@ ressing TI@@ FF files , you can switch the compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect image quality since the Def@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it evol@@ ves quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings .
the default acceptance is that all green pixels are the same . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor react with sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a mesh pattern in output . this option draws the picture a bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 mesh patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . default is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the default it is the Sp@@ itz Li@@ ghts , so the parts of your images are burned in , because of the inability of your camera to capture the spi@@ der lights in the settings . the setting colors release some unusual results , as they indicate the top lights in various rose tones . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red ones . and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the re@@ construct option , you get the possibility to set a level . here a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the digi@@ cam ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial data that come from the color @-@ filtered image sensor , which have many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour @-@ construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for gra@@ dient correction since it is done during the rough conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from a colour space to translate into the other is that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior issues when an image is opened in image editing / color management module with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ der Res@@ et the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam ; examine this folder during startup .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to leave . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures color does not manage the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color t@@ apping or g@@ amma correction . at present , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma doesn &apos;t correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given from one device again . this is very useful before printing pictures as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for them for what purpose . unfortunately not on the models of Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam can support ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and they will be uploaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules will appear as new entries in the main window and in addition you will find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check fields turn the metadata into or out , which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display .
the camera features show a list of all currently supported cameras on the left . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button automatic detection , which attempts to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . currently , Seri@@ al , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage is supported .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , where you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn it on .
check out whether &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can manually set camera models and port . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it will be displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it all here .
with the Option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; View images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; for del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections clearing a photo and del@@ eting an album , you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be implic@@ itly supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without questioning . otherwise , you will need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display the greeting image of &amp; digi@@ kam ; supp@@ ress when starting . this acceler@@ ates under certain circumstances the start process of &amp; digi@@ kam . .
setting Bei@@ m Start for new photos comp@@ els &amp; digi@@ kam , to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extended the starting time of &amp; digi@@ kam . if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ kam , you know if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ kam ; use to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the Tool@@ bar Settings window . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview and selecting the item Display / Edit .
image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam . you may not be part of your distribution .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of image processing are changing your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save the file or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
you should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it . you can save this with file Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by restoring or restoring the image processing button in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last saved .
virtually every action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can undo by editing undo or restore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and write C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the back or restore button in the tool@@ bar a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be rever@@ ted or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can zoom in and zoom in the picture in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select En@@ large factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can change this in the edit dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam .
if you want to print the current image , you can select image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . whole image pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export Assistant . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation file , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the margin .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC fields so you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply change to the next picture , the cap@@ tions will be saved .
in addition to the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows an evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 .
the evaluation is written to the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keywords and a selection box with the keywords used before in this &amp; edited ; session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given search word . you can easily restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further simpli@@ fication for the input of keywords in a series of images . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding tick boxes in the tree . all keywords in an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if you select multiple images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to have a selection with a keyword , please read the section keywords .
the page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar with their album , - date , keyword and search view is used . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right , only the intersection of these two will be displayed .
you can also draw and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears that asks you if you want to put the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . you have been selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off among Settings Vari@@ ous .
if you have created and created a rule and state that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry you are looking for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
you can , for example , specify an advanced search on all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group@@ ing button . the options will then look like this :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / Tut@@ orial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly got it to &amp; edited ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that colors that come from your camera or scanner will have predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish in the web to those of your digital dark@@ room .
if the subject comes to color management , then everyone would like to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . additionally , links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed choices to make you get the desired result .
if your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image issues are by email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and life is so easy for everyone , why should you use a different color space and have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB limits compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces .
do I have to cal@@ libr@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to cal@@ libr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB is running on s@@ RGB . if you work as a color space of s@@ RGB , then you have to use either your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve an image in most cases . therefore , please use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , compare , Automatic Comp@@ are and Con@@ trast Enh@@ ancement from the menu Con@@ duc@@ er Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the fluorescent values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed out .
this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ance factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity canal becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the same number of pixels produces very good results , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle at a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a re @-@ j@@ usti@@ fication of all values in between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited since a color space is worked with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you can be far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , then your options for correc@@ ting are better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side both the original picture and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original white balance , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel on this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images that most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow alignment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance . this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result displayed in the white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons store as and load exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved in a text file and rel@@ o@@ ad later .
the Pre@@ ferences button res@@ ets all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed .
you can set the coding depth for each color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better for high @-@ quality images . this encoding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for use of color profiles can be used to rate the chapter color management .
another important tool is to find tone @-@ value correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always needs the same error and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a sol@@ ation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a channel filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas were darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the sol@@ ar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment ultimately generates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar power effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity amounts to 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ire ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ire ; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeat the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ance of the photo . you can experiment the different color levels of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem : a too large satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you only need the area of the slide for the purpose described here . concrete the three slider below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three slider are cli@@ cked into and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the slider to see how the image changes .
on the right , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left hand side are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a digital camera the linear diagram is mostly dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ ges .
the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input of shadows , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a light image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p Level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input value is automatically read@@ ju@@ sted for all shadows , medium and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the hist@@ ogram application for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ lay Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels in order to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result .
below is an example of the adjustment of the entries applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right side :
modi@@ fying channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most meaningful . for pictures with large ranges of constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a c@@ rank@@ shaft to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker expressions and that the associated image pixels become darker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blu@@ e- and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ lay Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels in order to display over@@ exposed pixels . if found in more than one channel , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam channel bl@@ ender ; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel bl@@ ender is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender for image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first notice how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and output . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed compared to your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are on the right : controller for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to preserve L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness even if you change the corresponding color components . this is particularly convenient if you also use the option Mon@@ ochro@@ me since the channel bl@@ ender then is THE tool for creating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color . color space consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose diamond pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the color .
save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting you can save for later and load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ lay Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels in order to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image under ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with orange lens filters . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red liner filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar light rays at the time of the day . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ ate filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow liner filter . this is the most natural color setting and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and middle tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and re @-@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ pad . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; use tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper tex@@ tual defect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to be seen . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool frame can be added a decorative frame to be added a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . the image is surrounded by a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , sh@@ kant@@ et surrounds it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns .
width : speci@@ fies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into an image at any location . this also works in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you chose for your text can be changed by pressing the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool template you can apply a template over a picture .
the menu Image Tem@@ plate apply in image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum comp@@ ressing ( 9 ) to dimin@@ ish the file size of the template . if you want to add your template , send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select here the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view mirrors the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder updates the thumb@@ nail of the sten@@ cils automatically .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller size : this button res@@ umes the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you have to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . then take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to use the template on your image . the image will then automatically adjust the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . actually sharp@@ ens it not a bit , it works rather psych@@ otrop@@ ic . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ our and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for custom@@ ization .
images without focus and most digit@@ alized images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process colors with only minimal differences to one color point . this in turn results in sharp edges a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras typically require more after sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images a camera is often used in internal sharpen@@ ing . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a field of sharp@@ ness already during reading the picture . if you disable it , you will get the control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the focus of sharp@@ ness . you can call this with the menu entry Kor@@ rigi@@ eren Schär@@ fen .
you should be careful with this because the results do not work very naturally : sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but intensi@@ fies the noise . generally , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft mark with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried at first . an increase in the radius or the amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the sharp@@ ness mask too strong , h@@ ash and the impression of gr@@ ates will produce close to sharp edges .
the radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should best sharp@@ ens images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference @-@ amount . thus one can define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter . thus areas with a soft change between the sounds are exemp@@ ted from the shar@@ pen and hence beauty defects in faces , heavens and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the sharp mas@@ ked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ ell@@ value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool re@@ focused a picture through improvement of sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted dischar@@ ging filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to get a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focused ; in which it revers@@ es the default . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna filtering . re@@ focused mostly achieves better results than blur@@ red mask .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also depends on the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filters : an increase of the noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . however , if the smoke filter is too low , the image quality is very bad .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß is cra@@ g . this is most often caused by a previously executed blur@@ ring filter . in most cases , you should let this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow when you select great values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the save as and load buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will thus be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the cutting , color and intensity adjustments on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not visible immediately , but later leave some unpleasant arti@@ facts .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
theoretically , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always create art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Wiener filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharpen@@ ing in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regulator smoo@@ thes the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the colour ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can set this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different preferences as starting points to simplify restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a smooth smoo@@ thing over the image . whereas larger values are mainly smoo@@ thing and details are sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should get details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing should be changed afterwards . please note that the detail maintenance should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction depen@@ dency .
directional depen@@ dency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly across all directions , while a value close to 1 is only smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD rou@@ ches will produce a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best eliminated at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor via all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
repeat : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is tra@@ vers@@ ed . normally , here is 1 or 2 .
angle step@@ width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never t@@ aller than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal . it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to om@@ it it .
the buttons store as and load exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very quick at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Canc@@ el .
below you can see how to remove picture errors with little art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was taken in Guatemala City by an analog camera . as you see , there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a poor film shift during the trip .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove spots and other arti@@ facts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor screws from camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings .
radius checks the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller errors adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing that the filter looks forward to detect light density changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again .
edges : check the edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without lo@@ osing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve the image . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ bl@@ ers of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically more severely rou@@ gh@@ ed .
atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of the phase adjusting atten@@ u@@ ation . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high , h@@ ash and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter appear at the edges . it can remove smoke tips and is the recommended method for it .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for reducing noise you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is labeled with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to sof@@ ten the soft mark with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; Artef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons store as and load exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very quick at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious cinem@@ at@@ ography on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo that was scann@@ ed with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image can be viewed under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ cam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera close to eight . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially with high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &apos; quot ; bright pixel quot ; in a photo with a dark photo sub@@ trac@@ ting method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file into the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will detect automatically the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you connect the dark photo directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark and will automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all preview areas .
select an area to see the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ cut : an average of the neighbour pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all the defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo formats , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
however , it also has disadvantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also use center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise there are no sharp@@ ness effects caused by motion .
with the large exposure area of today &apos;s felt and color and gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation to an image that has been made without this filter . the tool vi@@ gn@@ etting correc@@ tor applies the transformation with a c@@ enter@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of lumin@@ ance atten@@ u@@ ation at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 , reduce the density to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree .
lumin@@ osity , Con@@ trast , and G@@ amma Settings : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options .
if you want a more subtle adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the color gra@@ dation ; image processing from the colour gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect , but fla@@ ws at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth gra@@ der correc@@ ts the remote corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated .
generally , this value controls the strength of distortion of second degree . with negative values , barrel @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion of the fourth dig@@ its . this value works more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; has the reverse character of the General parameter .
zoom : this value re@@ comp@@ iles the image size and creates a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
light : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start .
the spher@@ ical or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as the first . if you re@@ trim a picture and then perform a ton @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be obvious to fal@@ seh@@ ood .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line . move it to an important location , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the barrel / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu Trans@@ form cro@@ pping from image processing or through the zoom regulator of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs , such as pictures from the front , frame and paintings , is to adjust the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the spher@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is achiev@@ able under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 IR video , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters of film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option of fo@@ aming film gran@@ ulation if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos , as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter film gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of films the manufacturers mix large silver bas@@ kets of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film gran@@ ulation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular view specially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
the regulator can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , to ISO 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting .
the upper el@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brush is better for large images . smooth checks the smoo@@ th@@ ness or , from the other side viewed , the magni@@ fic@@ ence .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smoo@@ ther 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbohydr@@ ate . the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very well with pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art by means of distortion . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art by means of blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a focal point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking photos , camera .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the light tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by random shifting of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : find the colour bas@@ ins in the picture and blur@@ red them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation anytime with the button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses an algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing to hold an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain drops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the drop drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can move it by mirr@@ oring or turning it into the correct orientation . the tools for this can be found in the Trans@@ formers &quot; menu .
bubbles are definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you zoom into a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can the missing information be recovered or gu@@ essed ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job here . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
the size change tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality then try to blow up the tool .
many picture editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below :
maintaining the aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the original image aspect ratio will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it has to be set higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and Lo@@ ad are used exactly for this purpose . each insertion for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example of a photo by magni@@ fying a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to assemble a picture . to cut a photo you have to create with the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle when you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The C@@ tr@@ l button for image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview area you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved .
in the tool Accor@@ ding to the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait format or landscape format . in portrait format the larger value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned .
the tool Accor@@ ding to aspect ratio , uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max . relationship button to set the area to crop up to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool after aspect ratio saves his settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values in depen@@ dency on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflects the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the co @-@ operation help enable you to show help in order to better assemble your images . these aids are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third element , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden divide at all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides more liquid auxiliary lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spi@@ ral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ rate rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow on this way .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to guide the eye into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also diver@@ ge from the golden spiral mentioned above . its verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that unlike the harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als can be pla@@ gu@@ ed on these lines a static object can be more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the Horiz@@ ontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the color button you can set the color of the guide lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it easily happens that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the digi@@ cam ; image processing and the tool to repair free rotation . select to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can reset the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair this is to use the function transform cutting out of image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automatic Cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the picture a bit after the rotation . however , note the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is lubri@@ cated a little . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the image with transforming tri@@ mming from image processing .
the tool is used to move part of the picture in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . this is not a rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane .
to your help you will see a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have finished the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image becomes blur@@ red . for a single lubrication , this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two alloys produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has un@@ si@@ ghtly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming tri@@ mming from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system at this point . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF underneath .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; only shows files in formats that you know . this happens by means of the file extension and a comparison of it with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file will be edited . you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can change this list of file extensions . in the Con@@ figuration section you will find more information about this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to even select the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read very helpful gu@@ id@@ ances in English under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Con@@ figuration section you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . hereby , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of Dave Coff@@ in &apos;s web page .
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in avi or m@@ peg format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies . when you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam , use the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies to start playing .

many tools you need the photo editing have been edited in &amp; digi@@ kam . your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft@@ mark , noise suppression , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture applying ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter to the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper area shows the original and the lower for comparison the effect of the filter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouse over &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place on the part of the image you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings of the last use of the module are scheduled .
the side@@ bar features the essential information on the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo Features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can zoom in or zoom out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates will be filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ not edit ; is an editor for P@@ allets files . the application can be used for manipul@@ ating color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the P@@ allets files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de , can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are located in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the Palette Editor , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders to files .
the cursor is displayed in the palette view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box is activated by clicking the Color button , the color is inserted from the color table by the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode was selected over@@ writing . this mode allows you to set this mode by selecting the check box under Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and In@@ sert .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line end character , if another color follows .
the colors in the palette and the output of color sel@@ ections can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ .@@ die &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs .
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ .@@ die &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Po@@ sters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ ene in &amp; posters ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and is in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ ene in &amp; posters ; to open or to open the graph@@ ene in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; in a &amp; posters ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 k@@ not and one h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graphs . required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . in the beginning , if you start &amp; k@@ graph viewer , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only contains the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum com@@ min@@ ution of a graph .
when the file has been modified by another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; may also remember your decision , so that later will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ graph viewer ; set up ... use , see also .
when you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; instance open , eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you will have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; instance , or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but you can also change it with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can open all the graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as change it later .
you can also specify how the graph is to be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled in by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without header and with another font
the refresh shop page gives you the option of setting the behavior when a file has been changed on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or the program can ask for each time .
the opening page gives the ability of &amp; k@@ graph viewer to specify when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is asked .
the session management page gives you the ability to set the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( opening or not opening the files of the last session or not ) or determine to be prompted for each start .
the context menu , usually with one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n , opens up additional possibilities :
here you can choose among various &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries found on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graph . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of directed graphs . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it produces depic@@ tions according to the spring@@ board model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring @-@ spring model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it uses the Fru@@ cht@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des in a circular manner according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ c@@ lic structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which will then be executed by a shell . the command should be able to accept the graph file as parameters , and give the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Algorith@@ ms specify special options , or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ ene ( judged or executed ) and applies the default algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if this is necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . with this poin@@ ter , click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get further help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it requires the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you will find more options in the Settings menu .
the main window of the icon editor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ Colour palette and the grid , in which you draw the icon .
creates a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . then a dialog appears in which you can choose whether the icon should be created from a template , or if you want to start anew from scratch .
restore the last undo step . if you do not have a step backward , this function is disabled .
inserts the clip@@ board contents as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
set the current symbol in gra@@ y@@ scale . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol palette of gray scales .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images are available to read new pictures and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to do this you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the Menu Add Images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by using the default duc@@ r@@ he default values to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the scanning button to see the image . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual , you will find more information .
make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed .
after pressing the button , you need to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the options of the target image appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder and # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected Im@@ por@@ tioned &gt; screen shot in the menu . a window appears where you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select The complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot is to wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate .
after the screen@@ shot was made , the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above .
the K@@ IP@@ I module calendar currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. warning : participants of this list speak English .
this module archives your albums on CD / DVD media with the K@@ 3@@ b burning program . you can easily select the files to be archi@@ ved . an HTML interface can be created for convenient navigation .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to show photos to people that are important to you . you can display your favorite photos of the world , place the photos of your camera online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family around the world .
the module Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be led by the process of generating a token . this will be used for your authentication so it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started to enable you to log in at Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Website . the following page will be presented after a successful application .
just close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module export to Fli@@ ck@@ r is started two times , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which shows the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . currently , the module does not support other authori@@ z@@ ations . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button Add images should be pressed once after you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . clicking the O@@ k button will start up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server .
the keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the picture as keywords during loading .
with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can set the per@@ missions on your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you change the option to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value recorded at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. warning : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic location allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above dialog appears then . to load a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with a GP@@ X file .
when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera zone here .
the setting for the maximum time deviation indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is below , the data will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a place for pictures you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the inter@@ pol@@ ation options and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set using the displayed map . select the region and zoom si@@ e.@@ Add this repeatedly until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be manually selected . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a gallery of HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four tab in which the settings can be adjusted . you only need to select these albums . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below will see the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each picture a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ,
the Reiter Album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write per@@ missions . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Import , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images is also stored in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth , which , of course , also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the preview pictures allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the programs to determine if errors occurred during production . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , an image is displayed by default in full@@ screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , as no compression of color information takes place . this can be found e.g. in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image . the data will be copied after you pressed the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please refer to exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the module MPEG enco@@ der can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can insert a basic image transfer . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD formats for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . after that , you can start using Extras MPEG En@@ asch@@ au to start the module .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should let them black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the m@@ peg @-@ output file .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all the settings to your wishes , you can start using the code encoding the generation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or calm@@ ly enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back .
if an indicator appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck Pack@@ ages using the Settings button at the bottom .
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images saved in RA@@ W format to one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you &apos;re satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to process your images frequently or later on , you should not choose the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el Canc@@ el .
batch conversion mode allows you to convert various images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck Package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge . to do this , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen size .
non @-@ proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre @-@ press : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be seen before .
after you started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images selected by you . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images to add them to the list of images to be sent .
with the Images button , the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . here you just have to add the addresses and the subject .
don &apos;t mind sending too many images at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of emails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments on the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached .
the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you to JPEG format .
if you select JPEG image file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au module , a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option shows that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a final loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly select to show that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . the best distance , however , depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , each transition between the pictures sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show .
at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. warning : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse through this , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , entries are now available in each group , i.e. persons , places and group keywords .
in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have added your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the browser view changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images shown on which both people can be seen . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images on a few individual images .
if you have selected all the persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of action .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can store your own thumb@@ nail , which is of course also valid for locations , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
to view images by name , select the button that is located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do so , you will need to open a category editor , as shown in the picture . here you can adjust the image for the respective person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and by selecting which part of the image should be displayed or trun@@ cated .
when you enter the search entry in the main window , a dialog is displayed that is very similar to the dialog for displaying the image properties . you can view this dialog on the image again .
if you enter a string in the cap@@ tion or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you like , you can also enter a date to be searched for ; the date can be either a part of the total file , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can browse all pictures according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try out the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introductory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , in case you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this line shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of that date will be displayed in preview ) and the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time information . if you select an area , you will only see images of this period in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can call through the menu file HTML ...
before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the review and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , select whether you want to create a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file to be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information you want to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed , which is obviously obvious to the viewer . for example , that all images are of a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not addressed specifically .
at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . as a result , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 does not download any images , such as a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you set . so he can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transfer time . if he wants to get an image larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , set the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
it is best to select a base folder for all of your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you have to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder is stored and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after creating your images , you can check if these are really all visible for viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will start . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that are just described have all three based on basic folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have already spent a lot of time to record the pictures , people on pictures , recording location , etc . , you have to do this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can share all the images and share this file so independently . however , the obvious draw@@ back is the file size .
you can either import a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files will only be possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can call through the Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available :
at the option Manual in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export file option .
the last option on this page is Maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the Import menu File ... select , become &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the im@@ porting assistant consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category Person@@ s of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the im@@ porting file are to be imported and what categories they are in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database .
it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you are looking for example pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will find the different steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting information about your images , through ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder in which your images are stored and will use it automatically on future starts . if you want to read another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; use the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
over the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings options are explained .
to the left you see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can invoke by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up full member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in the dialog .
in the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface .
the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call via the modules themselves .
since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them to your own pictures . demo database can be called either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you !
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not working . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications arrange their images in albums : this is an album just a folder . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for albums for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
the current album , which is simply the current view , is simulated , so all the images that show you the preview at the moment .
in addition to the current album , you have to create a list of albums , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you , for example , use the category Person@@ s , you will get &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules are compatible with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do this , start the Settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture , you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start and photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you can see the window that you have entered your image database . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the picture to show you an overview with all the available images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the people shown on the picture , etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example , on all images Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen were recorded .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text field by setting people , places , and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to reloc@@ ate the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people are shown , you can , by the fact that the names used are shifted upward , to find and assign the persons faster .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting after date under the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture to the right .
if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , then it may be more convenient to select all these images and use the menu item several entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
in the picture , you will see a browser window displaying the USA as an overview . to show you that it is an over@@ size group , a special icon will appear .
in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it there in order to make it an sub @-@ category of this entry .
you can move and move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the boxes that form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window out of a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the pane area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are happy with the settings , click the Options button ... which offers you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide windows . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the image in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all pictures in case you have no filter . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will appear in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the preview . just select the images you want to delete and either select the Del@@ ete key or select Edit menu in the Edit menu . now , you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use images without having you saved on your hard drive . of course you have to store the images somewhere , so that you can record it in the database index . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the necessary images can be downloaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is trun@@ cated are not stored on the hard drive . however , this can be seen in the images 1 @-@ 9 . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for the images 5 @-@ 9 , so you can preview these images . however , you can &apos;t view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from folders and copy them back into it . so far , it doesn &apos;t support you to ask for inser@@ ting the respective CD . so if you want to avoid the mess of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images .
in the pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those you want to make for others and click on current view lock in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also use all the pictures that your little sister can see , and choose the menu entry Any@@ thing except current view .
this allows you to specify which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry to lock images , causing all the images you have locked . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click on Lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy Settings menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other hand , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them at some point . for this reason , it has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in the picture . it shows , of course , the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether any information is to be displayed . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see the matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and back by using the button image up and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus . start and stop the slide show by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch it to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can drag and zoom into the image . to zoom in , you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . the plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the Sync button , the zoom sets the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that they are in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the rotating functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can comment on the current image using the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can view the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and see them as good or bad as you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features while viewing them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can make a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in this you see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set characteristics on your images , you can see them in the browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , then you can simply use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you want to show categories in dre preview , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will allow you to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can undo your painted later .
in order to view the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wi@@ re@@ model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu In@@ sert .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will pop up to enable you to choose the correct position :
you can delete selected objects from the scene , either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse context menu .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to App@@ ly these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will appear with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click on App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render only a part of the texture ( e.g. texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross local .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the parent object or as an absolute value . objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their Visi@@ bility Level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility stage chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement , or if you need another arrangement , you can set them arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below an existing view , drag the anchor to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the link to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the whole height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the anchor in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flash@@ cards at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the anchor on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the main window .
to close a view click on the small cross in the cham@@ ber@@ ing bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you can find entries for any type of view . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location .
you can save the current window view with View Windows order ... save it . it will display a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program needs to be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item view scene render .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many rendering modes , from a quick preview to full@@ screen shots of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar , or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to have a name that lets you know the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the sub@@ section sub@@ section and enter the image section to render into the input fields .
in combination field quality you can select properties , which &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection light . a detailed description of the rendering properties can be found in the User Manual of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just one beam each pixel , different errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and details are sometimes not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the display . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . generally , pictures with this feature look better .
if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and bin@@ ds &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive , because the super @-@ sampling comes with the adjacent pixel . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is split up again and again , because the rec@@ ur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray uses a beam of pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are pursued separately and checked for further divisions . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this map you can set whether the alpha @-@ channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have not hit an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the Import menu item ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this source text between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can draw objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object in the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; render a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User documentation for the displayed object . set the path to your retention and version here . versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 are supported .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type label .
you can set the object start of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid seper@@ ately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values give a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects like the ball , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
if you cross high level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this feature creates a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering .
if you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern made of two adjustable colours .
if you cross the floor , a bottom is rendered under the objects . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern made of two adjustable colours .
if you tick the edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value .
on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the Window Pan@@ e section , explains how to create and save window orders .
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the existing window classi@@ fications list shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
every window ordering is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
the position of the new window . with New column , you create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with flash@@ cards you will receive a map view together with the previous view and floating anch@@ oring the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere at one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you will get a black image .
if you don &apos;t want to insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black image .
if you have installed everything correctly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ ore ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will have to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item , so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera is in the view control points that you can change the camera &apos;s target point . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
if you apply the App@@ ly button or enter the input button , the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you will see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example insert a Qu@@ ader ( insert End@@ al Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or enter the enter button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also displays the level , albeit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane will expand to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree carefully , you will find that you can fold the item for the bottom by clicking on the + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find only the standard options for each new object : scale , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to practice a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens , in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor pigment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view , how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pig@@ ments preview only shows a matt black material , because you have to enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and the bul@@ let in the preview , just click the App@@ ly button and then enter the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
choose the color in the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step you should be able to perform simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eller ; already understood . the ball can be created just as easily as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the button ) , so the ball would float above the ground as you moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering is now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface looks like a matt black material . in the next step , set a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the bottom , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select First sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on sphere Pig@@ ment , then select one @-@ color and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press the input button .
the settings shine effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers . hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a rendering method to produce a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that render the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effects . so the scene pixels are processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default File dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest item in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you haven &apos;t got saved changes in the scene .
repeat the recently rever@@ ted command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing undo .
store the current window order and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er using this option .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can use this option to add and remove tool@@ bars for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to make rough surfaces , without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis , using an image file as color card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
using &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking on the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all pictures should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , just type the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right bottom corner . if an appropriate file name was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and edit and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the key short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set down below . default is not full@@ screen mode .
this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still watch the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background will also be filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can display the program as well .
with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . pres@@ etting is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 .
here you can change the short@@ cut short@@ cut for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduced the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlarge The picture increases by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and make correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to at least problems and potential improvements .
this shows a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all information you need is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then we would like to encourage you to ask other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , you can ask here questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to get involved is to join the developer mailing list . guide to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo . to access these settings , you need to set up the settings show@@ photo ; settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left .
in the exposure indicator , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ coat or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you should display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ shot ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side bar in image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes a scan scan and save images .
&amp; chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes a scan scan and save images . &amp; chann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving each image or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; with the command chann@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no default scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; chann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not address these options .
in order to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan for the scan area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . he can also set the zoom so that the complete preview fits into the window .
when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you preview the preview in the settings before saving , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and par@@ sley will lead to a demo@@ lition and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the type such as &amp; chann@@ l@@ ite ; save images . open dialog for each image opens the dialog before each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; chann@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically be saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved when saving without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as the default for dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically fed images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is recorded each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for storing . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button On Beg@@ ins the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; chann@@ l@@ ite ; .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global key short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select Global Hot keys . click the right mouse button in the player window and specify short commands ... Select .
you can set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , most of which can also be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section is comprised of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break could be &amp; z@@ b ; this will look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use a dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run .
Beg@@ in require &apos;@@ Kor@@ und@@ um &apos;s Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and manage Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; each K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , scripts are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use .
configure Feed the script to display the setup dialog . to store and store the setup data , each script must take care of it . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok will set the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is being played . the script could now ask for more information on the new piece with D@@ CO@@ P functions ( e.g. metadata or unit length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry has been cli@@ cked . to remove a user @-@ defined entry , it is possible to use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termination , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to complete , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal tar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 ) so that the user can clearly see the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the gener@@ alization of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining load@@ able modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can add it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you just search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collections browser and quick search , you will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision still falls , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake is used , you shouldn &apos;t have any trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the configure script using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be satisfied so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without any effort on the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in addition , if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed ( Ju@@ C ) .
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
atmospheric design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
dropping files in the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers use : you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above .
save play@@ lists when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date piece of play visible , that the playlist window will pop up / un@@ roll in order to keep the running piece in the visible window area .
when changing the context browser , the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fonts section , you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . by selecting O@@ wn fonts , the otherwise gray section will be enabled . you can select fonts for the following pane : playlist windows , player windows and context browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of custom colour scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color selection selected among them for foreground and background color .
playback on the start causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback automatically continues with the piece at the point where it has been stopped at the last stop .
the On @-@ Screen Display window will allow you to switch on the O@@ SD . if you are using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors gives you the opportunity to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color surfaces will open the dialog for color selection . if you don &apos;t use colors selected , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors will be used .
the Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below is a list of available space holders and what they mean .
the screen option is designed for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers still activate further settings in this map .
the card card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to browse for music files . to include a folder in the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes to set the folder to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders are searched for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collections database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is necessary in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : if the host is located on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
username : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the flash@@ .@@ f@@ m card is the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting enables you &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
to retrieve similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters can be accessed from the played piece . note : you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok just needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to make k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will make trouble . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by following ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and make the collection again .
usually this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then turn off automatically when in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or at least use no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by email ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens when a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error when writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om@@ Mode / Rep@@ lication / Dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the icon effects are easily forgotten . note that in some cases up to three times you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ k@@ app : icon look@@ up error : binary : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ko@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are solved most easily by means of an expert , your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please bear in mind if there is something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only appears a blank playlist . how do music pieces come into there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the Start sub@@ window was converted into the stati@@ stic window . you will find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click the title bar of the playlist and select column view . click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press the file on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select Von playlist removed from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop it down , just like you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the playlist of the playlist , right next to the addition button , you can save the Play@@ list button . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . see also lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you will also find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be Which Media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it can ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 de@@ cks are provided ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input button
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
when you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device needs to provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software bl@@ ender ) .
the output of this command should help you find the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another sink ( e.g. os@@ sink ) .
you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you only want to listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . enable sound servers to run with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed play . read this error report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; AB . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . follow the command register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the I@@ RC Channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then perform all ff@@ m@@ peg files once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder .
please report below bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. If you have a complete list of suggestions / requests , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of features deter you , they &apos;re all easy to use .
the playlist window can be split into two main areas , on the left hand side of the navigation pane . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser shows various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows will later be replaced in detail .
if you already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may notice that the sub @-@ window has dropped off . the information presented there are now distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the performer and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window shows information about the piece . in the title there is the name of the piece , interpreter and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to hit the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the context browser will also show cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next area , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended items . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .

you can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the text sub@@ window , the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages with the help of self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the internet . if there is no text script running , you can choose which to be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ing only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - first the pieces are arranged according to the performer and below it will be a further division after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Differ@@ ent performers .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted to Interpre@@ t and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabe@@ tically and are ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them according to performer .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing according to your needs .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection as soon as you change something to the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this might take a while .
directly below the tool@@ bar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes for using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a drop @-@ down sel@@ ector which allows you to filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , ranging from the last 24 hours up to one year . in addition , you can also select your total collection , which makes the filter practically disabled .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options .
load - This is the current playlist , adding the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
app@@ end to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you will achieve the same effect .
setting pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will play you next .
as a playlist ... Save the selected pieces as play@@ lists . you are asked for a name under which the list should be stored .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transferring to the media player . see the Media Player browser section for more details .
burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - This means that the selected pieces are burned to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the selected album as a compilation - marking the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among various performers .
picking up a selection tag - Chan@@ ges the album selected as a compilation back into a normal album . after that the album will no longer be displayed under various interpre@@ ters but again under the accompanying performer .
play@@ lists are easy to use with many play@@ lists , including Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists .
the bottom part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created intelligent play@@ lists are possible . click the Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist . there , you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub @-@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . when finished , click App@@ ly . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . when the transfer is finished , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive binding for your iPod .
among the tool@@ bars there is a search field that allows you to search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . if you type : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press enter key , you can access music in the file musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
when the playlist is longer than in the window , the app@@ ending of files can be difficult by simply dropping . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically include dropped files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired location . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed , which contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you type separated search terms by whit@@ esp@@ ace , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then wrap the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ somewhat searches for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this searches for all the pieces that either include Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bad .
you can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order to the entries . the entries will then be labeled with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button to add to the playlist . to the right , you can save play@@ lists , empty play@@ lists , and Rand@@ om M@@ ats .
next , the buttons will follow the undo and restore , so you can rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted by clicking the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you see in the player window over the right mouse button . above this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many other buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set up the buttons displayed by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about play@@ lists . it displays the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for chance mode and retri@@ eval is displayed by clicking double in the respective display area with the mouse .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the Status Bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . on this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization Plugins section . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover administration . select from :
the queue administration received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the play in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . then you can change the order of the pieces in the queue administration .

after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog that looks like this or something like this :
in this dialog window , you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the original image is completed , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to burn the data .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / K@@ DE@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b website can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org where you can get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . you can also get feedback , access community help from the forums and learn new news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least 1 k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text @-@ like description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burn all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also offers &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , it reaches &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; but a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet such programs are commonly referred to as Ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional audio encoding technology and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition with MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and En@@ co@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well @-@ developed MP3 Decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 En@@ co@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t w@@ ma files to convert them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you will need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ G@@ GER : a feature full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage , e.g. for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ fortunate effect that the music pieces are played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and automatically re@@ play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to rel@@ o@@ ad recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise a new fil@@ en@@ ame will be asked .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save As will appear where you can select folders and file names for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and modi@@ fying the project . you can also cancel the project and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what is to happen with it , as if you would have called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each non @-@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it , as if you called file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you are extrac@@ ting the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; causes burning of the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described via the What is it ? help described ( at@@ tain@@ able via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you have files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session are always included , even if this feature is not used . it is more than helpful for you to see the files and folders already present on the media .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project .
this allows copying of a CD to another medium , even without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create an image of a CD , which you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows the copy of a DVD to another medium , even without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create an image of a DVD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW disk . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW disk .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing mod@@ i over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
the dialog will prompt you for an * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not currently supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will prompt you for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and trim of black edges .
this information is displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of the window and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and blocks of the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided that a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head@@ line is a nar@@ rower area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box for modi@@ fying the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard assignment to the bottom .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be performed . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work straight away . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and for fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with one &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality may be controlled by a shell script for example .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so it is more your taste and the type of your task in addition to which the included programs will give you preference .
in this chapter we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in common , support &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD , and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ C@@ d ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void Bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project get by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String parent ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folders :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT apps Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ mp / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be saved audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible , depending on enco@@ der that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on disk ) and of many enco@@ ders enco@@ des these wa@@ v files ( these enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders may be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) comp@@ ress into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders have to be installed . however , all of these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , but only the enco@@ der packages must be installed which are needed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher codes gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and comp@@ ressing factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; it is not possible to b@@ ypass any copy protection . in any case , &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup has to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; retrieve information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or work completely without a network , where everything is manually recorded .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page , step by step , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
start the C@@ DD@@ B request of the CD @-@ data according to the installation of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be made . )
start reading and - if an enco@@ der was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup guide - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of enco@@ ders available so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . note that previously the enco@@ der was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already used file will be selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as En@@ co@@ der , for setting up the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right enco@@ der .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are others such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and barely available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by compressed data compression according to their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important because both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still provided with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues
+ high to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG ab@@ outs is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a song . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good pleasure for music by young people , portable devices and auto stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you want to have absolutely the highest quality regardless of the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information obtained manually or automatically fet@@ ched through the program from fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator need to be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button designation in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of entering into the computer . it is important to note that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of translation : this means the author ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from being done by the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be added harm .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b may not be used with another ( fake ) address than the specified in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears that the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has verified the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; when using fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is needed . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from CD and WAV files on my computer ?
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; those who want to know more precisely , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the right distribution must be installed first if this has not yet happened .
for saving the read WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver .
after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , writing and reading real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ der of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ og@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this won &apos;t work !
there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give you tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine , as it is considered as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you have write per@@ missions on it ( eg by trying to copy something into it ) .
the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something probably just done once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what every read &amp; CD needs to be repeated .
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and what structure is used . since we are lazy , we share the program to download the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it at any time of reading a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program , so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , then a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card card General settings . here , there is not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is as left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information please select , so that you will be informed if information is missing to create keywords ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector is simpler , a &amp; CD will be found . this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or file name is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ aming and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections need to be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map .
C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
C@@ DD@@ B @-@ Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , since however many fire@@ walls log the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to send any &amp; CD ; send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously dischar@@ ging pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so just try yourself .
CD ; disc@@ ard reading the last piece : check this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / or the path / folder can be specified in which the WAV files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
just enter it as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; entry for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneous enco@@ ding WAV files : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be attempted to en@@ code more than one wa@@ v file at the same time .
this is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each read of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music clever@@ ly , you never need to change them again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard drive . we will create and set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , was described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is structured , because we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each read @-@ out &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet available in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data fet@@ ched for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually input data instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
do not try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a brief moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , look for the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section on basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; a window is displayed , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you haven &apos;t selected the check box for the automatic request of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the sample on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the &apos; Current title &apos; field , unless you have a collection with different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ally per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album , and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this option is set on the encoding settings tab ; take a look at the section &apos; Basic Settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the release CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; you get back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you typ@@ ed all tit@@ le@@ data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear when you download the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles which are marked so are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece into or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
if the selection process has been selected by clicking on the Sel@@ ection button , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and follow what is running .
click on the Ri@@ der Or@@ ders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see you when you try to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error oc@@ cured immediately after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in case of low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear .
now the last title is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message will be displayed for a short time in the upper left of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . install the package k@@ de@@ multimedia from your distribution . if you read this , you have probably already done it already ...
this section is aimed at persons compiled from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many different options . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e how to proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially when there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it . and if you read this , he has left that section and therefore agrees with this proposal .
strange if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke game from &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , it also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , which do not have other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ cer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the procedure used .
when you finish playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you pull it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( for several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after another . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and using the controller .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo ad and thus change the speed of playing . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar , like a pressure on the button pause , or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu piece , interrup@@ ts the playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be saved in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use lyrics , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used , so that you don &apos;t have to manually set the entry automatic text selection , but you still have the possibility to change it if you want to see the other way .
in case you want to specify an event type , select the entries text events or property events from the Settings menu . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you combine . these are played in series . in this section stands how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . these can be found in the collection menu at the point Organ@@ ize . click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then giving the name for the new collection . this collection will be included in the beginning of the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the threads in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song to the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection then will be added to the still opened items .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button previous piece , the previous piece from the menu item or press the key arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map which converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type and thus always lets trumpet sound when originally a piano should play .
if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all the required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so I can in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section shows how the patches of General MIDI are displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can hear a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot . to do this , please use the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch , where every note is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ary instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key maps for each channel and instrument . you just need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map the perc@@ ussions on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . take a look at the provided key maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to change the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on Channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which relationship pitch Ben@@ der events are multiplied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file there are no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as ) .
this setting is needed because GM gives us a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these keyboard you see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the View Channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find e.g. a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t comp@@ el anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid , compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s homepage )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files separately .
OK , support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
before , activate automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to recover the standard tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or go ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) , only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window change and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you just want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn the automatic Add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to continue to program .

if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make a lot of joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send me a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may have the file already .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; written completely in my spare time and won &apos;t get any money from anyone . I would like to stress that I am only programming further because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid , with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on , as well as for playback of DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; has not yet been completed than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is only displayed when information is displayed .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played out after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you click on an entry , your group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback will start with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can change that only when you click on a name of a category , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category , then select it from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , select the Play@@ list from the Edit menu and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the edit mode is left or another group is selected without having to balance the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some features can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying in the end animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of start animation can be the display of a favorite shot : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; quot ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; quot ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; quot ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; quot ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; quot ; / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ;
there is one tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; console &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player . everything must be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even paste the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to play the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player must be used as service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
to always take a given back@@ end for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual modification of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , the device and TV channels need to be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog box is to be used under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ y- &gt; VD@@ R@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected , of which one is selected . the code to be used must be found out ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of S@@ MB can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . therefore , the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension needs to be supported only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must include the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support , and is required to compile &amp; play .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be rever@@ ted to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the &amp; Linux / Linux distribution . the installation should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further compilation and are included on the box ; website .
this manual is for everyone - independent of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the box should be made .
if you have any questions about the compilation of &amp; Ki@@ le , or if you wish to add extensions , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; posters ; and to learn about its possibilities the manual to Kate should be put on . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the Editor of &amp; Po@@ sters ; Start .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a lay@@ man ( over@@ lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here is only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . um &amp; lat@@ ex ; good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just as other mark@@ up languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text gr@@ e are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again using the \ \ end { document } command .
the quick entry assistant of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; . the selection of the wizard ( Menu ) offers some possibilities for creating the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
document classes : this explains the type of document to be created : article &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ ari@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; book &#93; , films &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this will set the character encoding . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems use U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they have to be selected only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( compl@@ ying with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it is a short description of the functions and more detailed information are given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source code editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . if you see gray areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it will hear it through the modest appearance of the output file nonetheless . however , it will save you through the high@@ lighting time and hass@@ le .
with automatic adjustment of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically an empty line ( for input of the text ) and the associated line for closing the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the Settings menu ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be viewed and viewed by a single click .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; as soon as a DVI file is created , boun@@ cing &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the actual output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and to print DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the R@@ Ã ¼ ck search , the elements of the DVI file are connected to the editor and once on an element in the DVI . file was cli@@ cked , the corresponding section is jumped in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked to the corresponding place in DVI .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick @-@ build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is plu@@ gged into the plu@@ gged , plu@@ gged , and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the fast construction .
when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be conspic@@ uous . the selection fields were developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document . the first drop @-@ down field is for the rapid integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ sible &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the Ad@@ ditional panel Fur@@ ther is for inclusion of items such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available options are :
name : with this command , a term for a section , an image or other element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection above a selection box possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literary inclu@@ sions . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written naturally also in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¼ e is used for determining the font base . it can be used to define the font properties for the main text , the base notes , etc . the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document may be written by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses according to the \ \ document@@ class command contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also happen later in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ dele@@ tion or but@@ ton@@ er quick build .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; for storing it automatically .
if the document is comp@@ iling , it should be searched for errors when logging in . if using quick @-@ build , &amp; Ok@@ ular should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the text editor 12 is created and only a few areas should have a different font . the command \ \ begins { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then allow the creation of the font files within the surrounding environment .
the changes are only supervised within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities for assign@@ ing the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold print , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics print and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be displayed recur@@ sively with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language has been shown , then follows a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments would be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . to do this , min@@ d. a quote , a few places in bold and ital@@ ics print and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI file is created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it out and have fun .
DVI is an independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are needed ( see ) . at the seventh step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI file to other formats . once the DVI file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin in other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this just set Modern under Settings Ki@@ le ... Tools Buil@@ d to be selected .
in order to drill the forward search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked onto the default search . the jump to the corresponding place in DVI ; the viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; oc@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jumped to the corresponding line . for this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; defined as text editor ( Setup ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if using quick @-@ assembly of the &amp; DVI file ; the viewer cannot open , an error can be present . if there is an error , this will be summ@@ arized in the log file or in the message window .
the log file lists the source of errors in the source code . in the editor you can use the button Pre@@ vious La@@ Te@@ X Error and N@@ Ã ¤ st@@ r La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumps between errors . to view the er@@ ron@@ eous line , you have to click on the error in the log and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the er@@ ron@@ eous line .
once cli@@ cked on the respective button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written or used by the wizard for the rapid creation of a new document . for more information , see the section .
most users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting File template from document ...
when creating a new document from a file New , some strings may be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings box ... settings can be set in General Settings .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way , the following steps have to be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of default .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files . if a simple way to create a template is deleted , it should be searched for one on the Internet and can be found in the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Plac@@ ards ; as an internal editor . &amp; Plac@@ ards ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about it and its possibilities , the manual to Kate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter work with the Editor of &amp; Po@@ sters ; begin .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called via La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands , which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
double click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; word . this means that when you click on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when dra@@ gging the text with left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse different kinds of source code and to highlight it . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assistants may include additional jumping marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks inside the text . the Men@@ Ã ¤ ge Edit jumping brands or the appropriate key @-@ keys enable the jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted by this jump stamp , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a sign .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already outstanding offers have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; contains always many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code .
select the word under the current cursor position . this option also has an extended meaning as this command is also called &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a R@@ Ã ¼ r @-@ s@@ lash ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) end in the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Plac@@ ards ; provides the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit selecting paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command is used to jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to check the surroundings .
if the cursor is before or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command completes the recently opened environment so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are specified by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that match those from the Edit environment .
this command is used to jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the welded bracket .
this command is used to jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the buck@@ le closing bracket .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the sh@@ ov@@ el of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many ne@@ sted groups braces can quickly be lost . this command completes the last opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple suits are used as a device . for the useful implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple instructions . &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and adds two closing notes for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic import of the double quotes can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
it can also be used in specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and there@@ with German or French suits . there are also many more languages available .
when shifting the shift key , enter a smart new@@ line . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break but at the same time the \ \ item command .
within a table environment close &amp; box ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close line breaks off .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby arrange all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . when using Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the underlying line . even though this tab@@ ul@@ ator may not be the necessary , add &amp; drop ; some spaces for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator .
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already providing a good source of source code , it has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; for specific commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings Ki@@ le ... fully @-@ adjusted .
when starting a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } command &amp; box ; automatically add the \ \ end { environment } command to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the button , the last character of the input is removed and it is possible to gr@@ ind the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be res@@ ized by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command . alternatively , jump marks can be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by editing jumping brand N@@ Ã ¤ t@@ lest jumping brand and then the desired parameters can then be frozen .
set up Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; you can make adjustments to these lists . there can be different wish lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as books of the general language used can be selected .
command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . it must always have a few letters with \ \ begin to result . on the other hand , environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of environments .
when invo@@ king the default mode above the menu editing environment or the key Alt + Shift key Space , the command is automatically merged to open the environment and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and ended by pressing the key .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; detects that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is merged .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; you can make adjustments to these lists . this mode uses the list of default modes for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of abri@@ d@@ ets that can be replaced immediately by changing strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... boxes can be set up . for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is inserted over the menu editing or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space bar , the character L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
great W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been noted that many buyers are written more than once in a document . this provides &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all the already written wat@@ chers .
this mode can be set up in the Settings dialog box ... Ki@@ le can be switched off . here you can also set the threshold for the display of the completion .
the complete files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the local home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abri@@ d@@ ging ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the dialog rendered graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics to the graphics formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to be able to examine the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are summ@@ arized in groups in the Cre@@ ating , Cre@@ ating , and Gener@@ ating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further transformation can be used the key @-@ key Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI file can be viewed in the standard viewer using Alt ; 3 , by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and by means of old ; 5 the PS file is viewed .
when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will pop up each time .
a new project is being funded by the Men@@ Ã ¼ project Neues Projekt .... This provides the following information for the project :
when filling the file name window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed over scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be modified in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a rather sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; text live ; are delivered with many documents , including documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) , but rather a comprehensive operating instruction for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents &amp; boxes ; documents delivered and here a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space button open the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor , which can be found on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; work@@ space environment . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also a part of the Fink project , allowing &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures edit you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; . with the command line interface , you generate random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily signatures the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . for each day use there@@ with different signatures , as with the random signatures create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . by doing this , you will receive an lt ; empty signature ; and add your new signature in the bottom section . signature example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save them with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file Save or click the Save Disk symbol .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the tool@@ bar .
open the dialog for short commands . here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the button on the right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .
for the use of &amp; k@@ sig ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .
all call stack elements are listed here . the older the stack entry is , the lower is its frame number . see the example below .

version 3.2 of &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all these tools use Com@@ bin@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . if we lift it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ x is located in the ge@@ an@@ gled work folder , then let the current working folder be cli@@ cked . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder you want in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted each time my pro@@ c is started .
as I said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for this .
if the recently opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ Book is , then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ Book is to be found .
if it comes to output on the screen , your file is defective . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then let the current file simply be cli@@ cked . if not , delete the file with the current file and select the file to be vali@@ dated by means of a different file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , click the well @-@ formed check selection .
to use a &amp; D@@ TD ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) and enter the place of the &amp; D@@ TD ; by definition UR@@ I ; file selection .
yes , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is already selected , then let the current file simply be selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file selection file .
enter the name of the file , as the result is named , and the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plugin system is very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality instantly and don &apos;t have to wait until someone builds the f@@ aked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we will begin using the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog enables you to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of one &apos;s own identity are important with regard to news and comments . see for further information on remarks .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something happens . see in for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be drawing the opening and closing of the project so that later can be seen how much someone is working on it or sending a message when a file is backed up as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties Di@@ alo@@ ges can create , edit and delete events .
an E@@ Mail is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub@@ project manager .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
to enter notes is simple . either the comment entry from the Editor context menu can be selected or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword will be entered in a comment section followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( R@@ ole ) , with the nick@@ name of the team member &apos;s nick@@ name , role plays a role in the project .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is D@@ TD agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible from the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be setup by setting Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated one after another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with respect to tags including car completion can be changed with this . the entries are :
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if approached , tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
automatically close not optional tags : as above for all other tags except the simple tags .
start and end @-@ tag automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic creation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . the default settings can be restored using the Standard button .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be passed ) . however , this setting here is ej@@ ected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting here is ej@@ ected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates periodi@@ c backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program , the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in your own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard show ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
set the default window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the U@@ I by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ ype command line parameter .
the warning messages section is used to control the display of warnings by hook of non @-@ en@@ quiries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set to display symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL and the source text view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in detail .
in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action solved by clicking on the Stru@@ c@@ tured Tree by clicking on the Stru@@ c@@ tured Tree .
in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be automatically opened . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
the area to set the abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that is un@@ folding during editing . abbrevi@@ ations are in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ clause means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here , the plu@@ gins can be managed . plu@@ gins are part @-@ applications of third party , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ capable application , best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located on a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode load : check if the plugin refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . select whether the entered information is correct , even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently , only one plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in dialog box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ U@@ I :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left Do@@ ck .
a view in which all items are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action is used to connect to de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in the normal case you do not have to pay attention .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session Star@@ ts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues .
the de@@ bu@@ gger carries out the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger carries out the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include it is corrected .
assign the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and go to the next as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you can help you get better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . they allow &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . they allow &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the Tag folder and the tool@@ bars . Tag folders are handy , symbolic past@@ es of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions faster in a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the owner dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self . tool@@ bars allow quick inser@@ ting of tags into a document without a risk of a write error .
tag Fol@@ ders are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better view and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but the only element type above itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( family 2 only )
only valid for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 only )
set a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only happen once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains additional tags that describe how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is an only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to reach the source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a method name and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tag .
a container tag group@@ ing the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an only element type element .
defines the position of the attribute text within a dialog . this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is an only element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is an only element type .
all tag@@ XML files need to start with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; note . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; replaced .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog is up in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . dialog will appear , its simple instructions will follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , the check is only done when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ de .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via D@@ TD editing D@@ TD settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = turn@@ around 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name will be used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set up with Settings ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the button short@@ cut assigned to this action . clicking the user defined button can be assigned a key short@@ cut ; with K@@ einer the current key short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , can be started . examples from &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various Lo in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text will be att@@ aches unique to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods described above , a script can input from &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the default input . in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the standard input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be rer@@ ou@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages are directed to the default output . it can be specified what is to be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the input field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in any given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the brand .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the matching tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; if available so that entering the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ugly icon . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other Program@@ s ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size .
please note that the symbol created does not only help you to remember what action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
in view of the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually seen as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol will be start@@ led ; -@@ tag will be inserted in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with Settings actions specify ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be spl@@ itted into several groups for a better overview .
I would like to select the separ@@ ator ( top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the Tren@@ ner supports group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
after new XML does not exist , it will be created im@@ planted , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the proper folder . please adjust their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) is loaded ( will ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most not@@ e@@ worthy extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory , if someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = func@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html ... language Reference = Basic syntax , ... basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # prior to Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and lo@@ gically at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; Note . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files are replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements separated by scre@@ ed ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily store your file do@@ cr@@ c according to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( like you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the waste resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else who will be sent . in different places there is an email send menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archives , from where all the others &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available when our team uses them as correct and useful for the publication . to make a lasting contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for their private g@@ pg key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the dialog New resource you have to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and start clicking OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the D@@ TD D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , inqu@@ ires &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears to indicate the source of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD loading and converting a D@@ TD . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description , which should be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tion@@ Script : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , brings &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and to get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter attempts to bring these concepts nearer to them , without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . it stores everything that is globally selected , in the common folder structure of &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool tracks , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a certain project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document set entries , such as closing the current , other or all boxes , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editing pane will lead to a further context menu with regard to the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse poin@@ ter , help to the word under the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file if the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus works ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus works , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; then click the icon representing the tag . now you can enter the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in different fields in a dialog .
the construction man@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable information to be navig@@ ated to &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . to navigate , open it and strip them . in the presentation with map managers available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation building views .
project Management is a powerful tool called &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be done using the contex@@ tual menu displayed .
almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , an entire website &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and Project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right click of an element opens a list of commands regarding navigation and ref@@ res@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the application @-@ based application system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentary for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus has ; two flash@@ cards at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this flash@@ card shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to D@@ TD are displayed .
this flash@@ card shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus works are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the Cho@@ colate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can backup and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files on your system . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have trouble starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of you bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why developers , what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . to extend as they need it for their needs .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ deleted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be increased dramatically .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more details about the documentation are with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either typing this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and served by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it , and the oldest record is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check in the section on Tem@@ plates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported .
converts the special characters to &amp; HTML when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; sp@@ elling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches on or off the block sel@@ ector . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script will issue error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
the problem re@@ porter is activated when the problem re@@ porter is switched on as soon as one changes to the structural tree .
displays the symbol column to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set Book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are saved using the .@@ web@@ pr@@ j file extension .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows e.g. to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , manage the project . in chapter and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details explained .
load a project tool@@ bar . these are kept in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or Project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . it just creates the name . actions need to be added by setting actions ... These tool@@ bars are saved by tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables the loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
download one &amp; D@@ TD ; you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refresh@@ ed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
this only works with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . smart insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus works ; inser@@ ting by means of tool@@ bars is denied if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ edi@@ cht@@ schem@@ ata depends on the posters ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line tag identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms for developing . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
instant switching between different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , the switching time may sometimes require time or incomplete graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode that corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting a entry will enable the appropriate sub@@ window .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , main window .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters ; you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add which ones can add and modify the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled up from top to bottom , because , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be set later using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus &quot; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have a static web content you want to download and change . in case of server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. , PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let go if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started anew , not han@@ ger .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to goo@@ dies .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , cl@@ inging out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard will contain three settings that simplify your work . in the menu with project project properties , these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window or with the Shift key ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .

the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this can be used to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed will support you . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button .
in the sub @-@ window profiles , high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing out its own tree view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration window , event actions can be switched on and these actions can be added , changed or deleted . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at the moment .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus works , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files find . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder beha@@ ves as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the context menu called with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows you to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgot at programming . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather un@@ secure password on the disk does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many upload profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving feature or a danger . use them after your measurement . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , that is , by simply sw@@ apping the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the project tool@@ bar project or project tool@@ bar , accessible by the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which you have the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows you to adapt &amp; source Saul to your own way of working .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best stack@@ able via the Tools menu bar . use and Add are different . adding tool bar is handled in the section Add to Tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and the symbols on this can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , and other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bars ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be indicated in the dialog , which actions on these or other tool@@ bars should be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files for linking . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; use templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you present for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents by means of links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be written by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specialized documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document should be included again and again in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment over a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure according to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book , etc ; . ) and choose File As template Save As Local template Save As ...
once this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check in the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be dra@@ gged with drag and drop on the tree @-@ view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : just copy the file into a template folder . it can use all file management functions for it , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files tree view , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can also be saved as a local or global template .
project templates provide a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ print head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically link with &amp; PHP ; create , insert or link files with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window template is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set in such a way , it would de@@ activate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project , allowing to copy content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to provide a whole presentation already with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing the right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which are accessible from the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second spl@@ its the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source code editor if necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; a small green icon displays the V@@ oh@@ and@@ absence of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit , it is still necessary to edit the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is active , this mode is already active , enabling the active cursor from one window to another , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via Settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing V@@ PL ; you can select between synchronization after one click or automatically . basically , the recommendation : a small span for fast computers and a large range for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the manual encoding .
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click into the list allows the change of the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of shaping the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is possible just as with the met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported yet .
it is possible to em@@ bed an external CSS sty@@ list by pressing the File Open button and selecting the corresponding file .
the cursor is like in a word processor , by moving with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . text can be inserted by typing and del@@ eting using the key or distance key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way on the tool@@ bars , as in the source text editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags in previously existing identical tags is not removed e.g. if an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed each other surrounding anch@@ ors day .
some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the Listen @-@ Assistent are disabled . they will work later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool to examine style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be pursued .
around &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to be able to compile successfully , you need besides &amp; k@@ de ; the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already existing .
stop in a template , at a point in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a file name without path@@ name . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style file fil@@ en@@ ame with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g If for example a sty@@ list file . / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following input is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ age named QNAP or a specified mode name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches with any my@@ QNA@@ ME containing the string template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stopping point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this will be done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each flow .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no reference to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , any number of other useful functions were added later .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , just copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparative windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the merge editor among the differences windows enables resol@@ ving conflicts and simultaneously displays the resulting result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files while merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you merge and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; indicates the exact differences and resist the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you have to check code frequently , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anger when somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other one differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both differ in files .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make your typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . example :
sub@@ folder 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o Dest@@ ination Fol@@ der
open dialog enables manual typing of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . open dialog will remember your selection and shows it next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be executed .
on the folder folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders is started . if for A a file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders .
when merging is enabled , the input field is active and can be edited . however , it is not strictly necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can also complete this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start merging / merging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare an entire file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window .
you can also drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how much these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you need to create two corresponding files , upload them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and inser@@ ting text into another program as cut @-@ out and paste ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the Info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( if the path is too long , let the mouse stand over the line for a while . then a small help@@ window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these default settings can be changed through the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflict in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) good to see .
when differences have been found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + , for example , white characters are relevant only in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks is activated , the line is represented on broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an Info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the file name and &#91; ge@@ aled &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains already text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to find the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative figures are used , each difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the merging column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes by automatic merging , or by manual editing , there is no more line left in the group ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and maybe yet again select another source . this text will not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marking you might copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merging conflicts ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . carefully proceed with this function .
note : when selecting the sources ignore the options numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white signs .
navig@@ ating is mainly used with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side on , side beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end , see how you are used by other programs .
in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the merge operation and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / Str@@ g @-@ picture downward ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the mark to the clip@@ board , you must copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l In@@ sert ) . it also prints the option selection automatically . if this option is enabled , you will automatically copy the Copy button to the clip@@ board and manually copy the manual copy . be careful with this option because you could thus over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board acci@@ dentally .
line end@@ ings are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line @-@ feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved upon completion and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog will also provide fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the selected font does not support this representation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered vibr@@ ated . on these systems the button Pre@@ ferences automatically introduces an un@@ just colour .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , any selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board then drops .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used choice on the used operating system .
the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are not ignored . in this step , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart track \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , while others only save a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually , when this option is checked , auto @-@ return signs may look identical , but how a white character is treated .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
this is useful when white signs are used as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflict in numbers or comments , if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled .
these options are treated in the chapter to scan folders and perform merge tracking . see documentation for the comparison and merge documentation for details .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version is attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . modi@@ fying this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to quit and restart , and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally through the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the top setting is used for all entries .
on the selection fields for coding a short notice appears , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding is individually adjustable for each file , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to set the output of output commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress changes in white characters in the text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ co@@ ded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be displayed next to the normal still a second overview column with the required information .
sometimes you &apos;d rather like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just fade out the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison window next to each other or overl@@ apping . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files . a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et names for the output file . ( if this feature is used to restart the merge again , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first committed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . you can use this feature for example to cut off annoying parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will first hand over to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only at the line distance . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program this by themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this command line for new@@ lines to transform the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 . \ \ U converts the found text into capital letters .
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you &apos;re experim@@ enting with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line distance appropriate . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , i.e. virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of used you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever per@@ l needs some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre @-@ processor will be retained for displaying and merging . other operations only change the data that the new@@ line looks like al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge whole folders recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adapt the proposal before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate the merge and display the simulated changes without really performing them ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed about a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files that were compared to that point will be listed .
when scanning the folder is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left hand side , ...
each file and every folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure will normally be folded up . you can fold a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - , or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open or un@@ fold all folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C columns and the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the collision event cannot be chosen automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type once again .
as seen in the above picture , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their entire contents are identical . then also folders have the same color . in folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ ti@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. when A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. when a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started .
the synchron@@ izing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but are not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; copy &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( unsure ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and performs the newer file for copying . if the files are different but the date is identical , the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , merging the folders cannot be started .
during merging , one file is processed after the other . it indicates the status column when merging was successful , and corresponding other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is OK .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ d ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the contra@@ ctions actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der @-@ Mer@@ ge @-@ Mode , C will be used as the target , and B will be selected as the target and / or B will be used as the target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries in the destination folder should also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all the entries , select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( key short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current item , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merging actions , a message appears indicating the defective items . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all the entries , a dialog box appears with the options Per@@ forming , Simulation and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the real changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is needed ( merge a single file ) , a merging window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select again directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next record .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stum@@ ble on an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem .
if some entries have been individually merged , note &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) will not merge together again . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 settings menu ( Set Pre@@ ferences - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern will be displayed in the element tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many auto @-@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be set in folder specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ or . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hidden attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a previous score indicates a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
if the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder containing a link to itself would result in a loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of solved , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) Full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain level of security . please use caution .
similar to confidentiality of the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal to size . this can be useful e.g. when copying the change date is lost . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
enable synchronization mode if two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical . the results of merging files are also stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is suggested as action instead of merging . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is shut down in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to normal merging of individual files , not just the merging of entire folders .
normally the folder @-@ merge view stays visible while merging single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the option directory &amp; text window to switch off main windows in the Windows menu and switch between the two views using change between directory and text window .
probably you prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , in the directory menu you can also directly merge a single file without first having to run the folder . to do this , use the current file merging from the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not merge again when you start the folder .
this status , however , is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : new read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders .
a path can be relatively und@@ . or .. contained . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modi@@ fying date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option of confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose is at present as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; indicates that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then cap@@ tures &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch will start to recover the missing file .
in kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Def@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; being executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the part mode .
there are already tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is compact ) . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge together like the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for quite a while and have learned a lot by watching in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go this way .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably don &apos;t have the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( eg k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will first be treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines , next to each other , this is is but this p@@ is more often the case .
the editor notes each difference in the files where it starts and where it finishes . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create a separate file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit large amounts of text , another editor should be used .
if text is removed suddenly ; no sr@@ c is left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be confusing and miss the purpose . please use a different editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of last changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake is used , you should not have any problems with compile it . however , if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) into the clip@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ paste ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replace the current selection .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options . )
there are only entries displaying differences . this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior is likely to be dis@@ continued in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the button A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , clicking the button will be removed accordingly .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and with several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work areas as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button you can move windows within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work@@ tops .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has the two entries P@@ ager . when cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maximize , on desktop and exit . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and can also be moved to other work areas .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
cross this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is enabled along with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
when this field is enabled , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty working areas are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classi@@ cally let &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N Ra@@ ster appear , as known from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops appear in a horizontal row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents . in addition , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ections of switch ... lets the dialog appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ d . if you do not have a write per@@ missions for the file , you must register as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent@@ Mode and assign a value to it . possible values are :

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; view a part of the screen as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag ; a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the magni@@ fied area of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a drop @-@ down window .
in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cursor as a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse cursor . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cursor .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key or use the &amp; M@@ b ; you can move the drop @-@ down window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the drop @-@ down window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ down window remains solid and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save into a file , paste into the clip@@ board ( to insert it into other applications later ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the CPU time to be set against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a drop @-@ down window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and decrease &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use an area of the screen so as if you would like to use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designers or visually impaired .
you can find more detailed user documentation with help : / K@@ mag ( either enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or run help@@ center help : / K@@ mag ) .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor leaves for a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from the peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain . moreover , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , due to the mere desire of the mouse , pain may also be caused . suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , if this has not yet happened .
to make it even clearer : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you stop the movement briefly .
the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it em@@ ulated the pressing of the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can drag the drag by pressed mouse button .
this dwell time must be blocked after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if the intel@@ lect is switched on , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait , before releasing the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse takes place .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this function is activated , a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ ller ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to do this , go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound system and here the General tab . there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
when this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last move of users .
best use it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with default settings . in particular , the smart move should be turned off at first . if you have become accustomed to the automatic mouse click , you can later assume the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in the case of sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or places in the browser window that does not show a link will not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually fairly simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to take out the mouse ball . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear quickly when you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you need to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use smart offset in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you have a mouse click on it . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very likely to mark the text , copy it to the clip@@ board , or to execute any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . however , it will probably only once cause problems . here are some advice about this :
do not use smart move if you just start using the m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click on an end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will be used every time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the intelligent link even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X windows ; this should be the case on most systems already .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter persi@@ sts . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome , causing pain to be pressed .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a dra@@ gging process to start , before releasing the mouse button . in this way , dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging with the mouse can also be performed .
you can find more detailed user documentation with help : / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ( enter either this &amp; URL ; in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or run help@@ center help : / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ) .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; was developed by Gun@@ n@@ ar Sch@@ mi D@@ t Gun@@ n@@ ar @ schm@@ i @-@ d@@ t@@ .de , Ola@@ f Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ midt @ k@@ de@@ .org and Jeff Rous@@ h Jeff @ m@@ ous@@ eto@@ ol@@ .com .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which dum@@ b users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the conversation history pro@@ positions which are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . you will find more details in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ book . from the text passages you can often select used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for the word extension . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the word extension .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sets ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and an inline memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have K@@ mouth ; correctly set up , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the drive memory . you can select from it sets which are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the side of the word extension as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the box map , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding , with the text passed to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possibility to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a voice service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , der &amp; k@@ de ; - Applications a standardized interface for voice output , and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N .
with the first drop @-@ down sel@@ ector action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text passages book or in the box for text passages .
with the choice of instant message , the selected text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the memory storage . by selecting Add to the input field , the selected text passage is first entered into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down of the editing window for text passages , you can determine if the text match book is to be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
the book stores the book with the selection of text passages . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text match book will not be saved . select Before Cho@@ osing , will be saved &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text match is to be stored .
the Wor@@ ter@@ itory Page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word extension . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with the buttons to the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary on the input field and in the drop @-@ down box .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they are to be wei@@ ghted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the short@@ cut short@@ cut . if you have selected a text match , you can only change its name .
you can either add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either through the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the storage memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the storage memory .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sets of the default memory .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default over the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
once this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with clu@@ es over the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding line for text passages is displayed with entries . by default , the tool@@ bar is located directly below the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
you probably don &apos;t have the command for the voice output correct or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the map voice output . ( see settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to further details . )
festival is a language edition system at the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . the license allows to use the festival free of charge and to spread without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival will be installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to freely use Free@@ T@@ TS without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option to send data as default input must be enabled . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German lyrics into phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax would like to swallow the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently under development in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but that depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who can &apos;t speak can be able to print text by the computer . it is stored in a list of already spoken sentences , which the user can always print out again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
you can find more detailed user documentation with help : / k@@ mouth ( please enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or run help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service , which allows each application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers ready to use their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; posters ; even if &amp; posters ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are embedded .
the speech output takes place via the program speech emul@@ ator , which uses various background programs such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables creation of language editions on the command line ( or using shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .
in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Met@@ a Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the &amp; k@@ de voice output service ; an application without any visible window , the T@@ TS service via &amp; d@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configur@@ ing and setting kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor , with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you can find the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ ä . the developers can also be found in the I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ ä ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need to install and correct program speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ chers . see also
at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card @-@ card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have arranged at least one speaker , the card card General is displayed .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use , since the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the flash@@ card reader in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the card @-@ card speaker is displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to push the speaker in the list down one line to the bottom . the order of the speakers in the list is also their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select a voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the map . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the card card General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the card card orders to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language dispens@@ ing system from &amp; k@@ de ; click the General tab in General to open this card . here you can set some general options .
this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card is displayed , and you can create text jobs and read . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically when reading the check@@ bar , it disappears again as soon as the previous reading is finished .
with buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , stop and record text jobs .
with buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the card card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and cross the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read and select in the main menu Tools Text . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step also , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ he@@ aders and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; Plac@@ ards ; the Advanced text editor by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can preview displayed text . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read and select the Text Editor main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works when &amp; backs ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ not@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system , which informs you about events defined by you . you can read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can set up a message when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ not@@ fy , a menu entry appears noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ fy differ depending on the application .
filters for string replacement provide a good way in &amp; kt@@ ts ; incorrect or er@@ ron@@ eous messages to correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is provided by &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by the mail , and also the print@@ out / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ osed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the program speech speaker . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the working methods of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differs from four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained commissions will continue .
al@@ erts have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the issue of warning .
news is the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a web page , you can welcome someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest is simple text assignments . every order you use from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such read , this issue is stopped and terminated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
string plac@@ ers replace parts of a text by other text . you can specify the parts to be replaced , either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre@@ defined string translator filters that enable the creation of Chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ conver@@ ters use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format .
with voice selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the map @-@ card speaker , you can read text by K@@ DE news about it . read about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , the text will remain unchanged to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; - Noti@@ fication to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the page below . editing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed below .
for setting up string translation filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparative patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it must differ only from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column matching and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Cre@@ ating . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , store or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks one of the languages recorded here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application @-@ ID running programs will be available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; you have to om@@ it the number of applications . if for example , and q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copy .
the string substitute filter is applied to the text only if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if identical . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing the words , the string substitute filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must be del@@ im@@ ited on both sides by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) .
in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in di@@ alogs adding or editing as help to merge these expressions . the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the k@@ de@@ uti@@ ls package .
XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such form@@ ulations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient .
the speaker selection filter allows you to send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card @-@ card speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . you can , for example , specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the spokesperson for the program that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speakers installed on the map card .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the specified regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can invoke it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to get faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the subscri@@ ber you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . click the button on the right to display the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is applied to the text only if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .

none of the above language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ envelope filter , but when using the module for festival websites , web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to allow S@@ able to work at all . you must also do that if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program is installed x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c and can be found about the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or just chew@@ ing f@@ lange is issued . what can I do about it ?
first of all , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string offset filter .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . check the website of kt@@ ts ; for information which is not yet included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to add &amp; kt@@ ts ; you want to expand for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text archive for k@@ de@@ .de or downloaded the currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , make sure speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do this , you can use the shell script SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed so that the setup of speech emul@@ ators is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can go back to sentence or paragraph , repeat , stop or cancel the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , you can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female , this will be used , otherwise the best suitable spokes@@ man will be used . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , look in .
if you click Add speaker on the map and click Add a Spe@@ aker to the list or click Edit , the map icon display device will be displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details on the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , you only have to enter festival .
select the text encoding for text that is handed over to the festival . when voices are known , this setting is automatically done . generally speaking , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
these sliding controls allow you to adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controls and display this gray , the voice selected by you will not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . when you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized more quickly .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or forget to click App@@ ly ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the program window appears t@@ m@@ gr at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check@@ box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the just edited sentence . the Spe@@ aker ID corresponds to column ID on the map spokes@@ man .
with buttons in this row , you can set the order in the order , which is selected in the list below , forward or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
by clicking OK , all settings of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card card audio . see also .
here only text jobs are listed and managed . outputs of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information about the information types of kt@@ ts , see .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or kt@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % is equivalent to half and 20,000 . % about twice the normal speech speed . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select Standard .
on this map you can set up specific actions that are executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; handles four types of voice orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . once the output of the screen reader has been read , the retained commissions will be resum@@ ed .
al@@ erts have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
news is the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room .
a text application is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introductory sound and introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this card card only apply to normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of screen re@@ actors there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ not@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the map card will appear .
select this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications where a sound is played are deleted by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone is mentioned in an I@@ RC message your nick@@ name .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this drop @-@ down sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter the properties of the desired speaker here . default select the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the list of speakers as top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels of events . if an action is specified for a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the pre @-@ read al@@ erts as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . use the load button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks for voice control , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) since this is the default voice , the festival used in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ s ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! Doc@@ type speak PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN .
there are two types of filters - normal filters and set border recognition filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . this can start &amp; kt@@ ts , as only the first set must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can also skip or stop orders by way of the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
here you see the set border recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set @-@ rate recognition filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add further set limits recognition filters , beginners will get dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn the setup of the speaker selection by ex@@ iting . switch off the list of speakers and specify text to read . switch on the list of speakers , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
you can then stop or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set border recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limits recognition filter compare text with a regular expression for Stat@@ utes and insert a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab character is automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set limit recognition filter retains the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ not ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ actors .
if you have removed the normal set limit detection filter , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the flash@@ card reader selection you can over@@ ride the speakers settings for the application . the card card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the upper@@ most on the card @-@ card speaker ) . in other words , no speaker properties are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the properties of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which corresponds best to the originally set properties .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select here the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything .
mark this check box if the property will have priority over other properties . you can also set several markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language lies ahead if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to delete all the properties in the speaker area that is closest to the following , click on the default speaker switch and then use the speaker that is closest to the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text assignment in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is 0 required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get back@@ tracking .

I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it at festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr shows this voice not .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / vocals . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers .
in order to do this , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ded modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the map for speaker systems . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite bold , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML res@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set up the speaking speed .

before you start , first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported .
you must install at least one language . help do so in the instructions delivered with festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
you need to compile an additional module for these voices , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you have to enter for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding should be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , syn@@ thesizer . then festival takes over le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this dic@@ tation . festival generates this by &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate Di@@ phones from German text .
in this process additional w@@ rap@@ pers code is added to festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; folders but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under
I@@ MS German festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 the recording of the error correc@@ tions is not required , you only need to re @-@ translate the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; this allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNA settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting a k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware does not install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed in the installation of &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be charged by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform to select from the list that matches the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . selecting the setting non @-@ re @-@ en@@ quiries can be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically set .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system management mode , click the System Administr@@ ative Mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system administration mode , the complete functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Reiter Network interfaces :
the set @-@ up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button ... setup in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show dialog with further options .
with the option Automati@@ cally , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system will be carried out at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at any system start , so no further setting is required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP should be selected according to the system .
with the option manually , the TCP / IP configuration can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the network mask , the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
depending on the need , network devices can be activated or switched off . switching on a switched @-@ out network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
depending on the need , network devices can be activated or switched off . switching off an activated network device can be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
speci@@ fies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located has to be selected .
a computer with DNA support replaces a full domain address by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer requires ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution part of the name resolution allows a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be sorted by selecting a single entry and down@@ gra@@ ding or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons down or down@@ wards in priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution select an entry and then click the Edit button . it will show the Edit dialog .
the list named calcul@@ ator describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually , the list of names in particular contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add .... Add New alias dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add button . if the known machine has multiple ali@@ ases names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a particular known machine from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to edit hosts will be shown .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to enable the changes , the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installing binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installing the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; install with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is recommended to experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; alter@@ able configuration files are discussed .
this area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network is conveyed .
currently IP networks are run with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread dis@@ semination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently concentrating on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is assigned to a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point which has a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are mostly used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 42 ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding .
the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed in DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is a different content than specified in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

before a band can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; h@@ ult the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detect &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad on the tape doesn &apos;t , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .

if everything went smooth , the symbol for the tape drive is changed to indicate that the tape was mounted . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by un@@ folding the item for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be resolved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates by changing the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used for storing data . if your tape drive requires that a tape is format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted before use . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require a format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format of the tape continues . all data on the tape are lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically included and is ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only save this file or folder .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files once and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings dialog , the dialog appears backup . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click on any of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for the review .
if you have confirmed the review settings , the dialog appears to be checked . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ direct the restore , the files to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and choose Rec@@ over ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the recovery settings , the dialog will appear again . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re @-@ create the index on two ways :
this creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , only those files that are located on the same file system , such as the folder . folders lying on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is viewed from tar independently from the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to as@@ certain the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved , the command is loaded to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; block the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , when releasing the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically dis@@ car@@ ded the tape . do not use this option at flo@@ ppy spre@@ aders .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover one memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that the band has been format@@ ted since the time .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work unless they are incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system will store the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system log ; experienced users can quickly access information about issues that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system puts the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system log allows experienced users to access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features that allow the protocol files to be filtered and evaluated by specific programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes among other things :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a log file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start tries &amp; k@@ system log ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will open to you , and it opens instead of that a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not started with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log folder , for which normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or string . the list of the log rows will now be changed automatically , so that only log @-@ lines will be displayed that match the selected filter . then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can , of course , also select another entry . the string of the filter search concept will then only be matched with the entries in the correspon@@ dingly selected column . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol lines sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . minutes lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than protocol lines of the level indicator . the colored display of minutes lines can be switched off in the direction dialog .
if you want to display only certain processes ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can enable to skip to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new incoming protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system log ; allows to display multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more recent information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system log ; you will also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system quickly develops into the standard for the control of the program starts when driving the system in &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ in@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without installing a new installation and re@@ format@@ ting . the &amp; Linux kernel looks first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you can find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service that you want to start at the boot of the system or when switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also use a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . be very careful if you have confused something , then you get it repaired by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does all the correct scripts start ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one has a K , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument .
some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level that lets you run only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could also have a user running level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by dra@@ gging it somewhere else . this will only happen if you remove an entry from the area of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new level , you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to recover entries that have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the different work areas ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it to clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired running level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sort number or name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , it will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to preferences are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard running level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly re@@ bo@@ unding . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE , or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately not standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check that all configuration files are present ( and whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end with no message if their configuration files are not present or false .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that it can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user ; read .
after you &apos;ve made any changes , you must save them . either you use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog for user and group properties .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings . only if you have limited space constraints ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can customize individual settings . additional flash@@ cards appear , if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , as installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the card password management will appear , if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , as installed in BSD UNIX .
this card card only appears if space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized for at least one installed fil@@ esystem ( see the file quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the limited space restrictions in KB :
these parameters can be individually set for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected using the array file system with space limitation .
the card card groups inform about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group belonging to the user can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group &apos;s dialog properties include a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group , or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analogue .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add the default operating system , remove , add , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
