<seg id="1">You can translate the module website in & konqueror; menu under Extras website. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated in place of the entire URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. in the best case, babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations do not make any important decisions depending on the translation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated to the Babelfish page itself, where you can paste text to translate.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror;. despite their small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them more easily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions you can find in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; choose settings extensions... Open the map tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings modules from the box kde; addons. please note that possibly more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click & Conqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module view filter (also called Folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras address filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror; select Extras DOM-tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the displayed website. as default starts the display with the root node of the document, example: documentelement, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The & FSView; for & konqueror; represents a further view for objects using the MIME-Type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of presenting nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree map. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; the size is the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be detected, even if it lies far below in the folder hierarchy. thus, & FSView may be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and label settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can be either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or mapping of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether it is present at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangle should be used (whereby, therefore, display error caused by restrictions on the character of the treemap). furthermore, you can set the relative position of the labeling in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of representation algorithms for Treemaps the rule should be observed that the area is proportionately to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView; this target is not always maintained. it will be drawn to indicate the nesting of the entries, and that frame will need space that is no longer available to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to divide the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here it is always advantageous for the inscribing and avoiding space losses by frame, that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu entry view. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; used as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget designed for KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module image gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras picture gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the picture gallery, a dialog opens, with which you can set the appearance of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">To display the file name of the image, specify whether the file names are displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">To view the file size of the image, specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, you can determine if the size of the images below the thumbnails is displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog folder, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the" "" "Save HTML File" "" "file selection, specify where the HTML page is to be saved." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">With the subfolder to include the subfolder, you can set the subfolder to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy original images with the original images to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the commentary box comment section, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original images.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings provides you with easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">You can find the media playback for the navigation pane in the & konqueror; menu under Windows navigation pane or with the shortcut shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click in the navigation area of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror; add that you can change browser and operating system recognition for single domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change browser detection in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the code in MSIE for pages that reject access with browsers based on Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser detection to call with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser detection is used for all pages of the website you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the scope of the information on the browser and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; module check your & CSS; style templates and & HTML; documents in accordance with the recommendations of W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">You can check the module website in the & konqueror; menu under Extras website. you can make the following exams:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; check out if your & HTML; document of the syntax of HTML; corresponds to all found errors are displayed. with this check, you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to review your & CSS; style sheets that are embedded in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; document. with valid & CSS; your websites have a uniform appearance independent of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Check the links on your page to redirects and faulty links. recursively all links on the website are checked recursively.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you set the addresses of the servers for verification of your & HTML; documents and & CSS; style sheets.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module Web-archiver for & konqueror; you can store web pages with text and images in .html format.</seg>
<seg id="53">With the mouse click on Extras website and a dialog appears to save the displayed website.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface will be provided to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image plug-in interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works complete in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or lens to search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also digitised; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvements.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; attempts to make the detox of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error report system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of & digikam. however, in this mailing list, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also download the digicam; homepage to learn about released versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved is to log in to the developer mailing list. instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">For the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data abnk is stored. this path remains the same for all picture folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later, you can add as many folders as you would like. & digikam; you will additionally use as an AlbenLibrary. settings digiKam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folders. & digikam; see each subfolder as an album. no image is changed. during the search of the folder you get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; durst recursively the library path in all its depth. you cannot exclude subfolders unless it is in hidden folders. this can be done by inserting one point in front of the subfolder's name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change the photos by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can be in & digikam; set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use my albums and my keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, you can also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow sections.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface will be provided to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk device. the connection can also be realized via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">GPhoto2 supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. see this link for a complete list of supported cameras.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support to reliably read the thumbnails of digiKam. Exif support is required by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the thumbnails. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might be unable to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the nicest things to do is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plug-in Interface Project (manual) is an approach a common modular structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier to complete & digikam. by writing a small module to complete a function, the changes made in & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page strings with & LMB; remove or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can lay a picture in another part of the Albendable, above the horizontal divider line or into another application window. the only limitation is that one picture cannot be placed in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selector allows you to highlight the most common files: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the filename works only if it is shown in the symbol view. which fields can be displayed, you can configure in the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & edited are stored in a single albumtree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">In order to copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it down. in the then appearing menu you will have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy multiple photos in the same way. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to give you information about this collection. to access the album properties, you have to right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you use will be used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete collections from the collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View Album sort by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons eldest, average, new testers: these set the date on the oldest, the newest picture or the section of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first entered an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and set it in the context menu & quot; As Album preview; additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included only in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be displayed in this album in the image window. each photo will be displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a short while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this in which you can re-create all thumbnails in the Extras menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview. what information these are, you can change the settings edited; set up the albums page and adjust the preview images to your preferences.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have auxiliary windows, which appear. if you allow the mouse cursor to rest at a moment above a picture. the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the section introduction to the main window shows such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos and tags allow you to organize your pictures as you like. image processing shows your photos and allows you to make a number of improvements on these. you can get all the features possible using the preview or menu image in the menu bar. you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image processing with a photo by clicking either F4 Picture Edit... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit... select. in the editing section, you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos. image editing allows you to view and edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may occur that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File menu. for this, and how to customize them to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs there may be problems with the metadata included in the image. some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image. this information is lost from EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Turning. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right click the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digikam, it is moved to the trash bin of & kde; move. F8 Image Delete or Del In case you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My Datumslistequot; organizes your photos based on the data. & digikam; uses either the EXIF date or, if it is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or finding a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword listequot; to fold so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also use your keywords in other programs as well. in addition, the keywords are re-imported when the data is lost; the images are noted.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My keyword; or click on an existing keyword and then select new keyword. if you click on an existing keyword, after clicking on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the substitch of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and deleting. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there. then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to move the keyword. a keyword can only be once in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and selecting keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, select the picture with the right mouse button and select as Album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To be able to exploit the functionality with keywords, you must first have your photos with keywords. this can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want with a keyword, you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword, draw and drop there. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select keyword from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can select a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can use a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you right-click the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the key menu. the menu only displays the keywords attached to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The time beam view shows a time-based adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved by this histogram. to select a timeframe, you only have to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection box, which indicates the time unit. this displays all the associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the bottom of the box you can enter a title and save your selection. then this appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Cover all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="125">When you click on it, the filtering will be deleted and all the pictures will be displayed again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with binoculars. if you open this, you can save a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search that always filters what you entered as a search criterion. after you have saved it, it appears filters in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are happy with your choice, press OK and search will be performed. the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after the search, you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit search, the search form will appear again with the search information you entered. if you select as an advanced search, the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for the search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Search in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced Search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. all rules are displayed in line, separated by operators. an option can be added to this list using search group / search group or deleted from it.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar one. if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of the inaccurate search in the left side bar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand ink sketch: draw a fast sketch and & digitite; find the matching pictures. also here, a swellvalue can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can zoom in or zoom out with the mouse wheel. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates will be filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the bottom of the box you can specify a name for your geo filter. it will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geodestination.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a lamp in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image data formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem illuminated console from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated console and open its window. if you are back in & digikam window, you can quickly open the illuminated console with L Extras.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview window, you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right corner of the window. a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select preview from the toolbar and perform Zoo and Imposition operations on one of the pictures, then these are also executed with the other image. you can therefore compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly locate from a picture series. if you use pairs of pairs from the toolbar, then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas to the same. now use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to view it in the right-hand side. this simplifies it through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the illuminating table, e.g. F4 File Editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to combine visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each section you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to swing the visible area of the image, you have to click it and hold the & LMB; then both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Zoom as well as in other views. just use the zoom-controller under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images if you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos leads a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to back up your pictures, find, protect, and reuse photos. we focus on the process for digital photographers that have & digikam. we look at the download, rename, delete, group, review, review, refine, archive, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, confectioned and exported contents that have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data via data. in accordance with your definition, metadata is data that provides information about or a documentation of other data which are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your machine then you will need to find a certain photo no longer. if you do not even know how many photos you have then use certainly not & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough pictures then you will be using subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements, such as versioning the photos, archiving, work sequences, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% working files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to save the metadata option in & digikam. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do this, & digikam, provides them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should now assign keywords, captions and an assessment to each picture. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in the next work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's with keywords, keywords, as you are often called in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import katalogised images from a different source with embedded keywords, then & digikam. automatically build the tree for you or place the pictures in the right place. modifying the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by pulling a sub-tree onto another. the changed keywords are edited by & digikam; updated while it pursues the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone see your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you're sure to be interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I'm telling you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! one starts dreaming of having associations, memories, the historical period of time is present again, you may even hear the silence. so the labeling has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos is the title possibly more important than the picture itself to generate an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him about the motive that moved you to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a labeling for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as caption. you can even export it to a selection of images. KDE even provides you with a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already moving with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of exploiting the geolocation are already uncountable and will become even deeper in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geo-geo. & digikam. you can also export kml files that you can use with GoogleEarth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information came from & digikam, as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for the author's line): associated with the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples of this can be titles such as: Employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for vendor): use the provider field to identify who works the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here, which you provide the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill in the author and copyright sections, although they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculators can delete or modify this in the picture. for private individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digikam, will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failures, current shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of memory media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. this kind of loss is the same that can happen to you even with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we deal with problems with the so called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics showing the reasons for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these precautions need to be dealt with and you may not take longer than a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, more difficult to get and much more expensive. there are offers via gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection, they are used by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a cheap program called IsoBuster which apparently works wonders in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recorder to high-quality media in a non-propriety format. then read the data again to check it. likewise, you should copy the media with a description, date & author and then store on a clean, dark dry and protected spot. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read the media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Your manufacturer's specifications include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the failure mechanisms of hard drives on this topic: disk Study</seg>
<seg id="187">In short: discos are longest if you operate in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower tempers, the error rate increases dramatically. some of the errors identified by SMART indicate the immediate impending failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices don't matter much, this is different in devices with computer chips and high speed processor. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboard and other defects. so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against power peaks is a surge protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy slots and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector ridge.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection then you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strike and thus protects the right connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should ensure that even all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems. some manufacturers also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and therefore very small and also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power outage occurs. some models allow them to continue working until the current expires. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of current problems with the cost of avoiding it. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your machine is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux; Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and in the big companies there is a backup and a distributed memory in the offer.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk errors on low levels and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle launched its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. it is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; but it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% on workstation systems. in notebooks already the proportion of thefts amounts to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to less damage, e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely stored before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical borders. it is meant that while the technology develops further there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are moving towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even though this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather worse. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't blame anybody else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. therefore, secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like installing your operating system, the exchange of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you do your backup on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash hits you if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aviation accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention means always a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as said above, a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that should be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential fuse: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time that such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images directly after saving them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file IPTC information, associated XMP files, original storage, storage, scalability, media, re-finding images and metadata, copying the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you need to consider all that is being told today with caution and re-evaluate while time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way to ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to assess the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: each time you change your computer architecture, your memory and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk was detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs and dollar; resize2fs / dev / sdc1 # change the size of rpm if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market, so you shouldn't use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color allocation for heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open raw format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already provide DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will also use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mix of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive a copy of your photo, mostly in the raw format. XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as noted above, the raw format can be changed. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it all together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization supporting a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in DCMI communities and DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard links and enlightening efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera edit, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a subtle editing you can use external programs. if you edit the images again, edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut from other programs under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them to web galleries only, encode in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into & digikam. in the Add a Photos to an album, you will find a description how to add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, connect it to the computer, turn the camera on display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is established, a feral indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the file association are displayed on the camera for each file, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the page features properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an item or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata tab shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all. this downloads all photos from your camera to a single album in & digikam. when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the photos were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired with the default selection methods of & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the button download and then download Selected. the Selected button is download as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New is available. these images have not been downloaded yet. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, you will of course only download the new images.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you use the All Download or Selected button, a dialog appears to be able to select the target album in which the photos are stored. you can read the list of existing albums, like normal folders. then select the album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digikam. download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once by deleting the Delete All button. if you just want to delete some, you must select it first and delete selected Delete selected.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a & digicam; album downloaded before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera body completely, you should do so using the camera bed, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The filenames are usually used again after the photos from the camera were deleted. this can result in double filenames if you upload photos of different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder per day will be created automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer will open three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two affect the data on the author in the standard AutoriIdentity section. if you select this, the relevant entries from the Exif information will be copied into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish a different date format than the default format, for example, in the editing field you can use the prefix photo-% Y-%% d% H:% M:% S. turn on the Date & Time option. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file name, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters. or in uppercase letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digikam. used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. its settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiosan; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the point of time recording to perform an automatic rotation during downloading. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, it lets & digikam; the photo in its original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date that the photo was made available, & digikam, this can be used to automatically load sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data sidebar, you can read what information your camera might have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case stores & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn this option on. to do so, use the Advanced button and select the option Date-based submites at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button download. select then upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digikam. you, where the images are to be uploaded. a folder selector dialog for the camera appears. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a generic term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in latitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. the data can be calculated by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can click a browser to open the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digikam, users wanting to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it's good to record the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailers and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to store these data in the GPX format, as this is the only format supported by the geo-mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the latitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script which works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the wildcards compiled by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; tries to give you so much control over his work processes as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digikam. to access these settings, you need to set up the Settings menu in the Settings menu. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing. you set the default behavior of & digikam; note if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for the author's status: this field should include the professional title of the photographer. this can be designations such as hired photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the author's field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate that the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if this is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here since they offer the image to others & quot;. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC rims. this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & digikam. this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image labels as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments that you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. this allows your captions to be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor rests in the main window above a file. depending on the option selected, this information will appear or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify what file types & digikam; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. each file in one & digikam; album folder that has none of these extensions has been edited by & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">You can set these settings if possible. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size loading quot; should you only use on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar when you use image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image. these colors are defined here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma subsampling refers to the fact that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia to the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality because PNG requires a lossless algorithm. the only effect is that the image data requires more time for training and unpacking. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option of compressing TIFF files, you can switch the compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect image quality since the Deflate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, image editing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently, it evolves quickly to a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default acceptance is that all green pixels are the same. if the straight-line green pixels of the CCD sensor react with sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a mesh pattern in output. this option draws the picture a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 mesh patterns with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. default is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default it is the Spitz Lights, so the parts of your images are burned in, because of the inability of your camera to capture the spider lights in the settings. the setting colors release some unusual results, as they indicate the top lights in various rose tones. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red ones. and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the reconstruct option, you get the possibility to set a level. here a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the digicam; image processing. in order to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial data that come from the color-filtered image sensor, which have many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour-construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm that was used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for gradient correction since it is done during the rough conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as color information from a colour space to translate into the other is that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior issues when an image is opened in image editing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Reset the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC where you can save all your profiles. & digikam; examine this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the option & quot; default squot; for your profiles to leave. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures color does not manage the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain color tapping or gamma correction. at present, dcraw Gamma doesn't correct conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile that you can emulate as your image would be given from one device again. this is very useful before printing pictures as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for them for what purpose. unfortunately not on the models of Canon. therefore, here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by providing this interface, & digikam can support; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and they will be uploaded by & digikam. these modules will appear as new entries in the main window and in addition you will find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) via KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper regulator adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check fields turn the metadata into or out, which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show a list of all currently supported cameras on the left. on the right-hand side there is a button automatic detection, which attempts to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode. currently, Serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage is supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). this field is only active if you have selected a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, where you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digikam, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it into the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check out whether & digikam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can manually set camera models and port. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it will be displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can paste it all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the Option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; View images in the trash bin, you can set the conversation of & digikam; for deleting a photo in an album. in the sections clearing a photo and deleting an album, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can be implicitly supported by & digikam; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without questioning. otherwise, you will need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the greeting image of & digikam; suppress when starting. this accelerates under certain circumstances the start process of & digikam..</seg>
<seg id="334">Setting Beim Start for new photos compels & digikam, to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extended the starting time of & digikam. if something was deleted from the base folder, & digikam, you know if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & digikam; use to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the Toolbar Settings window. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digikam; contains a fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview and selecting the item Display / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam. you may not be part of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image processing are changing your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you save the file or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it. you can save this with file Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by restoring or restoring the image processing button in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you've done on the photo since the last saved.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually every action of image editing can be reversed or restored. the last action you can undo by editing undo or restore by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and write Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; on the back or restore button in the toolbar a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reverted or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes in the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and zoom in the picture in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select Enlarge factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you enter the normal view in which you use the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can change this in the edit dialog by & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select image in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. whole image pages can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export Assistant. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digikam; main window has a sidebar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available without the navigation file, even in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into the EXIF and IPTC fields so you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the Apply button or simply change to the next picture, the captions will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows an evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written to the IPTC field urgency. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keywords and a selection box with the keywords used before in this & edited; session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given search word. you can easily restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further simplification for the input of keywords in a series of images. if you have typed different keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding tick boxes in the tree. all keywords in an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If you select multiple images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to have a selection with a keyword, please read the section keywords.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar with their album, - date, keyword and search view is used. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right, only the intersection of these two will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and drop keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears that asks you if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is based on No keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. you have been selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off among Settings Various.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have created and created a rule and state that it should be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry you are looking for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can, for example, specify an advanced search on all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the grouping button. the options will then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly got it to & edited; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that colors that come from your camera or scanner will have predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish in the web to those of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject comes to color management, then everyone would like to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. additionally, links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed choices to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are by email or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and life is so easy for everyone, why should you use a different color space and have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB limits compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2 dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callibrate my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you have to callibrate your monitor, since sRGB is running on sRGB. if you work as a color space of sRGB, then you have to use either your monitor to the sRGB standard, use an appropriate monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve an image in most cases. therefore, please use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, compare, Automatic Compare and Contrast Enhancement from the menu Conducer Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the fluorescent values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">This method adjusts the luminance factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity canal becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the same number of pixels produces very good results, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle at a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balance: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a re-justification of all values in between. this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited since a color space is worked with 8-bit per color. so if you can be far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, then your options for correcting are better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side both the original picture and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original white balance, then it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel on this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right, a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images that most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow alignment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result displayed in the white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons store as and load exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved in a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button resets all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you save it, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the coding depth for each color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for use of color profiles can be used to rate the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find tone-value correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always needs the same error and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digicam; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a channel filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the brighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solarisation. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further upliftment ultimately generates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar power effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity amounts to 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquire; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquire; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeat the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminance of the photo. you can experiment the different color levels of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem: a too large saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous / contrast / gamma, the tool is set to improve the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you only need the area of the slide for the purpose described here. concrete the three slider below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three slider are clicked into and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the slider to see how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left hand side are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for pictures of a digital camera the linear diagram is mostly dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gammages.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pipettes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input of shadows, middle and light tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a light image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later. to do this, the Gimp Level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three pipettes, the input value is automatically readjusted for all shadows, medium and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the histogram application for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overlay Indicator option controls all color channels in order to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjustment of the entries applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifying channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most meaningful. for pictures with large ranges of constant color, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a crankshaft to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker expressions and that the associated image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue- and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overlay Indicator option controls all color channels in order to display overexposed pixels. if found in more than one channel, you get the combined result displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the Luminance Channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & digicam channel blender; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel blender is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel blender for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first notice how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and output. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed compared to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image a vertical line in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the right: controller for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you want to preserve Luminance, the image will retain the overall brightness even if you change the corresponding color components. this is particularly convenient if you also use the option Monochrome since the channel blender then is THE tool for creating great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color. color space consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose diamond pattern is different in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the color.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer setting you can save for later and load it. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overlay Indicator option controls all color channels in order to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re-adjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the processed image under (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of film rolls profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford Hall F Plus, Ilford Panf Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with orange lens filters. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red liner filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lunar light rays at the time of the day. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotate filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow liner filter. this is the most natural color setting and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm light and middle tones while adding a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and re-development in a sepiatpad. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digicam; use tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and the three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual defect has been applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) to be seen. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicam; tool frame can be added a decorative frame to be added a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a possibility to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your image. the image is surrounded by a coloured line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), shkantet surrounds it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into an image at any location. this also works in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you chose for your text can be changed by pressing the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicam; tool template you can apply a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu Image Template apply in image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compressing (9) to diminish the file size of the template. if you want to add your template, send an e-mail in English to the & digikam; mailinglist digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select here the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings will be scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view mirrors the folder structure of the template folder. the selection of a folder updates the thumbnail of the stencils automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller size: this button resumes the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you have to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image lying under the template. then take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to use the template on your image. the image will then automatically adjust the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but creates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper look. actually sharpens it not a bit, it works rather psychotropic. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapour and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus and most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process colors with only minimal differences to one color point. this in turn results in sharp edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras typically require more after sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images a camera is often used in internal sharpening. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field of sharpness already during reading the picture. if you disable it, you will get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the focus of sharpness. you can call this with the menu entry Korrigieren Schärfen.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful with this because the results do not work very naturally: sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but intensifies the noise. generally, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to soften the soft mark with the menu entry Correcting softeners and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried at first. an increase in the radius or the amount amplify the effect. if you make the sharpness mask too strong, hash and the impression of grates will produce close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, they should best sharpens images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference-amount. thus one can define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter. thus areas with a soft change between the sounds are exempted from the sharpen and hence beauty defects in faces, heavens and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the sharp masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). blurred mask has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swellvalue = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicam; tool refocused a picture through improvement of sharpness. it used the copyrighted discharging filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to get a picture & quot; refocused; in which it reverses the default. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna filtering. refocused mostly achieves better results than blurred mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauss's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also depends on the source pixies that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß's folding is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filters: an increase of the noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. however, if the smoke filter is too low, the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter when your sharpness Gauß is crag. this is most often caused by a previously executed blurring filter. in most cases, you should let this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauss's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow when you select great values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The save as and load buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will thus be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cutting, color and intensity adjustments on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not visible immediately, but later leave some unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by sharp masking a larger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masking must always create artefacts. even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of blurring. for the Wiener filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpening in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothes the sharpness of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different preferences as starting points to simplify restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a smooth smoothing over the image. whereas larger values are mainly smoothing and details are sharp. a value of 0.9 should get details in such a way that no sharpening should be changed afterwards. please note that the detail maintenance should always be subordinated to the direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions, while a value close to 1 is only smoothed in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD rouches will produce a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best eliminated at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor via all. p then defines the relative smoothing. set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is traversed. normally, here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle stepwidth da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never taller than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal. it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons store as and load exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very quick at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove picture errors with little artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was taken in Guatemala City by an analog camera. as you see, there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that caused by a poor film shift during the trip.</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other artifacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor screws from camera or moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius checks the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing that the filter looks forward to detect light density changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubricating occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: check the edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without loosing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve the image. these settings do not influence the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamblers of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically more severely roughed.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the adjustment of the phase adjusting attenuation. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, hash and phasenjitter appear at the edges. it can remove smoke tips and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for reducing noise you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is labeled with (1) and the corrected with (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to soften the soft mark with the menu entry Correcting softeners and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: compression JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons store as and load exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very quick at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious cinematography on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were reduced to an old color photo that was scanned with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image can be viewed under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The digicam; tool Hotpixel allows hot pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera close to eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially with high-quality raw-mode photos, because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels; and 'quot; bright pixel quot; in a photo with a dark photo subtracting method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will detect automatically the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you connect the dark photo directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durcut: an average of the neighbour pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all the defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear interface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo formats, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also use center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise there are no sharpness effects caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure area of today's felt and color and grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation to an image that has been made without this filter. the tool vignetting corrector applies the transformation with a centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of luminance attenuation at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or randomly to a luminous intensity of 2, reduce the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminosity, Contrast, and Gamma Settings: editing an image with the Vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more subtle adjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the color gradation; image processing from the colour gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction applied to one image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect, but flaws at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grader corrects the remote corners to the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally, this value controls the strength of distortion of second degree. with negative values, barrel-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion of the fourth digits. this value works more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners' has the reverse character of the General parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value recompiles the image size and creates a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The spherical or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. best perform this correction as the first. if you retrim a picture and then perform a ton-shaped correction, the effect would be obvious to falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line. move it to an important location, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the barrel / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu Transform cropping from image processing or through the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs, such as pictures from the front, frame and paintings, is to adjust the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the spherical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org website which is achievable under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 IR video, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters of film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option of foaming film granulation if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller changes the amount of film granulation and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos, as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digicam; Filter film granulation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granulation on your pictures. this is known by classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of films the manufacturers mix large silver baskets of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film granulation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular view specially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The regulator can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, to ISO 2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grading effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicam; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicam; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting.</seg>
<seg id="601">The upper elects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better for large images. smooth checks the smoothness or, from the other side viewed, the magnificence.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the machining is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoother 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digicam; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbohydrate. the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicam; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digicam; Filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works very well with pictures with a simple structure, where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, mondaring landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art by means of distortion. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art by means of blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom sharpness: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a focal point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurred the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train taking photos, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blurring: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in the light tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred the image by random shifting of pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: find the colour basins in the picture and blurred them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses an algorithm protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digicam; image processing to hold an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter rain drops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the drop drop filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can move it by mirroring or turning it into the correct orientation. the tools for this can be found in the Transformers "menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bubbles are definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you zoom into a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can the missing information be recovered or guessed? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job here. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The size change tool uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality then try to blow up the tool.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many picture editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintaining the aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the original image aspect ratio will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and Load are used exactly for this purpose. each insertion for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">It can take a long time and load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of a photo by magnifying a small color image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation but also a frequently underestimated tool to assemble a picture. to cut a photo you have to create with the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle when you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The Ctrl button for image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool According to the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait format or landscape format. in portrait format the larger value of the height and the cross-format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool According to aspect ratio, uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeter, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max. relationship button to set the area to crop up to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after aspect ratio saves his settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values in dependency on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflects the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the co-operation help enable you to show help in order to better assemble your images. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third element, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and you have been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden divide at all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquid auxiliary lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to third-rate rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow on this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to guide the eye into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also diverge from the golden spiral mentioned above. its vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that unlike the harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonals can be plagued on these lines a static object can be more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the color button you can set the color of the guide lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it easily happens that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the digicam; image processing and the tool to repair free rotation. select to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair this is to use the function transform cutting out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatic Cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after the rotation. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is lubricated a little. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the image with transforming trimming from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move part of the picture in one direction and move the other part to the opposite. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help you will see a vertical and a horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point such as the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have finished the shearing, the image becomes blurred. for a single lubrication, this effect is mostly negligible, but two alloys produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing, the picture has unsightly triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming trimming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system at this point. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF underneath.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; only shows files in formats that you know. this happens by means of the file extension and a comparison of it with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, the file will be edited. you can change this list of file extensions that & digikam; you can change this list of file extensions. in the Configuration section you will find more information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to even select the format to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG in the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also store lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read very helpful guidances in English under Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam. in the Configuration section you will find further information about the use of modules with & digikam.</seg>

<seg id="716">In the Palette Editor, you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders to files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed in the palette view as a line. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">The color is described below the palette view. here, the color name can also be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used for selecting. to create such a selection, click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box is activated by clicking the Color button, the color is inserted from the color table by the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwrites another; depending on whether the mode was selected overwriting. this mode allows you to set this mode by selecting the check box under Beim Cursor.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy, Cut and Insert.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in the clipboard: for each color three values for the portions of red, green and blue and an optional color name, followed by a line end character, if another color follows.</seg>
<seg id="723">The colors in the palette and the output of color selections can be dragged with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="724">Choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selector on the left.</seg>
<seg id="725">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graph.die & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraph viewer; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graph.die & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraph viewer; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; an. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Posters; and & konqueror; (so that a change of graphene in & posters; recomputes the graph and is in & kgraph viewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphene in & posters; to open or to open the graphene in & kgraph viewer; in a & posters; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from about 1000 knot and one hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kgraph viewer; is a & kde; -program that presupposes the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for displaying the graphs. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own sub-window. in the beginning, if you start & kgraph viewer, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar only contains the icon file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right at pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by the factor 10. below you see the maximum comminution of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">When the file has been modified by another program, the following window will appear:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraph viewer; may also remember your decision, so that later will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings kgraph viewer; set up... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graph file outside a running & kgraph viewer; instance open, eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you will have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraph viewer; instance, or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub-window of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but you can also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all the graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice as well as change it later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph is to be split into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use several pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be adjusted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled in by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without header and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The refresh shop page gives you the option of setting the behavior when a file has been changed on the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or the program can ask for each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the ability of & kgraph viewer to specify when a graph is opened outside a current session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that every time it is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives you the ability to set the start behavior of & kgraph viewer; you can set a default behavior (opening or not opening the files of the last session or not) or determine to be prompted for each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, usually with one click in the main window with the & RMBn, opens up additional possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among various & graphiviz; -layout algorithms. the entries found on the & graphviz website are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directional graph. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of directed graphs. the algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for ungerized graphs. it produces depictions according to the springboard model. in doing so, the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a spring-spring model for ungerized graphs. it uses the Fruchtman Reingold Heuristics, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphene.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes in a circular manner according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which will then be executed by a shell. the command should be able to accept the graph file as parameters, and give the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can & eg; the & graphviz; -Algorithms specify special options, or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graphene (judged or executed) and applies the default algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directed, & neato; for ungerized graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be displayed if this is necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Displays the What is the mouse pointer. with this pointer, click on a & GUI; element to get further help to this element (if available).</seg>
<seg id="758">A list of changes is available at this address and in the file ChangeLog in the base folder of the source repository.</seg>
<seg id="759">& kgraph viewer; is a & kde; program that uses the & graphviz; tools to display. it requires the following program packages:</seg>
<seg id="760">A special setup is not necessary to use & kgraph viewer; you will find more options in the Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="761">The main window of the icon editor is divided into five areas: the main toolbar, the bar for drawing tools, the status bar, the .Colour palette and the grid, in which you draw the icon.</seg>
<seg id="762">Creates a new icon. if the current file has been modified, you'll be asked if you want to save the changes. then a dialog appears in which you can choose whether the icon should be created from a template, or if you want to start anew from scratch.</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module images are available to read new pictures and save them.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner by the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to do this you need to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the Menu Add Images, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select here the source from which you want to get the image. you can also set the default source for next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by using the default ducrhe default values to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the scanning button to see the image. in the Kooka manual, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed, as some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the button, you need to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the options of the target image appears. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and therefore creates very large files. you also need to select the folder and # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after you have selected Importioned &gt; screen shot in the menu. a window appears where you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select The complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workstation. if you have selected the complete desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot is to wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other work areas, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot was made, the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to show photos to people that are important to you. you can display your favorite photos of the world, place the photos of your camera online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module Export to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be led by the process of generating a token. this will be used for your authentication so it is virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started to enable you to log in at Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr Website. the following page will be presented after a successful application.</seg>
<seg id="800">Just close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module export to Flickr is started two times, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which shows the current access permissions that the module displays. currently, the module does not support other authorizations. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add images should be pressed once after you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. clicking the Ok button will start uploading the photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the picture as keywords during loading.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Public, Friends and Famillie you can set the permissions on your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you change the option to change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value recorded at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your collection to a gallery server.</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module gallery export has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI mailing list at kde-imaging @ kde.org. warning: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic location allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, latitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlator. this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above dialog appears then. to load a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file with a GPX file.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data will be merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a place for pictures you can manually edit the GPX file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The interpolation options and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have the right data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place. since the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set using the displayed map. select the region and zoom sie.Add this repeatedly until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be manually selected. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to attach GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a gallery of HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four tab in which the settings can be adjusted. you only need to select these albums. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below will see the Albenvorschau and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider's appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option For each picture a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow,</seg>
<seg id="825">The Reiter Album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permissions. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLImport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG format, the EXIF information of your original images is also stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth, which, of course, also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The preview pictures allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thumbnails, these are small images displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the programs to determine if errors occurred during production. the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or shifting. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, an image is displayed by default in fullscreen mode. this can be changed into a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases, as no compression of color information takes place. this can be found e.g. in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera-client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI mailing list at kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module Metadata Editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image. the data will be copied after you pressed the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write to any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please refer to exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG encoder can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages of MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can insert a basic image transfer. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD formats for your DVD player. to burn the medium, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow. after that, you can start using Extras MPEG Enaschau to start the module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should let them black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the mpeg-output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, then it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all the settings to your wishes, you can start using the code encoding the generation of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or calmly enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indicator appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages using the Settings button at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images saved in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quotation from Him is: do not expect from dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to process your images frequently or later on, you should not choose the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch conversion mode allows you to convert various images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick Package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the image smaller or enlarge. to do this, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-press: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be seen before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images selected by you. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the list of images to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the Images button, the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the OK button. here you just have to add the addresses and the subject.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't mind sending too many images at once. most email accounts have restrictions on the size of emails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments on the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you to JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG image file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original Exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages in search of errors. however, your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Diashau module, a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL option in the presentation activates very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option shows that the filename of the images is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a final loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly select to show that the pictures are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. the best distance, however, depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can select. randomly, each transition between the pictures selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI Module time & date is currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI mailing list at kde-imaging @ kde.org. warning: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your images and videos with annotations, you can browse through this, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, entries are now available in each group, i.e. persons, places and group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have added your images and videos with annotations. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the browser view changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images shown on which both people can be seen. by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images on a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the persons, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can use & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can store your own thumbnail, which is of course also valid for locations, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images by name, select the button that is located on the right side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do so, you will need to open a category editor, as shown in the picture. here you can adjust the image for the respective person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and by selecting which part of the image should be displayed or truncated.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the search entry in the main window, a dialog is displayed that is very similar to the dialog for displaying the image properties. you can view this dialog on the image again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the caption or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you like, you can also enter a date to be searched for; the date can be either a part of the total file, e.g. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can browse all pictures according to specific names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, however not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try out the same features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo, in case you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. then some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this line shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of that date will be displayed in preview) and the timeline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time information. if you select an area, you will only see images of this period in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual is described the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can call through the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether you want to create a & kphotoalbum; export file to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information you want to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed, which is obviously obvious to the viewer. for example, that all images are of a party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why they are not addressed specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. as a result, those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 does not download any images, such as a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you set. so he can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transfer time. if he wants to get an image larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, set the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">It is best to select a base folder for all of your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you have to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder is stored and automatically added to the next time. this allows you to select a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After creating your images, you can check if these are really all visible for viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will start. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that are just described have all three based on basic folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have already spent a lot of time to record the pictures, people on pictures, recording location, etc., you have to do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can share all the images and share this file so independently. however, the obvious drawback is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either import a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images found in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files will only be possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can call through the Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">At the option Manual in the vicinity of the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option to copy the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option on this page is Maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size because the .kim file is otherwise very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the Import menu File... select, become & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The importing assistant consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category Persons of the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the importing file are to be imported and what categories they are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; if you are looking for example pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the different steps of (1) Setting information about your images, through (2) searching and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures. however, it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remembers the folder in which your images are stored and will use it automatically on future starts. if you want to read another folder with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; use the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... enter a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, the various settings options are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can invoke by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups, such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up full member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; splits its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can call via the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications together, it may be that the modules have been tested with & kphotoalbum; therefore you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them to your own pictures. demo database can be called either via the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, so it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not working. this is the downside when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications arrange their images in albums: this is an album just a folder. even though & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order for albums for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">The current album, which is simply the current view, is simulated, so all the images that show you the preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, you have to create a list of albums, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so if you, for example, use the category Persons, you will get & kphotoalbum; so do, if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are compatible with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do this, start the Settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture, you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start and photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you can see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar you can see the window that you have entered your image database. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the picture to show you an overview with all the available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to annotate each image with annotations. this includes information about the people shown on the picture, etc. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example, on all images Jesper is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text field by setting people, places, and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to relocate the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people are shown, you can, by the fact that the names used are shifted upward, to find and assign the persons faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting after date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and add these images with annotations. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture to the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, then it may be more convenient to select all these images and use the menu item several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture, you will see a browser window displaying the USA as an overview. to show you that it is an oversize group, a special icon will appear.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it there in order to make it an sub-category of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move and move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the boxes that form the upper edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window out of a frame by dragging it outside the pane area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are happy with the settings, click the Options button... which offers you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide windows. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the image in the browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or all pictures in case you have no filter. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will appear in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the preview. just select the images you want to delete and either select the Delete key or select Edit menu in the Edit menu. now, you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use images without having you saved on your hard drive. of course you have to store the images somewhere, so that you can record it in the database index. in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all the necessary images can be downloaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard drive. however, this can be seen in the images 1-9. however, the thumbnails are present for the images 5-9, so you can preview these images. however, you can't view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this feature requires you to copy files from folders and copy them back into it. so far, it doesn't support you to ask for inserting the respective CD. so if you want to avoid the mess of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the pictures menu you will find a sub-menu with the name of privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those you want to make for others and click on current view lock in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also use all the pictures that your little sister can see, and choose the menu entry Anything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images are to be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry to lock images, causing all the images you have locked. if you want to get the pictures displayed again, click on Lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the Privacy Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard drive and on the other hand, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them at some point. for this reason, it has a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in the picture. it shows, of course, the picture, but additional all the information you have entered through the picture, e.g. who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else. you can also configure what information is displayed and whether any information is to be displayed. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see the matching entries to this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them and back by using the button image up and down. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and End. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus. start and stop the slide show by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch it to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can drag and zoom into the image. to zoom in, you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. the plus button zooms in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the Sync button, the zoom sets the zoom, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that they are in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotating functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can comment on the current image using the menu item Remarks from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image. at the moment you can view the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and see them as good or bad as you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features while viewing them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can make a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in this you see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set characteristics on your images, you can see them in the browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, then you can simply use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you want to show categories in dre preview, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will allow you to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way, you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to view the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; turn on the painting from the context menu. to finish the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler, you need to use the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wiremodel views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, as all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu Insert.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will pop up to enable you to choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can delete selected objects from the scene, either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse context menu.</seg>

<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render only a part of the texture (e.g. texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), you cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the checkpoints disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the parent object or as an absolute value. objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their Visibility Level is smaller or equal to the Visibility stage chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window arrangement, or if you need another arrangement, you can set them arbitrarily. you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below an existing view, drag the anchor to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the link to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the whole height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the anchor in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flashcards at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement is floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from the anchoring, drag the anchor on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the chambering bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you can find entries for any type of view. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with View Windows order... save it. it will display a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program needs to be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering icon icon in the toolbar or select the menu item view scene render.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many rendering modes, from a quick preview to fullscreen shots of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar, or select Render Modi in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to have a name that lets you know the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the subsection subsection and enter the image section to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can select properties, which & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection light. a detailed description of the rendering properties can be found in the User Manual of & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just one beam each pixel, different errors can arise. these images often have a Moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and details are sometimes not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the display. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of this error. generally, pictures with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn anti-aliasing, calculates and binds & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive, because the super-sampling comes with the adjacent pixel. the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively, because each pixel is split up again and again, because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray uses a beam of pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are pursued separately and checked for further divisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, changed & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha-channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the Import menu item... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command set of & Povray;. when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; want to import, write this source text between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can draw objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds to the source code of the object in the open text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; render a scene. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User documentation for the displayed object. set the path to your retention and version here. versions 3.1g and 3.5 are supported.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example, height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type label.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object start of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid seperately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values give a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects like the ball, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high level of detail for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this feature creates a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross a wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern made of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you cross the floor, a bottom is rendered under the objects. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern made of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the Window Pane section, explains how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector standard window arrangement: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The existing window classifications list shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window ordering is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, you create a new column on the right of the existing window, with Unten anchor the window under the existing window, with flashcards you will receive a map view together with the previous view and floating anchoring the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more exact knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere at one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you will get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't want to insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodore; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will have to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu item, so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is subject to later instructions, but note that the camera is in the view control points that you can change the camera's target point. just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you apply the Apply button or enter the input button, the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings. as a result, you will see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could, for example insert a Quader (insert Endal Body Quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or enter the enter button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also displays the level, albeit at the moment only as a finite level. if you render the scene, the plane will expand to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree carefully, you will find that you can fold the item for the bottom by clicking on the + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will find only the standard options for each new object: scale, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to practice a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens, in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor pigment), with a click on the button Preview, how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigments preview only shows a matt black material, because you have to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the header and the bullet in the preview, just click the Apply button and then enter the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this even more frequently, but the board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose the color in the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should be able to perform simply because you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeller; already understood. the ball can be created just as easily as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the button), so the ball would float above the ground as you moved the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering is now a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface looks like a matt black material. in the next step, set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the bottom, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First subobject and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click on sphere Pigment, then select one-color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler offers. hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a rendering method to produce a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical beams from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that render the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effects. so the scene pixels are processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you see the scene. without a light source you see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default File dialog, you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest item in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you haven't got saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the recently reverted command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Store the current window order and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add new commands to & kpovmodeler using this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. you can use this option to add and remove toolbars for & kpovmodeler; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to make rough surfaces, without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis, using an image file as color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">Using & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking on the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all pictures should always use the same window.</seg>

Select.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You can set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as & Amarok; short commands. this makes your keyboard to & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, most of which can also be found in other KDE programs. this section is comprised of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlists, and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function break could be & zb; this will look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; additionally Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use a dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require'Korundum's Rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.' 'dialog --sorry' # {error} 'exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and manage Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; each KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is usually used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose, scripts are written to the default input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events even if there is no use.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Feed the script to display the setup dialog. to store and store the setup data, each script must take care of it. if a script is started, Amarok will set the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is being played. the script could now ask for more information on the new piece with DCOP functions (e.g. metadata or unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signalizes a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu entry has been clicked. to remove a user-defined entry, it is possible to use dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle). to remove an entry you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; termination, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to complete, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal tar archives (.tar), which can optionally be compressed with bzip2 (.tar.bz2) so that the user can clearly see the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the generalization of amarokscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining loadable modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can add it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. perhaps you just search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collections browser and quick search, you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Perhaps you already have some playlists, but can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if the decision still falls, select the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right thing to rediscover your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Since & Amarok; autoconf and automake is used, you shouldn't have any trouble when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options to enable or disable the configure script using the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compile options, certain dependencies must be satisfied so that they can be used. details can be found in the system requirements section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help in the development of & Amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up without any effort on the setup dialog. the setup dialog has several flashcards for setting the different functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">In addition, if the option is off, only the playlist window will be displayed (JuC).</seg>

<seg id="1214">External browser: lets you choose which browser of & Amarok should be started when a browser is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Other browsers use: you can specify the path to another browser, which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save playlists when you exit, save the current playlist automatically when you exit & Amarok;. enable this option if you don't want to lose the running playlist when you exit.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep up-to-date piece of play visible, that the playlist window will pop up / unroll in order to keep the running piece in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing the context browser, the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can adjust & Amarok; s appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok. by selecting Own fonts, the otherwise gray section will be enabled. you can select fonts for the following pane: playlist windows, player windows and context browser. click Select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the choice of custom colour scheme, you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme. to do so, use the color selection selected among them for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Playback on the start causes & Amarok; after program start playback automatically continues with the piece at the point where it has been stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The On-Screen Display window will allow you to switch on the OSD. if you are using on-screen display, a preview of the OSD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Use your own colors gives you the opportunity to customize the OSD colors for font and background. a click on the color surfaces will open the dialog for color selection. if you don't use colors selected, the preset & kde colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below is a list of available space holders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is designed for Xinama users. this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi-monitor environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down selector. some drivers still activate further settings in this map.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, which & Amarok; to browse for music files. to include a folder in the collection, mark the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes to set the folder to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the crossed and their subfolders are searched for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok; add all found playlists to your collection (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlists browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collections database is used to select a database for the collection. the drop down selector driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup is necessary in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; under calculator: if the host is located on which the MySql database is located. then, under port: the network port is entered, under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Username: and password: to enter the data required for connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The flash.fm card is the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and thus update the profile: this setting enables you & Amarok; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">To retrieve similar interpreters: after activating this setting & Amarok; a list of similar interpreters can be accessed from the played piece. note: you don't need a load .fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok just needs the kdelibs package and no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs so installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to make kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager holds the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will make trouble. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, therefore we use kdelibs and Qt because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by following ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the TagLib developers under bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and make the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Usually this is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the TagLib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a little more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then turn off automatically when inactive for... in the setting of the sound system, or at least use no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by email (the e-mail automatically opens when a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta information, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "$ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = get _ v2tag; print" Error when writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\ "unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s symbols in the status bar (RandomMode / Replication / Dynamic playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a well-known bug in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the icon effects are easily forgotten. note that in some cases up to three times you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarkapp: icon lookup error: binary: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then please check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd'which amarkoapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any colliding Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok finds the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most installation problems are solved most easily by means of an expert, your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please bear in mind if there is something to fix a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only appears a blank playlist. how do music pieces come into there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files into the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitive, the Start subwindow was converted into the statistic window. you will find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the rating column must be displayed in the playlist. click the title bar of the playlist and select column view. click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for a piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove and then press the file on your keyboard. or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select Von playlist removed from the drop-down menu.</seg>

<seg id="1272">When you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device needs to provide a blender. a blender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (Software blender).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the problem cause and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify another sink (e.g. ossink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you only want to listen to a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you're looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. exactly like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can print directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. enable sound servers to run with highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper suid is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x, there are problems with KDEMultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed play. read this error report. to enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you do not use the Arts driver but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster Arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts Driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been strongly optimized for Analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffers in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but when I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes & Amarok; AB. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you need to register all the components. follow the command register to register all the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask the IRC Channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (quit Amarok before!): - download ffmpeg, compile and install it. then perform all ffmpeg files once as a system administrator and once as your normal user. then delete all ffmpeg files in the GStreamer module folder.</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; presupposes the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. in addition, some additional packages are listed which make work with & Amarok; more enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player, also has & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions. additionally, the playlists window contains multiple browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok; used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a runtime display showing the currently running piece or current stream. just below it is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current play. a click on this area changes the ad of the already expired play time to the remaining time of play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the runtime display. you can switch by the available analyzer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press on your keyboard and the current analyzer will appear in an independent, magnifying window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons also feature the PL and EQ buttons. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlists window, while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume. with the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and change to the next or last piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The built-in Equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classics to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Playlist of & Amarok; is the most developed playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the abundance of features deter you, they're all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be split into two main areas, on the left hand side of the navigation pane. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser shows various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpreter. these three subwindows will later be replaced in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you already used earlier versions of & Amarok; you may notice that the sub-window has dropped off. the information presented there are now distributed in other parts of & Amarok; in addition, the information can be viewed in the statistics window (extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the performer and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window shows information about the piece. in the title there is the name of the piece, interpreter and the album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to hit the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also show cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended items. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter. this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current performer.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to be displayed in the music subwindow. to do so, right-click anywhere in the sub-window and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last area, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. when you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the text subwindow, the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages with the help of self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the internet. if there is no text script running, you can choose which to be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouping only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - first the pieces are arranged according to the performer and below it will be a further division after the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Different performers.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - Album - Sorted to Interpret and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabetically and are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them according to performer.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can adjust and combine the grouping according to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection as soon as you change something to the selected folders. if you have many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly below the toolbar there is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes for using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a drop-down selector which allows you to filter the last added pieces to your collection. you can also select different time windows, ranging from the last 24 hours up to one year. in addition, you can also select your total collection, which makes the filter practically disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This is the current playlist, adding the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry, you will achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Setting pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">As a playlist... Save the selected pieces as playlists. you are asked for a name under which the list should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transferring to the media player. see the Media Player browser section for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - This means that the selected pieces are burned to K3b and burned either as data or as audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) move files into the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the selected album as a compilation - marking the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears among various performers.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Picking up a selection tag - Changes the album selected as a compilation back into a normal album. after that the album will no longer be displayed under various interpreters but again under the accompanying performer.</seg>
<seg id="1379">Playlists are easy to use with many playlists, including Intelligent Playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The bottom part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created intelligent playlists are possible. click the Intelligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist. there, you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player sub-window is used for the connection of & Amarok; with your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter. when finished, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. when the transfer is finished, finish & Amarok; and solve the drive binding for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Among the toolbars there is a search field that allows you to search for a file. the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL. if you type: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz and press enter key, you can access music in the file musi.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">When the playlist is longer than in the window, the appending of files can be difficult by simply dropping. in this case, the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically include dropped files at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired location. once you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed, which contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you type separated search terms by whitespace, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then wrap the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will be searched for entries that Mike Oldfield contain, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">For example: rating: &gt; 50. This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -somewhat searches for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 comment: bad. this searches for all the pieces that either include Mike Oldfield, or a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bad.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order to the entries. the entries will then be labeled with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button to add to the playlist. to the right, you can save playlists, empty playlists, and Random Mats.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow the undo and restore, so you can revert or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, magnifying analyzer. the refresh rate can be adjusted by clicking the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as the one you see in the player window over the right mouse button. above this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many other buttons available for the toolbar, for example playback controls and volume control. you can set up the buttons displayed by clicking on the menu and set up toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about playlists. it displays the title of the current play, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for chance mode and retrieval is displayed by clicking double in the respective display area with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the Status Bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist. on this menu you can reach the settings of & Amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1476">When this is enabled, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of the window and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is enabled, their contents will be displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks and blocks of the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, provided that a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The headline is a narrower area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box for modifying the key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the keyboard assignment to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be performed. almost all functions of & k3b; should work straight away. this dialog is intended for personalization and for fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with one & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality may be controlled by a shell script for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functionality, so it is more your taste and the type of your task in addition to which the included programs will give you preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP; you must make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; -program in common, support & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatDVD, and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () void copyCd () void BurnCdImage (KURL url) void BurnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project get by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name) void addurls (KURL url, QString parent) void renameItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString NewName) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">Thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folders:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT apps Url / home / trump / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -read for & kde;. with it can easily be saved audio CD; s can be read out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are also possible, depending on encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; files in WAV files on disk) and of many encoders encodes these wav files (these encoder packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution). other encoders may be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in wav files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per caption) compress into the mp3 or OGG format or also in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders have to be installed. however, all of these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions, but only the encoder packages must be installed which are needed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format is to be used? the chapter Welcher codes gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compressing factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read the audio data from the & CD; it is not possible to bypass any copy protection. in any case, & kaudiocreator, it is not possible to bypass the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup has to be done only once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling for reading a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; retrieve information from the freedb from the Internet or work completely without a network, where everything is manually recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the page, step by step, you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start the CDDB request of the CD-data according to the installation of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be made.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup guide - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of encoders available so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the default. note that previously the encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already used file will be selected for encoding rather than a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of alerts (such as protocols, piepsen) for program events (such as read the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (such as Encoder, for setting up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is required. besides FLAC there are others such as' shorten 'or' monkey ', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and barely available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by compressed data compression according to their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but the differences are less important because both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is still provided with most distributions for free, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (with high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG abouts is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a song. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good pleasure for music by young people, portable devices and auto stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you want to have absolutely the highest quality regardless of the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information obtained manually or automatically fetched through the program from freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD title to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator need to be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button designation in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of entering into the computer. it is important to note that only text is spoken here: & CD; Title, Artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of translation: this means the author) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from being done by the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be added harm.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb may not be used with another (fake) address than the specified in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears that the e-mail address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has verified the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; when using freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is needed. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from CD and WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; those who want to know more precisely, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package from the right distribution must be installed first if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at first opening there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodiver.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, writing and reading real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, ogogc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this won't work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give you tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and use our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine, as it is considered as not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you have write permissions on it (eg by trying to copy something into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setup of & kaudiocreator;, something probably just done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what every read & CD needs to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and what structure is used. since we are lazy, we share the program to download the freedb to download the data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it at any time of reading a & CD; change if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program, so it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, then a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the available entries of the device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General settings. here, there is not much to do here. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is as left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information please select, so that you will be informed if information is missing to create keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop-down selector is simpler, a & CD will be found. this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or file name is changed with Konqueror &gt; renaming and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to enter everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb is not used. however, you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two selections need to be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for calling the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server nearby. on this way the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, since however many firewalls log the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to send any & CD; send data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously discharging pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know it, so just try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard reading the last piece: check this to check the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / or the path / folder can be specified in which the WAV files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Just enter it as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the '--id3v1-only' entry for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' Tagger for & kde; in case of later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous encoding WAV files: with a dual-core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be attempted to encode more than one wav file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each read of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music cleverly, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard drive. we will create and set up MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, was described in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is structured, because we are comfortable and the & CD; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each read-out & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet available in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data fetched for a & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; manually input data instead of retrieving it from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try the & CD; this example can be found. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, the & CD must now be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a brief moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, look for the Questions and Answers section for help or go back to the previous section on basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all tracks are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; a window is displayed, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you haven't selected the check box for the automatic request of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - input the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the sample on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the 'Current title' field, unless you have a collection with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments inidividually per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor (e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album, and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment section. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; this option is set on the encoding settings tab; take a look at the section 'Basic Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the release CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After selecting 'OK' you get back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you typed all titledata of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you download the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles which are marked so are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece into or off. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If the selection process has been selected by clicking on the Selection button, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will have a look at the window with the orders and follow what is running.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the Rider Orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will see you when you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example. did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occured immediately after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, read and code parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. in case of low-performance machines, the result is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message will be displayed for a short time in the upper left of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; is maintained today within the & kde; CVS as part of the kdemultimedia package. however, most distributions contain already a pre-compiled package, da & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & kde; package is. install the package kdemultimedia from your distribution. if you read this, you have probably already done it already...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at persons compiled from source files, and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many different options. it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu has been clicked after the first start of the program, without any clue how to proceed from this somehow empty screen (especially when there is no audio CD; in the drive), or from unusually short menu?</seg>

<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator. whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it. and if you read this, he has left that section and therefore agrees with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you have managed to get the source file from & kde; SVN, then you don't need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke game from & kde; beside others, it also has some features with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts, which do not have other & UNIX; -MIDI players.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is needed for GUS cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so that you can drag in & drop; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically calculates the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">When you finish playing a song, kmid will start again next time with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the play button in the toolbar, select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you pull it to the & kmid; window. (for several pieces, they are added to a collection and then played one after another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; a piece plays, you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and using the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo ad and thus change the speed of playing. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar, like a pressure on the button pause, or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu piece, interrupts the playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use lyrics, others use lyrics and other both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which a song is used, so that you don't have to manually set the entry automatic text selection, but you still have the possibility to change it if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">In case you want to specify an event type, select the entries text events or property events from the Settings menu. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you combine. these are played in series. in this section stands how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. these can be found in the collection menu at the point Organize. click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then giving the name for the new collection. this collection will be included in the beginning of the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the threads in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. remember that when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song to the Add button. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection then will be added to the still opened items.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu sequence of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button previous piece, the previous piece from the menu item or press the key arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events are translated into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map which converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and thus always lets trumpet sound when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all the required replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the keymap"... END Define Keymap "Another keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so I can in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section shows how the patches of General MIDI are displayed on your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is needed to put all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (GM-Patch 127), you can hear a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun shot. to do this, please use the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch, where every note is a different percussionary instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and instrument. you just need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map the percussions on the percussions-channel. take a look at the provided key maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to change the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on Channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be used with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which relationship pitch Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file there are no decimal commas).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM gives us a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch Bender event with the value 4096, to play a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two sounds up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. this can be found in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboard you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the View Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find e.g. a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't compel anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid, compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's homepage)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, support & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Before, activate automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to recover the standard tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; desktop a & konqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a karaoke file) or go (if I want to play a karaoke file), only in the & konqueror; window change and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly, without adding them to a collection, turn the automatic Add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatic adding to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to continue to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; wurde von & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; aus Maacute; laga (Spain). I study mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make a lot of joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will count among friends of & kmid; but before you send me a MIDI file, you should contact me as I may have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; written completely in my spare time and won't get any money from anyone. I would like to stress that I am only programming further because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AWE cards.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Thank you also Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Peter Gritsch, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheim, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error notification or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you have to compile & kmid, with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not hear music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by MPlayer or Phonon, as well as for playback of DVD's, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>

<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website to new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is only displayed when information is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played out after each other, you should use the category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchical level. if you click on an entry, your group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback will start with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can change that only when you click on a name of a category, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category, then select it from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, select the Playlist from the Edit menu and select either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the edit mode is left or another group is selected without having to balance the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some features can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying in the end animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of start animation can be the display of a favorite shot: & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smilgt; & quot; / smilgt; & quot; / smilgt; & quot; / smilgt; & quot; / smilgt; & quot; / mum.gif; & lt; / smilgt; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is one tab for configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer. everything must be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example like a 'flash' played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even paste the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To play the & KMPlayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer must be used as service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To always take a given backend for a specific mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual modification of the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before watching TV, the device and TV channels need to be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog box is to be used under - &gt; Quely- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected, of which one is selected. the code to be used must be found out (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of SMB can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). therefore, the video forlinux extension needs to be supported only on the first screen (: 0.0). therefore, the XFree86 server must include the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, Splayers use different names for sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, dvdnavsource, dvdsource, source, source, source, source, source and vdr.exe are source. when enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there hints how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be done as user root by connecting the device. it is absolutely certain to make sure that / dev / cdrom shows on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts up slowly, why does my CPU have to be checked for their performance every time?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overhauled. kxineplayer automatically needs the last saved value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1755">Encoding: this will set the character encoding. it should use the character encoding of the system. modern systems use UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of the & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for & latex; for the integration they have to be selected only in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (complying with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about this. it is a short description of the functions and more detailed information are given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; provides - as well as other source code editors - highlighting the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). if you see gray areas of a green text on the screen, it is very likely that any mathematical environment has not been closed. however, it will hear it through the modest appearance of the output file nonetheless. however, it will save you through the highlighting time and hassle.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic adjustment of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & Kile; automatically an empty line (for input of the text) and the associated line for closing the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be disabled in the Settings menu... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be viewed and viewed by a single click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful when creating your own & latex; as soon as a DVI file is created, bouncing & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the actual output type of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, convert and to print DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the RÃ ¼ ck search, the elements of the DVI file are connected to the editor and once on an element in the DVI. file was clicked, the corresponding section is jumped in the & latex; source code is clicked to the corresponding place in DVI.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick-build: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is plugged into the plugged, plugged, and there is no call of & eyepiece; after the fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the toolbar, the three large selection fields should be conspicuous. the selection fields were developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first drop-down field is for the rapid integration of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The versible & latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Additional panel Further is for inclusion of items such as keywords, footnotes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a term for a section, an image or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (selection above a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list is displayed with literary inclusions. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can be written naturally also in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down selector with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¼ e is used for determining the font base. it can be used to define the font properties for the main text, the base notes, etc. the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document may be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses according to the\\ documentclass command contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] defines the font. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also happen later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the Mendeletion or buttoner quick build.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; for storing it automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document is compiling, it should be searched for errors when logging in. if using quick-build, & Okular should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (engl. environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the text editor 12 is created and only a few areas should have a different font. the command\\ begins {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will then allow the creation of the font files within the surrounding environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only supervised within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities for assigning the readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold print, italics, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italics print and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a set can be displayed recursively with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; markup language has been shown, then follows a step-by-step instructions for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments would be made for the better readability of the document. to do this, mind. a quote, a few places in bold and italics print and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor-view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file is created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try it out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI is an independent file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI file, the same steps as for creating the document are needed (see). at the seventh step - after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed by file printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI file to other formats. once the DVI file is created from the & latex; source code, the conversion can begin in other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; binaries. to do this just set Modern under Settings Kile... Tools Build to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to drill the forward search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and then clicked onto the default search. the jump to the corresponding place in DVI; the viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & ocepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document by & Kile; open and jumped to the corresponding line. for this, & Kile; in & Okular; defined as text editor (Setup eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using quick-assembly of the & DVI file; the viewer cannot open, an error can be present. if there is an error, this will be summarized in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file lists the source of errors in the source code. in the editor you can use the button Previous LaTeX Error and NÃ ¤str LaTeX errors for jumps between errors. to view the erroneous line, you have to click on the error in the log and & Kile; jumps to the erroneous line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the respective button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the preset options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be rewritten or used by the wizard for the rapid creation of a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Most users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting File template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a file New, some strings may be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in Settings box... settings can be set in General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document is created in this way, the following steps have to be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files. if a simple way to create a template is deleted, it should be searched for one on the Internet and can be found in the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & Placards; as an internal editor. & Placards; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about it and its possibilities, the manual to Kate should be used. users of & Kile; can start reading the chapter work with the Editor of & Posters; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called via LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands, which can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; word. this means that when you click on\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse different kinds of source code and to highlight it. for example, the & latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants may include additional jumping marks. this is an own type of bookmarks inside the text. the MenÃ ¤ge Edit jumping brands or the appropriate key-keys enable the jump to the next or last jump mark. this is also highlighted by this jump stamp, so that it is automatically deleted when entering a sign.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile; although & Posters; already outstanding offers have been added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; contains always many environments and groups and therefore supports & Kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Includes a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this option also has an extended meaning as this command is also called & latex; commands with a RÃ ¼ r-slash (\\) and an additional star (*) end in the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & Placards; provides the keystroke Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description to edit selecting paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for further commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command is used to jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to check the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or inside the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering a lot of nested environment commands, the overview can quickly be lost. this command completes the recently opened environment so that the nested ambient structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are specified by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that match those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command is used to jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the welded bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command is used to jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the buckle closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the shovel of a & tex; -group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many nested groups braces can quickly be lost. this command completes the last opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple suits are used as a device. for the useful implementation is used in & Kile; the sign "is used for two simple instructions." & Kile; knows this case and adds two closing notes for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic import of the double quotes can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX will be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used in specific settings (e.g. ngerman or French) and therewith German or French suits. there are also many more languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When shifting the shift key, enter a smart newline. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break but at the same time the\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment close & box; the current line with\\\\ with a close line breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support preset & latex; - or user-defined environments.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thereby arrange all Et characters (amp;) among themselves. when using Shift; Alt; amp; searches & Kile; after the next tab in the underlying line. even though this tabulator may not be the necessary, add & drop; some spaces for the columns position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Posters; already providing a good source of source code, it has been added in & Kile; for specific commands (mostly for & latex;). three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic completion. all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings Kile... fully-adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the\\ begin {environment} command & box; automatically add the\\ end {environment} command to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the button, the last character of the input is removed and it is possible to grind the complete list. on the other hand, the list can also be resized by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command. alternatively, jump marks can be inserted, so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by editing jumping brand NÃ ¤tlest jumping brand and then the desired parameters can then be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Set up Kile; set up... Kile; you can make adjustments to these lists. there can be different wish lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as books of the general language used can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not useful for the execution of environments. it must always have a few letters with\\ begin to result. on the other hand, environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for the completion of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When invoking the default mode above the menu editing environment or the key Alt + Shift key Space, the command is automatically merged to open the environment and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the environment can be continued in the simplest way and ended by pressing the key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile; detects that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is merged.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; set up... Kile; you can make adjustments to these lists. this mode uses the list of default modes for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports custom lists of abridets that can be replaced immediately by changing strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... boxes can be set up. for example, the file example.cwl, in which for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is inserted over the menu editing or the key Ctrl + Alt space bar, the character L will be replaced by the\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Great WÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ cher are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been noted that many buyers are written more than once in a document. this provides & Kile; the completion for all the already written watchers.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Settings dialog box... Kile can be switched off. here you can also set the threshold for the display of the completion.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / of the local home folder. mode stands for abbreviation (abridging), Dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The dialog rendered graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics to the graphics formats, the sections should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well-known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages. if the PDF output is used, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To be able to examine the result of the work, you need to compile the source code. all construction tools are summarized in groups in the Creating, Creating, and Generating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer such as & eyepiece; or the further transformation can be used the key-key Alt; 2. after that, the DVI file can be viewed in the standard viewer using Alt; 3, by means of old; 4 the DVI; file is converted into a PS file and by means of old; 5 the PS file is viewed.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the quick-build command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no built-in viewer is used, a new window will pop up each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is being funded by the MenÃ ¼ project Neues Projekt.... This provides the following information for the project:</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, which & quantaplus; ladet, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. thus, the plugin system is very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality instantly and don't have to wait until someone builds the faked in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a KPart, we will begin using the Edit menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog enables you to manage all contained plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a storage location & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders as well as subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the attitude of one's own identity are important with regard to news and comments. see for further information on remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something happens. see in for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be drawing the opening and closing of the project so that later can be seen how much someone is working on it or sending a message when a file is backed up as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page event configuration of the Shift; F7 project Project Properties Dialoges can create, edit and delete events.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An EMail is sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the address can be a team or subproject manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To enter notes is simple. either the comment entry from the Editor context menu can be selected or the @ annotation keyword will be entered in a comment section followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a certain member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (Role), with the nickname of the team member's nickname, role plays a role in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are independent of upper or lower case, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& Quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be setup by setting Quanta. this dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; with respect to tags including car completion can be changed with this. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal bulk / lowercase means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal / lowercase means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if approached, tags for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Automatically close not optional tags: as above for all other tags except the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and end-tag automatically update: if enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic creation of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accentuated characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detection of different types of files. the default settings can be restored using the Standard button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files (where the encoding of the file can be passed). however, this setting here is ejected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting here is ejected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates periodic backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program, the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in your own view (or the documentation in a cardboard show), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, which represents the illustration of the parser node in the document, can be set in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structural tree, the following action is possible to change the action solved by clicking on the Structured Tree by clicking on the Structured Tree.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be automatically opened. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area to set the abbreviations (a type of templates) that is unfolding during editing. abbreviations are in groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ifclause means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here, the plugins can be managed. plugins are part-applications of third party, which can be re-used by any part-capable application, best known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plug-in if it is not located on a standard location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "component in" "" "Only-Lese" "" "mode load: check if the plugin refuses to load. only-Lese-KParts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then testet & quantaplus. select whether the entered information is correct, even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & Quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently, only one plugin is available, support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. using the Options button next to the Debugger plug-in dialog box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & Quantaplus; -UI:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all items are listed, with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action is used to connect to debugger if necessary, or it tells the plug-in to listen to debug requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that in the normal case you do not have to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session Starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server for a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it happens before a debug is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger carries out the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger carries out the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include it is corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Assign the debugger to skip the instruction and go to the next as if there is not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you can help you get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & Quantaplus. they allow & Quantaplus. they allow & Quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes out & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; s & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the Tag folder and the toolbars. Tag folders are handy, symbolic pastes of image buttons (above the editing window), which insert text and instructions faster in a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the owner dialog, the & quantaplus. file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; self. toolbars allow quick inserting of tags into a document without a risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag Folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better view and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but the only element type above itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for class class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (family 1 only)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Set a text into the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only happen once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of attribute. additionally, it contains additional tags that describe how to display this attribute & etc; This is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & Quantaplus; used to reach source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & Quantaplus is used to reach the source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a method name and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, meaning the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouping the elements of a list. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Defines the position of the attribute text within a dialog. this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All tagXML files need to start with an & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but watch & lt; note. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, and lt; text &gt; replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog is up in & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. dialog will appear, its simple instructions will follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, the check is only done when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this tagXML file should be schema.de.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, one & PHP; overload function is described. the file name of this TagXML file is to be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! Doctype tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" returnType = "class _ name" type = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tags &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD editing DTD settings. this allows diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should create a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = turnaround 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name will be used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set up with Settings... created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The button shortcut assigned to this action. clicking the user defined button can be assigned a key shortcut; with Keiner the current key shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited), which can change the document or use as input (or parts of the document), can be started. examples from & Quantaplus; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various Lo in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $KDEDIR / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text will be attaches unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods described above, a script can input from & Quantaplus; to the default input. in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the standard input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be rerouted. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages are directed to the default output. it can be specified what is to be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the input field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in any given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it, enable "Edit Tag" if available so that entering the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly icon. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other Programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; default 32x32 pixel by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit Size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the symbol created does not only help you to remember what action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In view of the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually seen as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user be signaled that clicking on this symbol will be startled; -tag will be inserted in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this happens through the menu with Settings actions specify... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want some common & quantaplus; add functions to the toolbar or it should be splitted into several groups for a better overview.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I would like to select the separator (top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the Trenner supports grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all the symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After new XML does not exist, it will be created implanted, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the proper folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar (s) is loaded (will) when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most noteworthy extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & Quantaplus; -Repository, if someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = function1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... language Reference = Basic syntax,... basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # prior to Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and logically at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but watch & lt; Note. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; scripts the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements separated by screed (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily store your file docrc according to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (like you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & Quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the waste resources (DTEP packets, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else who will be sent. in different places there is an email send menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archives, from where all the others & Quantaplus can download them. the contributions are checked and only made available when our team uses them as correct and useful for the publication. to make a lasting contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. this ensures the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for their private gpg key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the dialog New resource you have to fill in the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and start clicking OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, inquires & quantaplus. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly, a message appears to indicate the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by & Quantaplus. however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in tagXML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype DefinitionScript: the string that appears in! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, brings & Quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & Quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and to get full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter attempts to bring these concepts nearer to them, without their understanding and quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & Quantaplus, the workspace is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus. it stores everything that is globally selected, in the common folder structure of & Quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool tracks, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a certain project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the flashcards with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document set entries, such as closing the current, other or all boxes, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editing pane will lead to a further context menu with regard to the processed document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the tag under the mouse pointer, help to the word under the mouse pointer or open the file if the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently & quantaplus works; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus works, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; then click the icon representing the tag. now you can enter the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction manviews (QIT;) enable information to be navigated to & Quantaplus. to navigate, open it and strip them. in the presentation with map managers available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation building views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool called & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be done using the contextual menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, an entire website & etc. all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of the integration in Global, Local and Project works also here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right click of an element opens a list of commands regarding navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, manageable attributes and namespaces can change. the application-based application system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentary for & quantaplus, from Quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add, edit and view project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & Quantaplus has; two flashcards at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This flashcard shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This flashcard shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts, which are executed, give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & Quantaplus works are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the Chocolate side of the toolbars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & Quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can backup and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of & quantaplus; -files on your system. for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in the PATH in front of you bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& Quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & Quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & Quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what would be if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for that the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be recorded that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of Why developers, what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only this all possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus. to extend as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& Quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI). this can dramatically increase productivity. by using self-deleted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can be increased dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More details about the documentation are with help: / Quanta (either typing this URL in & konqueror; type, or helpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and served by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it, and the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check in the section on Templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error will be reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts the special characters to & HTML when inserting from the clipboard, so that they are correctly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; spelling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches on or off the block selector. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script will issue error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">The problem reporter is activated when the problem reporter is switched on as soon as one changes to the structural tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column to the left of the main window. this column allows you to set Bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -Projects are saved using the .webprj file extension.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows e.g. to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus, manage the project. in chapter and quantaplus, you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are kept in project / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or Project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. it just creates the name. actions need to be added by setting actions... These toolbars are saved by toolbars, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables the loading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">This only works with (X) HTML DTDs. smart insertion means that & quantaplus works; inserting by means of toolbars is denied if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available heredichtschemata depends on the posters; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line tag identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms for developing. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between different types of user interface. due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries, the switching time may sometimes require time or incomplete graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode that corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open sub-window. selecting a entry will enable the appropriate subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus, main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of posters; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbars or add which ones can add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled up from top to bottom, because, for example, after completing the project name, the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be set later using Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering the name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus "project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.g..de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol are used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default Toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have a static web content you want to download and change. in case of server-side scripts (e.g., PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let go if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started anew, not hanger.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to goodies.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clinging out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard will contain three settings that simplify your work. in the menu with project project properties, these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree in the sub-window or with the Shift key; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders possible), which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignor will be excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This can be used to select the desired debugger. currently, only Gubed will support you. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the sub-window profiles, high-load profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by pointing out its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration window, event actions can be switched on and these actions can be added, changed or deleted. event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs, such as the backup of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened. you can't influence this behavior at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus works, the project file is automatically saved. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files find. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behaves as well, but the entries are missing opening and opening with... in the context menu called with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows you to remove the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will be blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgot at programming. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is needed and the rather unsecure password on the disk does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & Quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created to upload the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety threshold, this is either a time-saving feature or a danger. use them after your measurement. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just one set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in one project, that is, by simply swapping the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the project toolbar project or project toolbar, accessible by the toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & Quantaplus, with which you have the most to do. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows you to adapt & source Saul to your own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbars in & Quantaplus; best stackable via the Tools menu bar. use and Add are different. adding tool bar is handled in the section Add to Toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and the symbols on this can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, and other actions such as toolbars can be removed, toolbars rename or toolbars can be executed, which can be indicated in the dialog, which actions on these or other toolbars should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code cutlets and files for linking. & Quantaplus; use templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & Quantaplus; in about the restrictions you present for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & Quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually inserted in documents by means of links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be written by any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, more specialized documents are created in appropriate subfolders. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document should be included again and again in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment over a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base. some examples are available in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure according to exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook, etc;.) and choose File As template Save As Local template Save As...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. check in the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged with drag and drop on the tree-view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: just copy the file into a template folder. it can use all file management functions for it, such as dragging and dropping or pasting over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files tree view, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can also be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates provide a very target-oriented approach. you can pre-print headlines and footers or dynamically link with & PHP; create, insert or link files with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow template is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A drop-down selector with the three previously described types; files, text or templates.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set in such a way, it would deactivate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project, allowing to copy content templates to a folder with special headers / footers to provide a whole presentation already with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing the right mouse button) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& Quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source text editor, which are accessible from the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second splits the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to the source code editor if necessary, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document that contains & PHP; a small green icon displays the Vohandabsence of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit, it is still necessary to edit the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one, except that at the same time the changes both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor are visible and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is active, this mode is already active, enabling the active cursor from one window to another, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via Settings Quanta.... After choosing VPL; you can select between synchronization after one click or automatically. basically, the recommendation: a small span for fast computers and a large range for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this is used to reduce the manual encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. one click into the list allows the change of the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of shaping the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is possible just as with the meta elements. editing of CSS rules is currently not supported yet.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to embed an external CSS stylist by pressing the File Open button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is like in a word processor, by moving with the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strangely. text can be inserted by typing and deleting using the key or distance key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way on the toolbars, as in the source text editor. it is important to note that inserting tags in previously existing identical tags is not removed e.g. if an anchor tag, surrounded by text, must be removed each other surrounding anchors day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the tables assistant or the Listen-Assistent are disabled. they will work later in the & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists of toolbars must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool to examine style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be pursued.</seg>

<seg id="2230">Xsldbg returns the full path from a file name without pathname. file names in the same folder as the top loaded style file filename with relative path to the working folder con xsldbg If for example a stylist file. / en / xsldoc.xsl is loaded, the following input is possible:</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no reference to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, any number of other useful functions were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, just copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the merge editor among the differences windows enables resolving conflicts and simultaneously displays the resulting result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files while merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you merge and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; indicates the exact differences and resist the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you have to check code frequently, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more anger when somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other one differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both differ in files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make your typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Subfolder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 3 -o Destination Folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog enables manual typing of file names, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. open dialog will remember your selection and shows it next time. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">On the folder folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders is started. if for A a file is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then used & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active and can be edited. however, it is not strictly necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can also complete this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start merging / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare an entire file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how much these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you need to create two corresponding files, upload them in & kdiff3; and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and inserting text into another program as cut-out and paste (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The Info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Every Info line has a different color. (if the path is too long, let the mouse stand over the line for a while. then a small helpwindow will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed through the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflict in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) good to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences have been found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (with C / C + +, for example, white characters are relevant only in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line breaks is activated, the line is represented on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an Info line with the wording output:, the file name and [gealed] if you have edited the result. usually it contains already text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is deactivated!!! (use the Springe buttons to find the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative figures are used, each difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the merging column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row is selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merging, or by manual editing, there is no more line left in the group; this is only a placeholder for the case that you change your mind and maybe yet again select another source. this text will not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marking you might copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merging conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. carefully proceed with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources ignore the options numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating is mainly used with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side on, side beginning, end, Ctrl beginning and Ctrl end, see how you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the output window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. using the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in the merge operation and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Strg-picture downward) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark to the clipboard, you must copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl Insert). it also prints the option selection automatically. if this option is enabled, you will automatically copy the Copy button to the clipboard and manually copy the manual copy. be careful with this option because you could thus overwrite the contents of the clipboard accidentally.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line endings are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line-feed character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line end of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved upon completion and restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog will also provide fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in italic font. if the selected font does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered vibrated. on these systems the button Preferences automatically introduces an unjust colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, any selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard then drops.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used choice on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">The second step compares each line. in this step, white characters are not ignored. in this step, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a cart track\\ r 'and a line feed'\ 'at the end of one line, while others only save a line feed'\ '. usually, when this option is checked, auto-return signs may look identical, but how a white character is treated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white signs are used as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflict in numbers or comments, if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter to scan folders and perform merge tracking. see documentation for the comparison and merge documentation for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version is attached to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. modifying this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to quit and restart, and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally through the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the top setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">On the selection fields for coding a short notice appears, which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding is individually adjustable for each file, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to set the output of output commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress changes in white characters in the text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color-coded oversight column. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will be displayed next to the normal still a second overview column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd rather like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just fade out the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison window next to each other or overlapping. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files. a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as preset names for the output file. (if this feature is used to restart the merge again, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first committed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that matches exactly your requirements. you can use this feature for example to cut off annoying parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first hand over to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), the output of the command is used only at the line distance. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program this by themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command line for newlines to transform the input into uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1.\\ U converts the found text into capital letters.</seg>

<seg id="2354">While you're experimenting with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line distance appropriate. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, i.e. virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several substitutions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of used you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / regexp / replacement / SCHALTER 'However perl needs some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal pre-processor will be retained for displaying and merging. other operations only change the data that the newline looks like algorythm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge whole folders recursively with & kdiff3.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adapt the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without really performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder has been specified, & kdiff3; Folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed about a small message window about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files that were compared to that point will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is finished, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left hand side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and every folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure will normally be folded up. you can fold a folder by double-clicking on the + / -, or by double-clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open or unfold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the A / B / C columns and the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the collision event cannot be chosen automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type once again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above picture, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their entire contents are identical. then also folders have the same color. in folders the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirtiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. when A is a folder and B a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. when a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronizing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified, and if the option directories are synchronized. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but are not identical: merge and store the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B; copy & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge (unsure), then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and performs the newer file for copying. if the files are different but the date is identical, the date is identical. if such errors are not removed, merging the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, one file is processed after the other. it indicates the status column when merging was successful, and corresponding other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is OK.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis, KDiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unsolved, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or Odd), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the contractions actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then in the Three-Folder-Merge-Mode, C will be used as the target, and B will be selected as the target and / or B will be used as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries in the destination folder should also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all the entries, select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (key shortcut). to only merge the current item, select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears indicating the defective items. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all the entries, a dialog box appears with the options Performing, Simulation and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without the real changes made. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is needed (merge a single file), a merging window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select again directory merge / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3; its work continues with the next record.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; stumble on an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually merged, note & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) will not merge together again. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The & kdiff3 settings menu (Set Preferences - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern will be displayed in the element tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many auto-matically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be set in folder specific with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignor.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a hidden attribute. in other filesystems a previous score indicates a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is disabled, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible recursions. a link to a folder containing a link to itself would result in a loop and & kdiff3;) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of solved, unsolved, non-white and white conflicts.) Full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage costs you a certain level of security. please use caution.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality of the change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal to size. this can be useful e.g. when copying the change date is lost. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enable synchronization mode if two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical. the results of merging files are also stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is suggested as action instead of merging. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also applies to normal merging of individual files, not just the merging of entire folders.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder-merge view stays visible while merging single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can switch the option directory & text window to switch off main windows in the Windows menu and switch between the two views using change between directory and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. however, in the directory menu you can also directly merge a single file without first having to run the folder. to do this, use the current file merging from the merge menu. as soon as you save the result, the status will be reset and the file will not merge again when you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status, however, is lost when you re-read the directory: directory menu: new read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively und. or.. contained. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blank &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modifying date. therefore, the permissions or the change date deviate from the original. (note the option of confidentiality of the size.) (This is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is at present as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part view from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a KPart, & kdiff3; indicates that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then captures & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. then start & kdiff3; the program patch will start to recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In konqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - KDef3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; being executed as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">There are already tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is compact). furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge together like the diff3 program from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for quite a while and have learned a lot by watching in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and probably don't have the correct prefix to KDE. in default configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (eg kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will first be treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. iF similar lines, next to each other, this is is but this pis more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes each difference in the files where it starts and where it finishes. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create a separate file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit large amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">If text is removed suddenly; no src is left; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; use many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and miss the purpose. please use a different editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDE on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of last changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake is used, you should not have any problems with compile it. however, if difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) into the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-paste) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replace the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to re-read the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries displaying differences. this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder doesn't already contain these files, they are missing after the merge. (the behavior is likely to be discontinued in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the button A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, clicking the button will be removed accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, stop them or move them. this works both inside a desktop and with several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual work areas as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button you can move windows within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu only has the two entries Pager. when clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, on desktop and exit. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and can also be moved to other work areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & Kpager, the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field allows the & Kpager; view the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is enabled along with name, the names are provided with folder numbers, & eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is enabled, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only empty working areas are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; -main window can be determined: classically let & Kpager; in a 2xN Raster appear, as known from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontally, all virtual desktops appear in a horizontal row, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents. in addition, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click inside & Kpager; and then set up selections of switch... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vid. if you do not have a write permissions for the file, you must register as user root or turn to your system administrator. in this file you must enter the key windowTransparentMode and assign a value to it. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager; part of the package kdebase is, you need a working installation of the KDE key packages.</seg>

<seg id="2483">In the default setting, & Kmag; the area around the mouse cursor as a mobile magnifier. alternatively, you can set a selected screen area in the magnifying window (drop-down mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the setting mouse cursor. please note that & Kmag; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard node; / Qt; mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop-down mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the content of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift key or use the & Mb; you can move the drop-down window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the drop-down window. note that the upper left corner of the drop-down window remains solid and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save into a file, paste into the clipboard (to insert it into other applications later), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the update of the ad. stopping the update causes the CPU time to be set against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a drop-down window will be displayed. the selected area will be displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& Kmag; automatically uses your set short commands to save files, open a new window, print, reload (with the button document reload in & konqueror;), enlarge and decrease & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">Kmag is also known as & kmagnifier; it is a screen lupe. you can use an area of the screen so as if you would like to use a magnifier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designers or visually impaired.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulate a mouseclick as soon as the mouse pointer persists for a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people suffering from RSI syndrome (Repetitive Strain-Injury Syndrome) and which every mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouseclick as soon as the mouse-cursor leaves for a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people who suffer from the petitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain. moreover, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, due to the mere desire of the mouse, pain may also be caused. suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer, if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it even clearer: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you stop the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The smart move activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after it emulated the pressing of the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the release of the mouse button is executed. in this way, you can drag the drag by pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This dwell time must be blocked after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If the intellect is switched on, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is activated. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button wait, before releasing the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this function is activated, a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. these movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ stroller; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can & kde; to do this, go to the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, choose sound system and here the General tab. there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">When this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at each start of & kde; started. this function is currently only available under & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the user button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last move of users.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use it & kmousetool; first with default settings. in particular, the smart move should be turned off at first. if you have become accustomed to the automatic mouse click, you can later assume the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in the case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral parts of windows or places in the browser window that does not show a link will not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually fairly simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to take out the mouse ball. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear quickly when you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you need to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can easily scrape the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use smart offset in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you have a mouse click on it. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keystroke. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent shifting, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Intelligent shifting is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very likely to mark the text, copy it to the clipboard, or to execute any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. however, it will probably only once cause problems. here are some advice about this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use smart move if you just start using the mousetool; instead, select a mouse click on an end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will be used every time, when & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. later, you can use the intelligent link even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the Xtest extension for & X windows; this should be the case on most systems already.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activates the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer persists. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI's syndrome, causing pain to be pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a dragging process to start, before releasing the mouse button. in this way, dragging and dragging with the mouse can also be performed.</seg>

<seg id="2532">On the first page of the wizard (left screen shot), enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text. you will find more details in the description of the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2533">On the second page, select the standard text passbook. from the text passages you can often select used text passages without having to type them. the text passages can of course be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screen shot) you determine the dictionary for the word extension. & kmouth; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words. in addition, you can compare the word lists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary, so that only correctly spelled words are included in the word extension.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is clearly arranged and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sets (the lower white field in the screen shot) and an inline memory of the already spoken sentences (the upper white field in the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2536">If you have Kmouth; correctly set up, you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field. each spoken sentence is attached to the drive memory. you can select from it sets which are to be spoken again.</seg>
<seg id="2537">With the menu entry settings kmouth; set up... open the settings dialog from & kmouth;. this dialog contains two flashcards, voice output and settings, the side of the word extension as well as the page KTTSD language service.</seg>
<seg id="2538">In the input field of the box map, enter the command to call the language generator. in the drop-down box below the input field, specify the character encoding, with the text passed to the language generator.</seg>
<seg id="2539">& kmouth; knows two ways to pass the text. select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator.</seg>
<seg id="2540">If the check box is not selected, the text will be passed as parameters. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>

<seg id="2544">With the choice of instant message, the selected text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the memory storage. by selecting Add to the input field, the selected text passage is first entered into the input field.</seg>
<seg id="2545">With the second drop-down of the editing window for text passages, you can determine if the text match book is to be saved automatically when closing the editing window.</seg>
<seg id="2546">The book stores the book with the selection of text passages. if you choose to discard changes, the text match book will not be saved. select Before Choosing, will be saved & kmouth; ask if the text match is to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="2547">The Worteritory Page contains a list of dictionaries for the word extension. in the main window next to the input field shows & kmouth; a drop-down selector, if this list contains more than one dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2548">With the buttons to the right of the page, you can delete or add dictionaries, change the order of the books or export them to a file. below the list, you can set the language for the dictionary on the input field and in the drop-down box.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Select the language you want for this source; & kmouth; then read the & kde; documentation. the frequency of individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence. in addition, you can compare the word list with an OpenOffice.org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2550">With this option you can merge the available dictionaries. & kmouth; then ask which dictionaries are merged, and how they are to be weighted.</seg>
<seg id="2551">With this option you create a new, empty dictionary with no entries. da & kmouth; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary, create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two. in the upper part, the text passages are displayed as tree structure.</seg>
<seg id="2553">In the lower part you can edit a selected entry. if you have selected a text passage, you can change the text passage or the shortcut shortcut. if you have selected a text match, you can only change its name.</seg>
<seg id="2554">You can either add actions like new text passages or books, or delete selected text passages and books, either through the selection in the menu bar, in the toolbar or via a drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="2555">The order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dragging the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the & Alt; button.</seg>

<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the retained commissions will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Alerts have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News is the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; read a long text on a web page, you can welcome someone who just enters the room. & kde; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest is simple text assignments. every order you use from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts, which do not have any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such read, this issue is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String placers replace parts of a text by other text. you can specify the parts to be replaced, either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be delivered with predefined string translator filters that enable the creation of Chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for formatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>

<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktts; first, make sure speech-Dispatcher works correctly with your voice synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell script SPD-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; the program kttmsgr should be developed so that the setup of speech emulators is directly possible and the script SPD-conf is no longer needed.</seg>

<seg id="2688">These sliding controls allow you to adjust volume, speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controls and display this gray, the voice selected by you will not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. when you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that the first set is synthesized more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not set up a speaker (or forget to click Apply). see.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this map you can set up specific actions that are executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktts; handles four types of voice orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. once the output of the screen reader has been read, the retained commissions will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Alerts have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning holds the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News is the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you & eg; just read a long text on a web page, you can start with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">A text application is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, adds & ktts; the audio output to the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card card only apply to normal text orders. for messages, warnings and the output of screen reactors there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktts; read Knotfy messages, start kttsmgr and click alerts. the map card will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Select this check box to enable the reading of & kde; notifications. if this setting is not selected, the remaining settings are disabled and ktts; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, notifications where a sound is played are deleted by & ktts; not read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. if you click the Add button, a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message, the & conversation; sent when someone is mentioned in an IRC message your nickname.</seg>

<seg id="2717">If you have selected custom text, enter the desired text. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter the properties of the desired speaker here. default select the speaker, which is displayed in the list on the list of speakers as top entry. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels of events. if an action is specified for a particular application, it will be executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application.</seg>
<seg id="2720">The event All notifications for the application default (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. for this, you can set the pre-read alerts as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to save the settings for notifications in a file. use the load button to load saved settings from a file. the loaded events will be merged with events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click Delete. all entries except all notifications are deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard includes trademarks for voice control, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSML only partially and only in the basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (british male) since this is the default voice, the festival used in the issue of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100s;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! Doctype speak PUBLIC / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN.</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set border recognition filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into individual sentences. this can start & ktts, as only the first set must be synthesized, not the whole text order. thus, you can also skip or stop orders by way of the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set border recognition filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set-rate recognition filter is automatically set up. you can change its settings or add further set limits recognition filters, beginners will get discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn the setup of the speaker selection by exiting. switch off the list of speakers and specify text to read. switch on the list of speakers, change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed. of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or cancel text orders on the card card, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set border recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limits recognition filter compare text with a regular expression for Statutes and insert a tab character (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tab character is automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set limit recognition filter retains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knot), warnings, messages or the output of screen reactors.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set limit detection filter, you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the flashcard reader selection you can override the speakers settings for the application. the card card is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the uppermost on the card-card speaker). in other words, no speaker properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the properties of a furnished speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & ktts; otherwise select & ktts; the speaker, which corresponds best to the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select here the properties of the desired speaker. if this property does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property will have priority over other properties. you can also set several markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language lies ahead if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To delete all the properties in the speaker area that is closest to the following, click on the default speaker switch and then use the speaker that is closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text assignment in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number is 0 required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I have compiled debug support, but I do not get backtracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crash and ktts; it was finished. probably you have to register GStreamer. GStreamer 0.8.x is the command-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, it may be a non compatible version of GStreamer installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music at the same time. if I hold a text application, freezes & ktts; ein. on the & Console; appears a message stating: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem on your system that conflicts occur with ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. you can find clues for possible solutions on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it at festival, but kttsmgr shows this voice not.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / vocals. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice, to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In order to do this, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesided modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the map for speaker systems. depending on the chosen voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speaking speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite bold, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML resformerfilter, and set up the speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read websites with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the Tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so it does not produce any errors, rejects the xsl file to convert SSML to Saber the GENDER tags. the same also applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a separate palette knife filter and now I can do it in & ktts; no longer prescribe or go back. on the cart track orders is displayed, the order consists only of one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (dot, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon) are not allowed to filter out. instead, use a filter for set limits recognition.</seg>

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help do so in the instructions delivered with festival. if you want to read websites, you need to install the (male UK) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">You need to compile an additional module for these voices, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you have to enter for the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. choose a Cyrillic (8-bit) coding such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding should be set to an 8-bit Cyrillic like koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA, synthesizer. then festival takes over lexical analysis and & MBROLA; generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; -program and the & MBROLA; voices can be downloaded from</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; this allows management of network interfaces, routing and DNA settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K menu controlcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter; displayed. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting a kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network Setting in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware does not install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow & knetworkconf; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed in the installation of & Linux; with installed and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be charged by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this will automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform to select from the list that matches the distribution and the Releasestand. selecting the setting non-re-enquiries can be made permanently. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will be automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. before all options are displayed gray, which means the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in system management mode, click the System Administrative Mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the complete functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the Reiter Network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The set-up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button... setup in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the option Automatically, TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system will be carried out at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at any system start, so no further setting is required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP should be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the option manually, the TCP / IP configuration can be done without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address input field, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the network mask, the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Depending on the need, network devices can be activated or switched off. switching on a switched-out network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Depending on the need, network devices can be activated or switched off. switching off an activated network device can be deactivated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the host's IP address in the local subnet that communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located has to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNA support replaces a full domain address by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer requires http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution part of the name resolution allows a simple management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be sorted by selecting a single entry and downgrading or downgrading in the list with the buttons down or downwards in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to the name resolution a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution select an entry and then click the Edit button. it will show the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list named calculator describes the hostname-to-IP address reference for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used for booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually, the list of names in particular contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add.... Add New alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add button. if the known machine has multiple aliases names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a particular known machine from the list and select Edit.... The dialog to edit hosts will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system. in order to enable the changes, the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installing binary distributions (usually rpm packages), it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installing the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it's easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; install with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended to experienced users only. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second all of & knetworkconf; alterable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about integrating the PC into a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are run with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found widespread dissemination. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. this description is currently concentrating on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address is assigned to a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact point which has a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are mostly used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.042; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed in DSL connections, so it is not surprising if there is a different content than specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape. the first one was to create a surface for tar which also provided the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective unpacking. the second aim was to answer a question my wife posed: how much longer does it take to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be included by & kdat; this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; hult the tape back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detect & kdat; the preload on the tape doesn't, you'll be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the preload, it searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smooth, the symbol for the tape drive is changed to indicate that the tape was mounted. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by unfolding the item for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be resolved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; indicates by changing the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used for storing data. if your tape drive requires that a tape is formatted before use, this must happen before you can be formatted before use. floppy disk drives usually require a formatting of the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity goes & kdat; with the format of the tape continues. all data on the tape are lost! after completing the formatting process, the tape is automatically included and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only save this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog opens settings for backup. in this dialog you can check the selected files once and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings dialog, the dialog appears backup. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on any of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog appears for checking. in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the review settings, the dialog appears to be checked. this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can redirect the restore, the files to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and choose Recover....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog appears for recovery. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the recovery settings, the dialog will appear again. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the band index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can re-create the index on two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, only those files that are located on the same file system, such as the folder. folders lying on other filesystems, can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is viewed from tar independently from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to ascertain the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & gt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the tape is involved, the command is loaded to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; block the ejection of the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, when releasing the integration of & kdat; automatically discarded the tape. do not use this option at floppy spreaders.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must tell & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only cover one memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that the band has been formatted since the time.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work unless they are incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is involved.</seg>

<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystem log; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a log file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries & ksystem log; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will open to you, and it opens instead of that a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not started with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log folder, for which normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or string. the list of the log rows will now be changed automatically, so that only log-lines will be displayed that match the selected filter. then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, also select another entry. the string of the filter search concept will then only be matched with the entries in the correspondingly selected column. for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the column process, and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so show you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. minutes lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color than protocol lines of the level indicator. the colored display of minutes lines can be switched off in the direction dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain processes (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable to skip to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new incoming protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystem log; allows to display multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more recent information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystem log; you will also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystem log; im & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system quickly develops into the standard for the control of the program starts when driving the system in & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without installing a new installation and reformatting. the & Linux kernel looks first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you must ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you can find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service that you want to start at the boot of the system or when switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also use a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. be very careful if you have confused something, then you get it repaired by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does all the correct scripts start? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one has a K, the script will be invoked with the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script will be invoked with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server running level that lets you run only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; in addition, I could also have a user running level, that & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. this will only happen if you remove an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new level, you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to recover entries that have been thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator button to activate the different work areas (available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another Runlevel, move it to clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired running level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sort number or name of an entry manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, it will be saved by & ksysv; changes to preferences are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard running leveln, and now the machine is constantly rebounding. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services provided with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE, or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but is unfortunately not standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check that all configuration files are present (and whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply end with no message if their configuration files are not present or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that it can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter customization of & kuser; read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you've made any changes, you must save them. either you use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the entry Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog for user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings. only if you have limited space constraints (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can customize individual settings. additional flashcards appear, if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd, as installed in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password management will appear, if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd, as installed in BSD UNIX.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if space restriction (quota) is activated and initialized for at least one installed filesystem (see the file quota user / quota group on the filesystem). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the limited space restrictions in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each filesystem. the current file system is selected using the array file system with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card card groups inform about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group belonging to the user can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group's dialog properties include a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group, or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and modify the boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add the default operating system, remove, add, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
