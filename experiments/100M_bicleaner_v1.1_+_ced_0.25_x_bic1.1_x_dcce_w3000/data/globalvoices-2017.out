although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and practi@@ sed his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered a mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was like the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA has only strengthened .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had a very warm love letter written about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , as it says so beautifully .
he tells exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can pre @-@ election was the highest number ever reached by a candidate nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t tune up Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I got to know during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that takes people from all over the world , a deeply dev@@ out person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mps couldn &apos;t agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while playing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still adapts to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me to get used to the complexity of American life with a lot of patience and grace .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp knew his way to nomin@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception to the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , presi@@ ded over a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks at those who look different than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ B ) : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white against all the other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big Van Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; has exactly killed what America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ man , whose history , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
but with the election Donald Tru@@ mps , there is a huge part of the White America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say .
all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would someone not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank God Mr. Tru@@ mp , this is not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land for which his son had fallen sent him a message .
this is Tru@@ mps Land now , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of Fli@@ ck@@ r user O@@ EA @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca share with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played at both places has changed not only the life of the children but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the tr@@ ash
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a big garbage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among the tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest to the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs .
but after a coinci@@ dental meeting with a French pilot , this changed a musical project and the youth offered such a rare ray of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and playing with gl@@ it@@ tering eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ ia , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ manufactured instruments made up of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all made out of the rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage The kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays instruments made of recycled material and which calls itself The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic MÃ¼ll@@ land@@ fill ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , it was known then that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liberia , before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ns , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing licence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of the pl@@ under@@ ing of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stop Il@@ legal fishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister back from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legally Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing had been ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the sn@@ ail stamp , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen in real time , tra@@ ck@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open seas via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships fishing in prohibited areas . there are also suspi@@ cious driving routes - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly also whether they have a criminal code .
countries that are against illegal fishing can refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose every year because of the illegal fishing that inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies , so the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world .
their practices include sailing under false flag , bog@@ us license papers , ph@@ anta@@ sies , fishing protected species and fishing in conservation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; You may not run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now the closed front is working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed forged lic@@ ences in Tanzania . ships discovered that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland thus helps build a system that combines different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i is to help to find criminal @-@ acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine protection organization : a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of each tra@@ ck@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who &apos;s doing - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project where a global system allows the pursuit of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that had previously f@@ ished without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats have purchased more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow gri@@ ds on board , whose use was forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear every year due to illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
six countries joined forces there in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . . &quot; security is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only was the ship travelling without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets which are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 is a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working across the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; conqu@@ ering the country &quot;
the movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the government rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into the void by gathering in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the retreat of Venezuela ) both images of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is continually worsen@@ ing , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the im@@ pe@@ achment of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the reluct@@ ance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ founder of Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ari@@ zes the context of the government decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment for many is considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the election alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Demo@@ cr@@ Ã¡@@ tica , or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces , the demonstr@@ ators were to join a mass rally on the 27th of October , as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , on 3 November , should continue the blocking of the referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment .
the call was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3 , all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

on Twitter , images circul@@ ate about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
especially large waves hit the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the government according to their own statement from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safe again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic shows the round that covers the amount of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for an office building procedure , which has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the street .

others evaluate these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which , from their point of view , has taken little action against the devastating economic crisis and is rather busy making critical voices silent :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or buying .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of CÃ³rdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now spoke against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , investig@@ ates crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I thought that was ok .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made friends with one of the ERP .
pass just that they don &apos;t have to kidn@@ ap you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me that I would become en@@ vy .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the military base I had to destroy documents belonging to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the prisoners are tortured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in the year 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks where cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I se@@ wed in , and saw a couch that men were tortured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looked like a cot and metal springs .
later I found out that they fast@@ ened the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had been captiv@@ ated there .
she rarely attached a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and drove him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I immediately recognized the smell again and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible for a man to do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing eye band@@ ages .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people cau@@ tioned quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father observed that I looked to the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you gu@@ ck , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit , and were put to death by soldiers .
I know that because my father told about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed a man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to information from survivors , the civil servant Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , charges the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the path you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ hum@@ ani@@ zation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; Battle of the Battle &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
back then at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military esc@@ ort that is taken away by an enemy that was fought .

but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is no war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the head of the security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who st@@ ole cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you &apos;re not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and cried out :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anybody else !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
as I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator for this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now that I am older , I feel regre@@ ts .
I have children . once you have children , you can recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you executed people during the dictatorship . but why do the corp@@ ses disappear ?
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
one could have put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why do their corp@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not have families that could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that man can do .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to remove the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were gr@@ asp@@ ed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something always remains .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I don &apos;t have anything against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of indicating my father was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him alle@@ gations about all the atro@@ cities I had to witness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they supposedly defended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me about this ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I paid the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I was prejudi@@ ced . I ended up speaking against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 still before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 cases of severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a child under 10 years of age .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 victims were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases and sentenced to nine cases of imprisonment between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gement : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian employees .
Pi@@ ero De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations that have worked for years on justice for victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the search took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located in order to establish a memorial site , which is now managed by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto where you can extend your driving license .
the photo was circul@@ ated in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre , in which one can pro@@ long its driver &apos;s license , have witnessed a particularly mis@@ used translation during the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield the Japanese word was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ dos@@ sha ) , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrong@@ ly - but perhaps also with malicious h@@ ind and # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a inhabit@@ ant of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which appears in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that nobody has read the translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the er@@ ron@@ eous English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction of our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online intelligence service J @-@ C@@ ast News addressed a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers that are implic@@ ated in accidents across the country , however , is quite a matter of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
thus their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors increased during the same period .
the re@@ porter in particular brought comments to the light published in the Yahoo version of the article , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to like against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation error was received , among other things , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So fla@@ wed is the translation not really , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the site En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and to transfer active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers should be .
so a French native speaker should translate for example from English into French - not from French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ any employees with English as their mother tongue , who could translate translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ finding or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have a foreign workforce can still produce translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to be a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with lus@@ cious results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic sets produced by machine translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . however , by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , we can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations .
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
home page of the Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d portal ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broad@@ caster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by opposition groups who opposed the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was overl@@ apped , and advised the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . back then , the Commission threatened to punish them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission looked at this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two liters of le@@ mon@@ ade .
later , the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests specific domains are rep@@ utable .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server will reply er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously or refuse to request such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was dis@@ continued on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was put into custody .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes it increasingly difficult for the Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ k@@ tas , who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices with kindly permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , deca@@ ying schools &quot; ) edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as a cri@@ p@@ son for the family . in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money passes her age @-@ old son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange the child gets food , training and a roof above the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children need to do house@@ work for countless days , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised .
this practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for several years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke to Cri@@ adi@@ tas , especially young girls who were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collecting testim@@ onies , resear@@ ching and den@@ oun@@ cing .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that cri@@ mp@@ ed the cri@@ mp is generally still silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , which has their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; do something out of themselves , &quot; can be transferred to another family .
on the other hand , the family , who takes the girl with herself and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which is taking place in the sec@@ ret@@ aries of Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military member Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra came to Mar@@ Ã­n with a stick until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ p@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society responsible for the death of the girl .
they designated Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos have been widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows than children are registered , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her cri@@ p@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n might be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers ; they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work now and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in their employer &apos;s house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went back home and had time to learn .
the sooner it was finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the master &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on some evenings the house@@ keeper Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand alongside him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he kept them intellig@@ ently , but didn &apos;t talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the master had found someone to listen while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , explained them .
she was , however , fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also at school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken are bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ p@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to go home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I didn &apos;t belong to any group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share ads for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district .
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
start starting Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman , who came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the summary in the display turned out once more :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with it .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ago ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the pre@@ history of Paraguay , where the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ ani were ens@@ la@@ ved and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ) , and the system of Mens@@ Ãº ( where the workers were considered semi @-@ slaves ) , and that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery , in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
social inequality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill men@@ tions Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliamentary representatives recently voted in favour of a draft bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations on usage and benefits of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when adopted by the Parliament , users of social media must register in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the law , a place would then be set up to grant citizens a permit to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fin@@ es .
the bill , composed of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ sed in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any use that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities ought to impose the registration . it is unclear how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , a parliamentary committee and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of them it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it has not yet been known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Senior Research Calcul@@ ator &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , this means that they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a trial .
this is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mode of thinking in the parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the parliamentary committee , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y , proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence was provided for those who are found guilty of &quot; threatening public order &quot; and &quot; protest to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organisation , Nature Iraq , are working to protect the phant@@ astic Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the bigger family of le@@ op@@ ards , who argue through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they always find less prey .
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depend on a large predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video thus determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera body , Raz@@ a breaks out in sheer delight .
as a trained bi@@ ologist Raz@@ a passion@@ ately shows another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies of wild animals and the education programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

in early March 2017 , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the northeast of Japan , documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture has been a state pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring coun@@ t@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami evacu@@ ated entire coastal cities from the map .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was still experiencing a nuclear accident , and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from local point of view , which progress has been reached six years after , in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents .

housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned re@@ plac@@ ements ( at the same time , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here , 80 percent of the planned sub@@ stitutes were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
however , still , six years after the catastrophe , the evacu@@ ation of temporary shel@@ ters ( at the same time , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) , is still trying to res@@ ett@@ le in final surro@@ gates .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 are still living in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ees living after the disaster in temporary shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Newspaper as@@ cer@@ tained , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools that were affected by accident have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma has resum@@ ed only 30 percent of fishing har@@ bours .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have largely affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has largely recovered , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is still far off .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal residents find it more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to obtain an overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys amongst the local population and among the evacu@@ ees . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her feeling changed vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey showed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents found that still not enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es has been done .
how it is about those who had to evacu@@ ate the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition on the occasion of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63@@ ,000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led into durable surro@@ gates .
according to the 2017 status , 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ees still live in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ shel@@ ters are older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 .

after a while , however , one often real@@ ises that one more connects than it appears at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care station this week : last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia struck him with a stick against his head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the end of the investigation .
the pictures show the police officers , as he hits in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media campaig@@ ner by Media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs come to him shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus ab the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the costs of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has been divided several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado recalls further violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he had sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after he has been attacked by a police officer who has beaten him with a stroke .
police raid attacks
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , where there was brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers were deployed in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the deputy , Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have pla@@ gu@@ ed the street protests by focusing on another unexpected prot@@ agonist : a window of windows .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting about a broken glass window in order to make a photo of their pages illustr@@ atively .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a fire @-@ set bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window of windows than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on the confrontation course with the police . &quot;
the villages forgotten by the de @-@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of the Al@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso Act , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba closed doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after laying down the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories which still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members to have heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already with@@ stood the pla@@ gues , the case of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harvest is no longer a news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
however , the sugar price rose again over a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Agricultural inspec@@ tors &quot; published by the OECD and FAO , the UN Agricultural and Food Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on began the process of restructuring in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repeated most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come .
it was officially distributed documents , which would be distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the address and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was postpon@@ ed and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ continued factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ mounted one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work@@ space producer has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services that the plants generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run smoothly .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to disman@@ tle it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ate the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other establishments .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a perspective , many young people also left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production does not even serve the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harvest the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a rel@@ ent@@ less person , yet he for@@ gives the lies that one told him not .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes into retirement at the age of 65 , not because it lacks force , but because it is bitter .

young people of the First Nations community in Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 , workshop leaders have launched mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups Song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked together with ten C@@ ree communities in North Que@@ bec and then with the C@@ ree hip @-@ hop @-@ group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop therefore addresses the young participants in talks on topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a road in Western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
most of the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always speak the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ ki@@ i C@@ ree First Nation added , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ ath@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a stop@@ per in the dialect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the st@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to keep going my days on Earth
this is the day you will take our scre@@ am
because we have lost our way in life as youth
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go forward as well as our youth
this is how they can do what the Creator has appointed .
in the commentary section , the reader and advocate of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic courts are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic food ( at the same time ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan , you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are exhibited near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; Plas@@ tische Model of Cour@@ ts &quot; ) from any food served in this restaurant .
customers see these plastic courts and decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a lot of these small companies that produce plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic courts are so common that they do not even notice them . however , a new trend changes today into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new mobile tapes decorated with plastic courts , as shown at the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few sho@@ ot@@ ers fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of food supplies is becoming more and more complex .
in this case , a ka@@ ise @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a mobile support .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple holding your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the cell phone , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ical .
some mobile phones and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest cell phone stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
other whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic courts can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the h@@ ash@@ tag # h@@ ash@@ tag # at the top of the page .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the city of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic courts are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each bone , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with drug trafficking ) &quot; which is meant to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were in the battle between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organised crime lets us fear not only our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for instance , when businesses close , because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid lives changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father only one day , her four brothers and sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task which we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
he left the house on 13 October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a les@@ bian from Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with disease and sensation journ@@ alism for a few years now .
every day I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from experts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin will think that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wat@@ ered &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and quiet .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family with threats was pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business for month until they had not only destroyed the business but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you &apos;ve lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you .
in these aw@@ ful days I wondered if weeping would resolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day his childhood ended .
his childhood had been over two years earlier when he was just a few blocks away from his home , who saw the bloody corp@@ se of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to 8,5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just some hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to depic@@ t the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages to which he links , contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting a sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how about the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to depic@@ t trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this incorrect pairing of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant meti@@ culous coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people were killed .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous path@@ ways full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank wagon fell victim to the victim .
authorities described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby which was full of people watching the World Cup World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ ted corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned for lack of knowledge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user Mysti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident map out the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ ted bodies that are str@@ ung on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story does not come to an end .
over the years , the same photo was taken up several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters from B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astically the atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and corp@@ ses were placed in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed back to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch resident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be depicted figur@@ atively .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa check has documented regulations on Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely relate the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning message published by the United Nations describes those who were able to flee , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news page , which in 2012 claimed that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein had said that monks and politicians had participated in the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from the DR Congo to capture this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed Thr@@ one to this statement , but had not related the image from the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ sions go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inver@@ ted image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the mentioned image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private sites , social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have set out examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and associated them with the respective countries on the basis of what they were published on which page they were published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which were also linked together in some cases ) , several examples can be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use .
here are some cases which can now be completely rolled up ( on the card in orange ) :
map : news frames .
country examples of false coupl@@ ings from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers , which are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the countries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through the ink eye , are likely to show fal@@ si@@ fication examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica cited as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known if the original report contains the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
according to the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre like this one , which used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; clearly no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ beam have seen this .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even inside Nigeria , the photograph taken from the DR Congo was used as proof of the bombing of B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of impro@@ per use of the image from the DR Congo , with one hand expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to timi@@ ze the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being prosec@@ uted , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a legislative proposal on what they concluded as &quot; deliberately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings concerning Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this rec@@ tification , which has appeared exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operates and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims are killing Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often used by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; epilep@@ sy angi@@ ogen@@ esis ? &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) .
this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an was admitted to 2012 that monks and politicians had participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication , the image is still included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news page An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims it is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was subsequently circul@@ ated in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the El Pa@@ is newspaper tried to refu@@ te that there were links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ov@@ y@@ or@@ fertili@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world is asleep ) .
the image of the DR Congo , equipped with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media reporting in comparison with Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly written by a &quot; Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false .
from the message in which the picture was taken from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ in@@ Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ aa also points out , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the web craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture ultimately bears a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong issues or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life both are important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
but a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who have acci@@ dentally contributed to tr@@ ashing the water around a tragedy .
suggest this mood of mis@@ - and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and taste the actual horror of what happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the dis@@ semination of violent ima@@ gery has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
one argument is that rej@@ ecting images of a refusal to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images of readers and viewers are des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ zing and giving them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study that investig@@ ates how violent media act on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent depic@@ tions in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms in order to support the fight against &quot; fake News . &quot; they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used by the context or in a completely mis@@ use way .
however , each investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
Andy Sim@@ mons uses the CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able ) stri@@ ves to offer speech enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ des ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ born every attempt of a simple translation .
one word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find , for example , words from the VAT @-@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Pra@@ ise your parents in recognition of how they have tried to care for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after being war@@ med in the sun during the cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other ways of thought and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favourite wines here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally sets out at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya came across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to an opinion from the Sri Lanka disaster centre from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge win@@ ches .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 30@@ 4 safe places .
the rainf@@ alls left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water levels of up to 7.5 metres . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already underway .
this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa Bus stood in the floo@@ d@@ water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of the risen water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are made to transport emergency shipments to the residents locked in their flooded villages .
several organizations and start @-@ ups have also been preparing to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry foods and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call + 49 7@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the taxi @-@ call Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ y Centre will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for assistance and donations . these were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross free of charge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the united efforts of the government and civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need of security and provide aid .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I have trusted her four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the br@@ anding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next wave , we are betting on rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ scar@@ f , tied up of an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that have built up in their imagination .
they reli@@ ed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we therefore identify ourselves as a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well designed in our collective performance that as soon as Muslims , like I do not fit into it , have to be Muslim .
ab@@ domin@@ als are being ab@@ used
I am not alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western vision the religion of Rum@@ i was er@@ ased , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting accounts for a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been coloni@@ zing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should be saved .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ assembled the story behind these pictures .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them .
I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous Nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality of nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the United States did not even select their first female presidential candidate .
this narrative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabian , Muslim women to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who conduct movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deep and er@@ ron@@ eous , that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ fung@@ al attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we talk about it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the nar@@ ration of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims represent the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population is an African American .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American ste@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan re@@ thought the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ challenged Muslims and Americans .
but am I not a Muslim and American now ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes out or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs who all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I am jo@@ king , we do not carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to combat widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced in the ongoing band by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that is our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , have manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell and because of the way we talk about it , Islam hos@@ tility is in more than just a stranger who tears a veil on a woman .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but being a Muslim was only then born into my imagination when I was four years old in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim belief and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , may see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the every evening ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arabic verses for the protection of the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

approved for use .
belonging is the image of my grandmother mat@@ ernal side with her sisters , as they win a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim is to speak the prayers that she had said to me when I have a bad day .
being Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - for centuries - was coloni@@ zed by an &quot; empire , &quot; which a company has established with the name Ven@@ erable British ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
approved for use .
belonging is to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an has gri@@ eved for his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family , who was not allowed to close his arms in half a century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by coloni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslim is to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have &quot; coloni@@ zed &quot; all except four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped over a century ago by a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , ash@@ mere subj@@ ection of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mosque in England .
before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I had ever been and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion people go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy uses the US and carries the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave called Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple sclerosis , but fail to communicate to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion har@@ bours more possibilities than a cube , but is represented in the reducing doubt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; them &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons are building structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
structural Islam hos@@ tility is made up of Muslim registr@@ ations that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer , who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders towards people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly List &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we are leading and the bombs that we disc@@ ard on Muslim lands .
because of the stories that we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from Nor@@ th@@ western University participants showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faulty and dangerous prints that we are ste@@ aling in our news auctions .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this gives me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global point of time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years before , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but that made me today an un@@ disputed Muslim .
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
things that may evoke memories , for in all the inter@@ sections of our humanity , there may be a story where someone is made to &quot; another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the Bridge in Berkeley , conversations in the context of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia take place .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms which we usually throw in our schools around us or that we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are fought and people have been enth@@ r@@ alled by the work of the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , four decades ago , he himself was the scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for story@@ telling wants to preserve urban linguistic diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the en@@ um@@ eration of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the uns@@ ur@@ passed blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of language from major cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk is that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers put their history first and foremost in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and their presentation lead to the fact that the audience is involved .
they cry out laugh@@ ing and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of Daf@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the Fa@@ bel of Rab@@ bit and the Pavi@@ an in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his ability , John Ny@@ ag@@ ara asks : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in he shares his feeling of exclu@@ siv@@ ity :
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers are hoping to extend it . anyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story narrative guides .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Puerto Rico ur@@ ges the US to re@@ inst@@ ate government debt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the aim of re @-@ examining the public debt of Puerto Rico , which tot@@ alled 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the March started at the Vatican Cap@@ it@@ ol , the capital &apos;s government building , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ vic &apos;s front for the re@@ vis@@ ing of the debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of the restructuring of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt will be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the state alliance , integrated sovereign territory of the USA - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit @-@ independent non @-@ profit organization with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed on the outside will be dangerous without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration bore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night@@ life for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints &apos; completed books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive After@@ market ) .
the book , published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what is the true cost with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about its current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push@@ es for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own f@@ ates , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 , she was contacted by people who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his place of residence and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project called Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ que &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ active than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here , Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything in mind , to wipe out this architecture , which is not only em@@ bodied in the cultural heritage of Syria , but of the world .
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and bass taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book@@ store by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens during each visit ,
that I sink into the world of your beautiful eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ourselves ,
that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the prison of prison
and I &apos;ll go into every detail of your voice and words
that I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes bid farewell
and I will let another piece of my soul leave with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ laim all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year goes by , my soul
during the day
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ que &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or subjected to violence by the regime were tortured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our call today in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mozambique : back to previous post because of corruption convic@@ ted director
Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger against a corruption in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence when the corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other defend@@ ants in 2010 with four other defend@@ ants .
the money came from public money from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was given by the Council of Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his res@@ etting to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who rejected the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post because the company did not complete any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we are aware of is that even the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the contrary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the company apparently held no adequate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been cut off .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director doesn &apos;t have any mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ts him . I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ als to return to the state , but it had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it operated only on the state itself .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ be@@ et prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves are part of Sam@@ ora &apos;s prison . not only will the Mozambique Front be remembered as the first independent president , but also as sharp , thou@@ ghtful and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral representations , when he vigor@@ ously affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that he is not so . he changes the tactics but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions also declined :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he was 10 years old and released .
and today the company , in which he mis@@ ses money , sets him under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ resour@@ ceful ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) 12 . may 2017
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to dt . : @ Truth ) states that crime pays off in Mozambique :
in fact , to be in # Mos@@ ambique th@@ ief and servant of the # F@@ rel@@ imo pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , sentenced to long possible detention , returns to # Air@@ ports of Mozambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ d@@ Sam@@ bo ) May 11 , 2017
Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ors many users wrong@@ ly
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the known social network took their posts out of the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ors the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or as a part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ u@@ sive con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of useful content on its platform .
today &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been cens@@ ored .
furthermore , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spi@@ der b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail from one of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to ease his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question phrase ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook ought to be analy@@ tic before it wor@@ sens all posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook doesn &apos;t delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ e@@ ook .
what should be done instead is to carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the next words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , get a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who propag@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned by the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive by Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from writing , posting and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their views against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post has been removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post the author shared his views on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ins believes that Facebook is supposed to have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
to cens@@ or such words will bring even more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they didn &apos;t try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they only had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great deal of sales , that would be great .
the automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among the users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also inc@@ ite violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critic@@ ised for its failure to control the growing hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the child marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law bann@@ ing this practice , so that the age of marriage is now 18 .
in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( I@@ RO ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , since that is , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN child rights convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined every person under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics by the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had been married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed at abol@@ ishing laws for the child marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly they helped bring about this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say the critics of the child before they were to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really difficult thing , and at some point , doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft bill against the child marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law declare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle once again posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the child marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one voted against it .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws for the child marriage had finally been changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who has a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that has concealed the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the chil@@ dr@@ ens are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ o @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : news , news !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
torture Mut@@ ota , belonging to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about the importance of the adoption of the law , noted :
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation of 18 years .
the draft for the amendment of the married couple was decided today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 dep@@ uties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all MEPs who were opposed have voted for the law .
the child marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ birth sign abuse .
many thanks to all activists who fought for him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our dep@@ uties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps , should the law be passed away , and he seems to dissolve his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to proceed against the law , most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject in a different way .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
better Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion in a general way , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of talking about the problem that the state , which protects our daughters from being ab@@ used , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children are legal or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , although there are laws that they prohi@@ bit .

by mirr@@ oring web pages Turkish users can once again view Wikipedia contents
the Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , dark@@ ened internationally .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey has been blocking the popular cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia , based on crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day after day becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
although many techni@@ c@@ ached Internet users are used to using wra@@ pping tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was passed .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine computer connections ) , which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is still available despite legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the news ( about blocking Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to cover sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents on a decentr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was performed independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pa@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ Page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to host similar mur@@ als when banned in the respective country Wikipedia .

it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you attack another URL , which is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server continues to guide the query to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection

photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motives and washed out colors .
that motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal to the international scene .
and his hom@@ etown next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this prime location in his work helps him :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I was just resting at home when suddenly Navar@@ res@@ e ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the Leopard was and I immediately started to cra@@ p pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he was already facing tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b itself from the opinion of the sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I too was on the way home because of the darkness when the king of the boy suddenly appeared . he sat down immediately , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to make photos of Ot@@ ters in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations .
see below some of these photos .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ tik@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid speaking with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to the social pressure they respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm , maintain this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a false court and rejected by her family and village community after addressing a married relative with his name .
the tradition of their wives also does not name their wives is common among men . however , they have far fewer rights to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , played a unique club , thus became the main subject of the city .
it is a place only for them where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al which is run by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and campaig@@ ned for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
for seven years Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ste has been working with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as child marriage and the exile of HIV and AIDS infected people , and manages these clubs .
she reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video showing the Roh@@ ini in their discussion was by women who don &apos;t name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the discussion about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women could easily identify .
the names of their hus@@ bands do not speak lou@@ dly , is a custom that they all maintain and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him now by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion basket .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then they all asked , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they put the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women should never speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so shy that she just ki@@ cked off during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing it .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ alin rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands on their behalf .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a lot of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in the head of the women : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member chose to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini meant I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ete out in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the chin @-@ red dot on the forehead that indicates the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the zin@@ ok red dot if he would do it .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not stopped working completely with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with each discussion basket . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their life ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example , like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to say certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they happen .
in a discussion group , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing .
some women in the group have borne only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ m @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a trousers , they didn &apos;t dar@@ ed .
after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of the choice of clothing , the mor@@ als associated with sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled its own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round , so that the women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini are sure they will make it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their husband .
some , including me , do it , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be seen in the Japanese t@@ witter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed by the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noted for the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
it became clear to people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ ui@@ chi Is@@ aka , president of the retail store Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan . at the time of 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo .
even today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese central schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today , Beat@@ les Day is a memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pupp@@ et John L@@ enn@@ on is supposed to represent or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places connected with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely must visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Ma@@ thew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be qu@@ ir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today , Beat@@ les Day is a memorial day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
and of course some companies also use the fan base in terms of market conditions , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! ! today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could this be for a day ?

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be the target of attacks in Mozambique .

a new system of ab@@ duction of individuals for organ trafficking , presumably for dis@@ believers , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
it gives the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a man of a bald man could bring gold or bring wealth , explained the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in the neighbouring country Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
respect to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , warned the Mos@@ ambique police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three men @-@ headed men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the assass@@ inations took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ sta@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the man @-@ headed men .
the persecution and murder of headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also allu@@ des to the police of the Republic of Mozambique in dis@@ cord ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims in the head might have power that generated riches .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
on Facebook Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty of which Mozambique is facing :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME ashamed A country in which the people would have shame to go to the streets and would not hurt others or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or bald headed for dev@@ out purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are ch@@ ased , aiming to gain wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humour .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter users twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police officer Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both cross @-@ headed :

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our heart@@ felt sympathy to his family , friends and all those who have known and loved him .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in expanding access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in the Arab B@@ logger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ el &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by individuals who themselves out@@ sider the Assad government .
they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ el &apos;s stay and constitution were still unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we are showing the honour of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement .
and we acknowledge the efforts of all the people and organizations that have deployed for his release in the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , thus the organization of Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime or forci@@ bly disappeared are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody , the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the detained Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China called Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and says a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to appeal to the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him a treatment abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway Finn@@ mark
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway collap@@ sed , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the EU &apos;s top @-@ class diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us as announced in a statement on 30 June :
we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife as well as family members .
they are to meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA There are no translations available
&quot; &quot; &quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the invitation of the U.S. embassy attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the foreign ministry that &quot; no country has the right to intervene and make ir@@ responsible statements about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley reported that China ought to offer the couple :
protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice upon which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .

Germany and the United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had great concerns about whether the whi@@ rl@@ wind around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit in Hamburg .
Canada Go to the top
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called for China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France and France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry called for China in an explanation on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will ultimately receive it .
Taiwan Stra@@ i@@ ght
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Rural Affairs in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature of Yu @-@ Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the ailing intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 , around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being .
he spoke about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt very moved and encouraged also when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was supposed to be considered a city .
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of meeting the international branch of the Association of Bar Association of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported that Singapore was to be considered a city .
... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he was defending an idea , according to which one could not measure Singapore &apos;s political system with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in the face of it , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core of the topic , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers , preten@@ ding demo@@ crats to be demo@@ crats , leaving the twisted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end , the responses given last week by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were really non @-@ rep@@ lies to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system .
he tar@@ red the corresponding questions with non @-@ rep@@ lies rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , because she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point if he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
while An@@ on publishes his commentary on the blog , he points to the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference in order to better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities witnessed a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - be I with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure whether he really believes it , and is aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review de@@ parts the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a spokes@@ man for Freu@@ d ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet of government , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay back our Prime Minister ?
what is the value of our pink staff certificate ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , has always been a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world being exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question asked most to me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
for my clari@@ fication then usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook with anger , if they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans attach a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack when they travel .
everyone loves Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everybody seems to think that Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if I was mistaken for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice , &quot; is basically to be idle - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no verti@@ ces and edges , nothing that one can encounter .
being harmless is to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to pay attention .
this can be a good thing if one wants to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that happen around one .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justi@@ n Tru@@ deau top the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada really sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ o@@ des the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells the rules his girlfriend makes .
although not explicitly political , the music video still refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists told the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has consistently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution granting absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adju@@ st@@ ment Change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was also established in the army , which monitors the online content and persons accused of being slan@@ dered by the monarchy is prosec@@ uted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand is a stri@@ k@@ ingly opposed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ ority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ esty insul@@ t ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta is still pursuing is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video shows how people are thrown into a black vans before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the &quot; Tri@@ bute from Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch @-@ opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Uzbekistan

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society only reco@@ vers very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages in the northern part of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ dro@@ j@@ ava are located in the basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Eur@@ asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians were living and working together to Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , most of the Russians live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s which are called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ uk@@ ho@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elder man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all served by the community .
now there is only paved road with pale magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have meanwhile abandoned the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty residents live .
approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ow@@ kas , which still host one or two families , can be seen at the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to be photographed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply prohibited us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago an elderly woman called Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pensions are just 9 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not have a vegetable garden or a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with their own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when war began .
every day she reminds herself of the village life before the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha is receiving approximately $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mines .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was located , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have any fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
as our conversation turns to the end , a little boy conf@@ esses us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
while they are running , some of them throw stones on the deca@@ yed buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure trouble in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is managed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ ar frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in ted@@ dy bears .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . however , they know many of the names M@@ om Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells , people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on boxes outside .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them drugs that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that drew exhausted feet from the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he responds with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and her three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they went to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know a lot about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps well known here , but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their little house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking station outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela says he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single person , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is back with guests .
in the corri@@ dors the travellers will consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother , she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care , whom she has made an Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she imag@@ ines her briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities area in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their cell phones .
on July 10 , mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city U@@ rum@@ qi received a phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clean@@ up &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app will prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but k@@ Ã²@@ n@@ sow@@ y the authorities also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police said that the app would investigate and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online sc@@ ams , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications about digital cens@@ orship in China are mostly focused on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south , reality is often a glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often assign extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( at the top of the page ) , the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , it could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment through the reproduction technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( at the top of the page ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system and thus gets unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computer and mobile phones turn into electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council Council to minimize the spread of illegal contents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all government branches , authorities and institutions affiliated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
an up @-@ to @-@ date report from Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi an ordin@@ ance with the directive to all residents and contractors to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard disks , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos , &quot; but this action viol@@ ates the Person@@ ality Rights of U@@ rum@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those referring to peaceful religious or political communications .
sleep or death , part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything has disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able both from the inside and from the outside .
one that makes all glory to her name .
one that has kno@@ cked down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow any metaph@@ ors .
but when the reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters transform themselves into beings of flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams for death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even when the earth moves on the axis of evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution as we@@ eds during a peaceful protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to destroy the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all quarters were cov@@ eted , my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I didn &apos;t set high demands on a city that has been st@@ amped down to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a splendid picture that filled my expectations completely .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of security service .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I do now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you &apos;re only brave enough to shout when we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes set up on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look at my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was because of my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary and his father equally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father equ@@ als with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed proposition is still in my nose today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental torture that I had been exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I em@@ ulate all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they have given me a larger cell this time .
I have to share it with only one more prisoner and may put myself at once without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell , and I res@@ or@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : beat with the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ help &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness , no prominent features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to ch@@ ase all these crow@@ s , which are lab@@ elled at the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from afar , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries are ring@@ ing , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; allu@@ ding to the 13th se@@ ers of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the secret : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close eye view of their world view .
this is not a house , which is not a land here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I have used it to not answer .
I can no longer tell exactly when insul@@ ts and beats have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly chat .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice said in me that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to make this penalty .
in punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls this lovingly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not yet enough for him , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector or whether that belonged to normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a giant cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them alternate while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t take any pleasure in it , which is why he was next to an electrically loaded rod .
electricity f@@ lowed my whole body , enough to supply my entire district .
my semi @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness van@@ ished and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must worry about terrible sorrow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk away , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he hur@@ ls to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to escape from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( about : farmers ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world .
with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind , and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special reluct@@ ance against American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , has something to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian f@@ lown from the second generation , &quot; he den@@ otes himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own life circumstances so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he sh@@ uts Nes@@ cafÃ© in water in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ sel@@ ess hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically speaking , the sli@@ pping of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the ra@@ kes of the K@@ ent @-@ Cig@@ ar@@ ettes in the nose first of all speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when one looks at the neighbouring countries .
therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - not to land in prison .
recently the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual face @-@ singer Ham@@ ed sensu@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dep@@ uties and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; straight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian nation as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continues to advocate for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might not be simple rhetor@@ ic , but in fact reflecting a more and more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b brought traditional gender ma@@ ids to the body by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently settled woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they actually should trust .
in recent years , the number of &apos; Ehren@@ mor@@ de &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour kill@@ ings in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still more ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is missing institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in@@ definitely in prison &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee from the family are often required that the woman will not be done .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
politics was in@@ timi@@ dated , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;d ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sant@@ ander &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this song , a verse often repe@@ ats :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - whether faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ genei@@ ty or homosexu@@ ality .
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program , Ro@@ ya , to remember later that his comments were torn out of context , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but it was only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ it , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b is asking himself : if Abu Nu@@ die , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices were sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service established several former government representatives and members of the teacher &apos;s association , with the reason that they have critically commented on the issues raised in social media with the corruption rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural re@@ think in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now den@@ ounced M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any intervention abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a true and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ ficially created demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until the time comes , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is thought that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the wag@@ ons , drums and dancing have been handed over more than one thousand years and come from a time when armies from West Japan mar@@ ched to the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ ary , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two for@@ lor@@ ries are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a breath @-@ taking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ tall car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ ans trade arms against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

outer appearances and body care rarely were as important as in this history , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate job like that of the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to Lima &apos;s historic center - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trafficking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other medi@@ um@@ - and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to becoming more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the outer limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dressing art , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district , where we are very proud , because from love to the children we built this educational community .
Colombia : letter of Love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important , people who feel em@@ powered to meet affection ?
this is exactly what prompted the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Ram@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
recently their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace agreement with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was considered as significant that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
but before the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to war rhetor@@ ic , and around the clock carried their weapons with them , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now absorb them into their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian convinced that the young Colom@@ bians must join together and help in the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - messages of love to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in February 2017 in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people who needed the most urgent need this year .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC fighters who now find their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
to date , more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transmit the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC were on the way they had done before to receive orders from their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings can be passed in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ pl@@ ets &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was sorry for the war too , was sorry to be the faithful companion of this fighter all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected something else from life as a war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I have learned only how to deal with weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
at the beginning , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were joined by a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as a war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social injustice caused by the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who have never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate those with beautiful feelings turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country is living is painful for me .
but it comforts me that all people , including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bians were proph@@ esi@@ ed that after the dis@@ armament of peace there would be peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people ready to resort to arms , to rise and to protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ osexual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers such as discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the coverage of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community at the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not only occurred over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered international head@@ lines several months after reports have been published that themati@@ ze the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , throwing a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who took suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ gender woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood she felt she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a sure place for her , which was why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gene@@ alogy of their country@@ woman , the hunt was opened to Sab@@ rina .
for fear of her life , she moved to the United States in the last analysis .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a trans@@ gender who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , made a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me .
after that , the photos of my documents made the round by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just doing some shopping bags from my car back seat , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you spot ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up at the hospital in the last analysis .
apparently some women had got everything and began to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung .
OC Media : what ail@@ ments have you been placed in - in which the men or women of women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women .
for this I am very grateful to him .
when I first read his name at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some perfectly unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they put absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad speech and Photos@@ hop .
I have cup size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother was too much and she put a rope around his neck .
luckily the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number sign with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , I realized that there was something rotten .
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you escape ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought it without registering me , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I plu@@ gged the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re in safety just because you left the country ?
our people know in what hotel you &apos;re in . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a t@@ abo@@ o subject .
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements still carry me in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with the camera , I really try to figure out how the person looks at which she reminds herself of her past - that is , my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who has imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan was barely able to wait and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with that , I mean , they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : will men still hold gay men in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many .
if , then , above all those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately immersed in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken .
until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits but there were no reports yet . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orientation have already happened in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny before 2003 when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to bring us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately rejected us in the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored lashes , wearing red@@ dish jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never even curved a hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of sick people .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television .
he did not speak about us per se , but above all about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - one could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who were laugh@@ ing and laugh@@ ing at first looked at you at once with suspicion .
in the meantime , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deterior@@ ating .
OC Media : what activities are you going on now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ps , meetings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I have no p@@ enny for it .
I have discovered these people themselves when I ab@@ ap@@ ed influ@@ xes .
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ drop ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to make you white with foam before the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ age@@ stan@@ a have what the cab@@ ard@@ ines have , the Russians also have what ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
you know , many think at transition to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be exact , different attitudes .
it is the most important thing for me to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will become so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all for that - I just know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian A@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
for the past few months there has been a sharp rise in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 pushed the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ation was so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have caught up .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all the family fathers who felt hel@@ pless because of persecution from the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took over power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets little from that wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime has systematically denied the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs workplaces in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large number of dam@@ s , the water from the Arabic regions to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying .
these dam@@ s have only led to devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi adolescents now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general manager for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed the primary school , completed 55 % a secondary school , and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arabic ancest@@ or is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national Resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arabic names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . taken by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons license .
the following article is a revised version of the statement auth@@ ored by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminine in general .
for example , nowadays , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women meet a glass ceiling earlier or later in diverse areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to speak on skin color , on racism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motiv@@ ational violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to the school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women to have all men and all men of any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join myself as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to take account of injusti@@ ces in her thinking , which refer to the sex as well as the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a human@@ ly and margin@@ alised being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to explain white women the importance of the overl@@ apping of skin color and sex . because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to reward them for a better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different backgrounds a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism completely and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which has been called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming , says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , emotional , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call for separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
I will be recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed nor ignored , nor rejected .

in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his community .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells .
scientists from all over the world fear that decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ berg - a subsidiary of Water@@ keepers Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist , based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work lies on pursued , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co @-@ operative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult struggle against violence

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ saal . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ tly ein@@ clu@@ stered ) , which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected individuals .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis her .
since the end of their relationship some time has gone by and the police said that their statement would be put to the acts , but more cannot be done .
when another woman presented Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of abuse , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez also noted the ac@@ ten@@ tious display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez .
a few days later , the second woman retired her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
when women permit an ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit to be victims of violence , are in fact reported to the law enforcement authorities .
content 1 Stri@@ ps and statistics 2 invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system that does not under@@ ni@@ v@@ 3 Paragu@@ ay@@ ay &apos;s laws : good approach , lack of implementation pun@@ ches and statistics
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ gy@@ ms , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are different data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the available numbers , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General filed 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . at 70 % of them , it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were over 5000 ads of domestic violence in the courts of peace . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women reported that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics however do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay due to psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on any woman who is ref@@ und@@ able due to physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a private criminal , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists included at least 12 cases of suicide in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does not take anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do it , but then gradually gave it . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she inherited the psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognis@@ able :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happened to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about mal@@ treatment by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing a name , she posted posts on Facebook where she described her insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhetor@@ ical if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for nearly eight years to prove that her former partner ab@@ used them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started beating them .
Victori@@ as ads with the authorities remained without result and even from their relatives , they received no support .
she conducted a trial against her former partner , who developed into an im@@ penet@@ rable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ ay &apos;s laws : good approach , lack of translation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not being used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a bill was discussed at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # fÃ¼r@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the Movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non@@ natives ) are part of a campaign sponsored by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft of the law seems to explain fem@@ ici@@ d to an independent criminal record and to punish tough@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the legal text was changed in some points to also win the MEPs for the law that advoc@@ ated the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original draft law fores@@ aw most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , which have to bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they simply permit an ad and want to get a secure housing , to raise the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funding for it :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a re@@ thinking has to take place here , so violence can no longer be seen as something normal .
those who keep silent in the face of these facts make themselves guilty and contribute to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators will be punished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to allow for such a long time until mis@@ handling is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been modified , among other things , a passage which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions about the changes are taking place .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law applies as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media continue to attack in Oman one year after a newspaper &apos;s ban
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Indian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ te .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he will serve a one @-@ year prison term .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and placed on trial , but later released .
Oman ruled in 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid who came to power after he had de@@ posed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sul@@ t@@ ans &apos; rule is marked by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular domestic intelligence services , public liber@@ ties , including press freedom , restrictions and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists to torture , in@@ timi@@ date and incar@@ cer@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in public authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces seized I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , after an article published on 26 July 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties joining hands of justice . &quot; this led to corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and interference of senior officials in court decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Legal Affairs Committee , was invited by the ISS to the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is capture .
the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the directive that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way , including online , is prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial in Mas@@ kat was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned for dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of a violation of a ban on the public and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1,000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a damages deposit of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced him to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the imprisonment of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he has served his year@@ ling sentence .
the Court of Appe@@ al also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
despite the decision of the court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Korean government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further order in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again placed himself against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to restore the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in recent times the press freedom was viol@@ ated .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Alb@@ anian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Indian authorities to :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and neighbouring states by promoting freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to gather , support and protect themselves peac@@ efully .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Fig@@ ure takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious consequences in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for exploring these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping establish own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Central Laboratory at the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he explored the HIV virus himself before deciding to go home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( discla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .

how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being a maker yourself .
the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how large is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research on space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
the system that magazines can only be made available against payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky first appeared on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of salad he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents are not only suitable for individual types , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ els . because of this trend plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food safety for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on is still breeding salad , but it takes longer , as his work becomes more and more difficult due to increasing restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river there is a b@@ oul@@ der around which I must spin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new salad sort , because all the features have already been patented . &quot;
however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours to use no material protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have cul@@ tured and eaten red tube sal@@ at of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source seed initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus are permanently usable for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US breeders can commit that other seed @-@ bred seeds can be freely used by them .
however , this does not mean that they will not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others to cross their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately hi@@ ring them - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to seed , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be pat@@ ched , whether vegetables , grains , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says , taking into account the increasingly frequent mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , as it is offered for example on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool shr@@ inks continually due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights available on plant material .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all cart@@ el features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be usable either at all or difficult .
there are no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salads or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted characteristics - such by which their taste or color improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders decreases by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predic@@ tive due to climate change .
in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property includes other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing the public with more material and expertise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mort@@ on sees this differently : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you need to wait so long to grow crops that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight already .
but the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders do not have time or money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want to facilitate farmers their work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we can &apos;t continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics ourselves .
the plants form them themselves and as breeders , we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in the US state of Oreg@@ on and Os@@ si , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety , breeds its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for their cultivation require massive her@@ bi@@ cides , which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) , most smaller seed companies manage to survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both are the case .

in addition , Mort@@ on believes breeders should be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties within a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one is protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy in my opinion . &quot;
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , carries out an open @-@ source seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional crop varieties , the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license , which ultimately forms a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si @-@ obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , because the Os@@ si obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open @-@ source seed systems for which the official starting signal should be launched next year .
an association from environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report . it believes that farmers must have the opportunity to come to seeds , exchange it and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also emphasizes the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes for more people to see him soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest cens@@ orship goals in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents and reports human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities for this step sharply critici@@ zed and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remained loyal to its goal to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to expose the freedom of opinion and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network originating from Qatar due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of site blocks to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of data for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of Colum@@ ns and articles that he writes for in Egypt non @-@ accessible websites and media .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Zi@@ onists blog is located , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , when he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the block@@ ade by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blogs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ wa al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a siege , an arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) They proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , albeit only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now after they have locked him and that they are scar@@ ed of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the courageous will walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of vendors , through the circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
she reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such practices indicate the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that could have access to Egyptian users .
in addition , the situation is worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which it can proceed against these actions in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants dispute .
the Brazilian Army was deployed in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ Ã³@@ i , a town in Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

day after day newspapers in the whole of Brazil report head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard designs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air@@ waves to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio in 2017 for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; known for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it announced a new column called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . anything that devi@@ ates from civil@@ ised standards and what happens only in Rio , is published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : it is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial the paper continues :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to hide the atro@@ cities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; is the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than it benefits ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira is argu@@ ing against the violence as &quot; war . &quot; in her opinion this is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible persons in the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service .
as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the statistics of 2015 , Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the mor@@ es per state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra is owned by Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has been repeating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures also included the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by Rio de Janeiro in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police pot and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline in violent deaths . for some years , however , the U@@ PP has increasingly been bombar@@ ded by har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles in 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the human being .
for this demands the state to use means and ways typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio are still suffering .
one week it is now that the police kl@@ om@@ m the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute , The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b .
the region east of Gh@@ out@@ a , where chemical weapons attack on August 21 , 2013 , demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege from Damascus , which led to the need for local residents to be smu@@ g@@ gled on local or through tunnels and check@@ points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teach Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as inhabitants as they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive food source for many local residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ torate of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , spoke to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that it has been fighting for three years to announce this project and express its relief that it is now becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to raise funds for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da , we use the humanitarian crowd funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of planting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 4 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel short@@ ages , locally produced plastics are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they started with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from the regions originating from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards they planted a small mushroom court in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food residue ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) for the production of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and the siege are visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in conflict areas and help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese are calling for justice for the victims of the 2017 &apos; s
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the week before in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the last week of solidarity with victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in Gali@@ cia in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 explo@@ sions , spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon area .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there are only 4 districts no fire .
all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017
some of Twitter users divided pictures :

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the predictable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire prevention measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people wondered why civilians were unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al of the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal explained the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o there were roads and villages for everything and nothing evacu@@ ated .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the form of forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government carried out a loos@@ ening of the law that allowed construction activity if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val resum@@ ed in the same article from the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of readily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , always extend to fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when citizens sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that supplied the population with information : it used the own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers stopped the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million acc@@ esses .

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family during dinner .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Has@@ an @-@ dominated party , He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Taliban , known for their hatred on the Haz@@ ara , have come closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan again .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sack@@ cloth with mort@@ ars , which were heavier than himself , in order to earn his living .
back then , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really tough , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ pen came to Italy in 2002 .
for some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid in need twice a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high incidence rates . it is also true that the conditions found in the country are disa@@ strous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3,000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially submit an application for asylum - which can be drawn after the registration of the asylum application for months .
until then , people who do not have money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined li@@ fest@@ yles helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ pen put all his savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes , and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp restaurant in Pad@@ ua , Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a Pizzeria and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s objectives extend far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and the retail sector , and return to the country , which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are also opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily , if I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent the half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and cann@@ ing techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ pen has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
citizen report : charges from Egypt allow shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the release of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ations &apos;s Ne@@ eds Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government authority .
users must register to use social networks within six months of submitting their full name as well as their ID number within six months of the authority &apos;s website .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the final payment of a penalty .
the law , which has been promoted by sixty members of Parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another MP submitted a legislative proposal in which har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the President or a high officials would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the law , such a deed would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , legal experts from the Tah@@ rir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who fought against the military coup that led to the deportation of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
like more than 700 prot@@ esters who had been arrested in the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting for four years in prison for a trial .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed until May 20 , because the prison administration , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , including false charges of amongst others weapons collection , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza was acqu@@ itted by two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block at the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ vi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the punishment of the journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists listen to scre@@ ened documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was princip@@ ally inter@@ ro@@ gated to a sever@@ ed action plan . said plan was provided by the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial bill that would ensure business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all un@@ law@@ fully received funds .
the document published on 21 April at Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website sheds light on how the President &apos;s plans for the support of the legislation look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case .
does China want to force the users of social media to demonstrate their identification ?
according to new rules of the information bure@@ au of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before writing or sharing news in social media .
in addition , it is stated in the rules that registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts believe that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will use these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only sel@@ ectively enforce these regulations in order to protect the citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat ? &quot;
not in Russia !
may May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat obstruc@@ ted the registration of the state government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of the distribution of information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 Act , thanks to which the Russian Government performs a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for the removal of content and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites currently include websites like V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ ess@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish Court features lock Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was closed because it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to promote a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff around
after this week , the UK government finds itself in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real @-@ time and install Backdoor @-@ Program@@ s that encryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
