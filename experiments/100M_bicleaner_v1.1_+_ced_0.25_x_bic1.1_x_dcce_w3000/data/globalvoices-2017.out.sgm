<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and practised his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered a murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was like the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA has only strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very warm love letter written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain, as it says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican pre-election was the highest number ever reached by a candidate nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't tune up Trump and his voters with the people I got to know during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that takes people from all over the world, a deeply devout person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Trumps couldn't agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer," "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the" "" "Phoenix Suns" "" "while playing." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still adapts to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me to get used to the complexity of American life with a lot of patience and grace.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump knew his way to nominee Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, presided over a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks at those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(OB): as much as" "" "white against all the other ethnicities" "", "" "" "white" "" "in reference to the whites and whiplash, which means" "" "big Van Jones" "", "has exactly killed what America has made so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyman, whose history, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the election Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the White America's promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">All this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "Afro-Americans have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would someone not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "" "thank God Mr. Trump, this is not your America." "" "36 hours later he was corrected." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son had fallen sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is Trumps Land now, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca share with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played at both places has changed not only the life of the children but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a big garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among the tourists -but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, La banda de MÃºsica (music bande) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest to the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But after a coincidental meeting with a French pilot, this changed a musical project and the youth offered such a rare ray of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and playing with glittering eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpania, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with remanufactured instruments made up of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all made out of the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage The kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays instruments made of recycled material and which calls itself The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary named" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic MÃ¼lllandfill) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practised solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known then that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liberia, before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorns, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing licence.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of the plundering of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (stop Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister back from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing" "", "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegally Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing had been hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snail stamp, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen in real time, trackable at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open seas via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships fishing in prohibited areas. there are also suspicious driving routes - such as those suggesting that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly also whether they have a criminal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose every year because of the illegal fishing that invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, so the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include sailing under false flag, bogus license papers, phantasies, fishing protected species and fishing in conservation areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say" You may not run my port. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" "" "and this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front is working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed forged licences in Tanzania. ships discovered that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland thus helps build a system that combines different levels of information. FISH-i is to help to find criminal-acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana marine protection organization: a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of each trackable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who's doing - it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project where a global system allows the pursuit of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had previously fished without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences, now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats have purchased more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found tow grids on board, whose use was forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear every year due to illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">Six countries joined forces there in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i.. "security is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only was the ship travelling without a license and were used towing nets which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also invaded into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 is a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working across the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>
<seg id="152">Their articles appear in Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and Guardian. situation in Venezuela continues to escalate: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of "conquering the country"</seg>
<seg id="153">The movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on impeachment of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture by MarÃ­a Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="156">Released under Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="157">After the government rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum, the Venezuelans reacted, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into the void by gathering in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the retreat of Venezuela) both images of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andean regions of MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the central-north of Carabobo and Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is continually worsening, which is reflected in the daily life of Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the impeachment of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, but ultimately the reluctance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-founder of Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum on impeachment for many is considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The election alliance Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica, or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces, the demonstrators were to join a mass rally on the 27th of October, as well as a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, on 3 November, should continue the blocking of the referendum on impeachment.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among others, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3, all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, images circulate about confrontations, as well as reports of oppression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially large waves hit the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There, the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the government according to their own statement from the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safe again, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police forces, including this woman in the Andean State of TÃ¡chira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in TÃ¡chira do not wear skirts, because otherwise you could see something that many national gardensts do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic shows the round that covers the amount of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to see the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now spoke against his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, investigates crimes committed during the Argentine military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought that was ok.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerie. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quiyanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of redemption.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have made friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass just that they don't have to kidnap you one day and I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers "party in Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me that I would become envy.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base I had to destroy documents belonging to the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks where cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large lump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were removed and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>

<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photos by Joshua Levine, widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a inhabitant of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which appears in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that nobody has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">"" "the erroneous English translation was first removed. the term" "" "terrible drivers" "" "was later replaced by the appropriate, albeit grammatically correct term" "" "elder drivers" "" "(German:" "" "older drivers" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported on the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that elderly people felt insulted by the inadequate correction of our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online intelligence service J-Cast News addressed a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers that are implicated in accidents across the country, however, is quite a matter of concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and to transfer active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - native speakers should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">So a French native speaker should translate for example from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ any employees with English as their mother tongue, who could translate translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translating, cost-finding or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have a foreign workforce can still produce translations in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to be a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with luscious results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic sets produced by machine translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. however, by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, we can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Home page of the Navegar con Libertad portal (free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by opposition groups who opposed the government NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was overlapped, and advised the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the side of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers like Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant in reporting on protests since 2014. back then, the Commission threatened to punish them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission looked at this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two liters of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">Later, the local NGO VEsinfiltro confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online stations. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS server requests specific domains are reputable.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server will reply erroneously or refuse to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the broadcast was discontinued on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was put into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes it increasingly difficult for the Venezuelans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Voices with kindly permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("flying cows, decaying schools") edited and re-published by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one who has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as a cripson for the family. in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a big family with little money passes her age-old son or her underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange the child gets food, training and a roof above the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children need to do housework for countless days, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for several years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke to Criaditas, especially young girls who were affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collecting testimonies, researching and denouncing.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that crimped the crimp is generally still silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double delusion," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, which has their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education, improve their position in society and "do something out of themselves," can be transferred to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, who takes the girl with herself and justifies its exploitation with the faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon, which is taking place in the secretaries of Paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to the hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed traces of violent blows. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military member TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira came to MarÃ­n with a stick until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a cripta.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo deep in the Paraguayan society responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They designated Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be no other Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos have been widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows than children are registered," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her cripta.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n might be trend-setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as workers; they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work now and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital of AsunciÃ³n as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In their employer's house Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays, for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner it was finished with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the master's library as food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">On some evenings the housekeeper Alvarenga forced to stand alongside him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media on the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he kept them intelligently, but didn't talk to her." "" "the master had found someone to listen while talking about politics," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"" "" "" "they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would learn" "" "bad habits" "" "there again." ""</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible, explained them.</seg>
<seg id="474">She was, however, fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also at school Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing about which almost never is spoken are bullying and the chicans who are exposed to criaditas when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cripta.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anybody to go home. I didn't have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I didn't belong to any group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Society approves the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="481">In January 2015, a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share ads for cleaning staff and children's girls in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="483">Hello! I'm looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon.</seg>

<seg id="488">A woman from the place Ãemby wrote that she had an eleven-year-old girl and gave her phone number.</seg>

<seg id="495">In the prologue to the report Criaditas, Â¿hasta cuÃ¡ndo?</seg>
<seg id="496">(Criaditas, how long ago?), a collection of testimonies of former Criaditas, writes Ortiz:</seg>
<seg id="497">In the course of our history we have managed to abolish systems such as slavery, CuÃ±adazgo (a practice from the prehistory of Paraguay, where the Spanish Conquistadores, the Conquistadores, the women of Guarani were enslaved and Spanish indoctrination), and the system of MensÃº (where the workers were considered semi-slaves), and that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery, in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="502">"" "sixty Egyptian parliamentary representatives recently voted in favour of a draft bill on" "" "regulations on usage and benefits of social networks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="503">When adopted by the Parliament, users of social media must register in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "based on the law, a place would then be set up to grant citizens a permit to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fines.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, composed of six paragraphs and cursed in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any use that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities ought to impose the registration. it is unclear how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, a parliamentary committee and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password to get through the firewall that blocked Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of them it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not yet been known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "Senior Research Calculator") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they violently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, this means that they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a trial.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not, the draft "is in line with a pro-military mode of thinking in the parliament, in which the control is maximised and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the screen," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the parliamentary committee, Tamer El-Shahawy, proposed a bill against cyber crime in which a life sentence was provided for those who are found guilty of "threatening public order" and "protest to protest."</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the Non-Governmental Organisation, Nature Iraq, are working to protect the phantastic Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the bigger family of leopards, who argue through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they always find less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depend on a large predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video thus determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera body, Raza breaks out in sheer delight.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist Raza passionately shows another side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies of wild animals and the education programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and the region is still busy with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, the northeast of Japan, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi Prefecture has been a state prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring countectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami evacuated entire coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The prefecture of Fukushima was still experiencing a nuclear accident, and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from local point of view, which progress has been reached six years after, in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="550">Housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacements (at the same time, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to see the biggest success among the three prefectures, here, 80 percent of the planned substitutes were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses while Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, still, six years after the catastrophe, the evacuation of temporary shelters (at the same time, casetsu juutaku), is still trying to resettle in final surrogates.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima in 2011 are still living in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuees living after the disaster in temporary shelters were resettled into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo-Newspaper ascertained, 1074 of 1,100 schools that were affected by accident have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, Fukushima has resumed only 30 percent of fishing harbours.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have largely affected agricultural land in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima are in the" "" "nuclear" "" "zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has largely recovered, but Fukushima is still far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal residents find it more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain an overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys amongst the local population and among the evacuees. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her feeling changed vis-Ã -vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey showed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents found that still not enough in terms of catastrophes has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to evacuate the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition on the occasion of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo-newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63,000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were resettled into durable surrogates.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the 2017 status, 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuees still live in Behelfsshelters are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When you meet people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater at first than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often realises that one more connects than it appears at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni speaks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherita explains how the love of music overcame the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="594">Reight: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widespread photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care station this week: last Friday, a police officer during a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia struck him with a stick against his head. nationwide, millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the University of GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a skull trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on him this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s announced that Sampaio had been suspended from active service until the end of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he hits in GoiÃ¢nia with his baton on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralizador," a media campaigner by Media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz, in which one can see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics come to him shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from another perspective, has also appeared in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip below you can see the attack on Mateus ab the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilians Reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the costs of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in GoiÃ¢nia while he is in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="608">"be brave, Mateus.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado recalls further violent attacks against activists in GoiÃ¡s:</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s experiences a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was murdered by his father, because he had sabotaged the Occupy movement in secondary schools. and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who is on the intensive care unit after he has been attacked by a police officer who has beaten him with a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police raid attacks</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil, where there was brutal police operations against demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers were deployed in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for orators, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The deputy, Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have plagued the street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagonist: a window of windows.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting about a broken glass window in order to make a photo of their pages illustratively.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo preferred a cover story with a fire-set bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window of windows than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" receives an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by headlines with the title "protesters on the confrontation course with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The villages forgotten by the de-industralization in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Alvaro Reynoso Act, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The community of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After laying down the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive period because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers to have heard that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already withstood the plagues, the case of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago, but the bad harvest is no longer a news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">However, the sugar price rose again over a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 Report "Agricultural inspectors" published by the OECD and FAO, the UN Agricultural and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on began the process of restructuring in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeated most is "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents were in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially distributed documents, which would be distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the address and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was postponed and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the discontinued factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane mills still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waits for retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations community in Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour since 2014, workshop leaders have launched mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups Songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked together with ten Cree communities in North Quebec and then with the Cree hip-hop-group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop therefore addresses the young participants in talks on topics such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of Tears," a road in Western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always speak the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagookii Cree First Nation added, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northathstars Hip-Hop group, who gave them a stopper in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the strophe is available in transcript, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to keep going my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will take our scream</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and go forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what the Creator has appointed.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, are exhibited near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru ("Plastische Model of Courts") from any food served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic courts and decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a lot of these small companies that produce plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic courts are so common that they do not even notice them. however, a new trend changes today into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new mobile tapes decorated with plastic courts, as shown at the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shooters fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of food supplies is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaise-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we have found a good use as a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple holding your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the cell phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comical.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other whimsical plastic courts can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow the hashtag # hashtag # at the top of the page.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the city of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, chief of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each bone, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "live with drug trafficking)" which is meant to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were in the battle between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime lets us fear not only our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For instance, when businesses close, because they are threatened by drug traffickers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video entitled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how afraid lives changes" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and governance." ""</seg>

<seg id="777">KYHB, a lesbian from Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensation journalism for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I come to newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can come from a textbook for criminology or from experts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin will think that he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "hero" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified by the fact that they were" "" "watered" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirred and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months of blackmail in the capital district: how a family with threats was plundered." in this she describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business for month until they had not only destroyed the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you've lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these awful days I wondered if weeping would resolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation drawn by violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and "chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had been over two years earlier when he was just a few blocks away from his home, who saw the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office was 3103 killings. this corresponds to 8,5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," animal PolÃ­tico 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to depict the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades.</seg>
<seg id="816">If a picture is worth a thousand untrue words</seg>
<seg id="817">"sharing is Caring" by Flickr user Niklas WikstrÃ¶m (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNUNG: this post and the pages to which he links, contain images on which violence is represented.</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting a scaffolding or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how about the years after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been misleading to depict tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This incorrect pairing of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant meticulous coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous pathways full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank wagon fell victim to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Authorities described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby which was full of people watching the World Cup World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charted corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned for lack of knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture with the title" "" "This is Nigeria." "" "from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident map out the horrible scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charted bodies that are strung on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was taken up several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters from Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically the atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and corpses were placed in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "nobody stayed back to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch resident." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be depicted figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerian and the attempt of the Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo, as it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, the misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa check has documented regulations on Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example falsely relate the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning message published by the United Nations describes those who were able to flee, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported violence against the Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following, who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news page, which in 2012 claimed that President Myanmar's Thein had said that monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image from the DR Congo to capture this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong issues or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life both are important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">But a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who have accidentally contributed to trashing the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggest this mood of mis- and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and taste the actual horror of what happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent imagery has already been extensively debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that rejecting images of a refusal to acknowledge the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images of readers and viewers are desensitizing and giving them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study that investigates how violent media act on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent depictions in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms in order to support the fight against "fake News." they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used by the context or in a completely misuse way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Andy Simmons uses the CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. unsurpassable) strives to offer speech enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese saudades) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubborn every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find, for example, words from the VAT-clap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Praise your parents in recognition of how they have tried to care for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- the comfort or laziness you feel after being warmed in the sun during the cold days." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other ways of thought and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page even more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are.</seg>

<seg id="972">According to an opinion from the Sri Lanka disaster centre from 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and sludge winches.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe places.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfalls left on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.</seg>

<seg id="1002">I have already managed this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sahar they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims" that have built up in their imagination.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They relied me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We therefore identify ourselves as a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well designed in our collective performance that as soon as Muslims, like I do not fit into it, have to be Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Abdominals are being abused</seg>
<seg id="1011">I am not alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1014">Love?</seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day he died, the center of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western vision the religion of Rumi was erased, as well as the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting accounts for a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another is in the reductionist images of Muslims who have been colonizing Western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This tempting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should be saved.</seg>

<seg id="1025">I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful, erroneous Narratives dominate our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative overshadows the reality of nine Muslim women in the last three decades, while the United States did not even select their first female presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that if French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabian, Muslim women to cover their entire body, these are both sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">"" "a powerful group exerts its" "" "control" "" "to the" "" "other" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong narrative weakens Muslim women who conduct movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Africans who had been brought here with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deep and erroneous, that often Sikh-men and children become the target of anti-fungal attacks and harassment.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the way we talk about it, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the 1.7 billion belong</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>

<seg id="1132">We must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions, consciously and unconsciously to solidify the "other." as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation that we have no president, the chocolate cake, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for storytelling wants to preserve urban linguistic diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the enumeration of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unsurpassed blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of language from major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk is that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often to understand" "" "these events are" "" "listening to" "" "instead" "" "listening to" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers put their history first and foremost in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their presentation lead to the fact that the audience is involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They cry out laughing and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamara tells the Fabel of Rabbit and the Pavian in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his ability, John Nyagara asks: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a broad grin he shares his feeling of exclusivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers are hoping to extend it. anyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story narrative guides.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of re-examining the public debt of Puerto Rico, which totalled 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the March started at the Vatican Capitol, the capital's government building, and went to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juan.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syriac-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is organised in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, managing director of Book Sprints' completed books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Aftermarket).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published last year and is freely available here, contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what is the true cost with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet Volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about its current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own fates, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">"" "his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "" "military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" "" "strictly secret" "" "command of the military court from his cell in Adra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015, she was contacted by people who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his place of residence and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project called Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basque's cultural prototypes was more proactive than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here, Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything in mind, to wipe out this architecture, which is not only embodied in the cultural heritage of Syria, but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and bass taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a trial which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora titled "It happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens during each visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sink into the world of your beautiful eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ourselves,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the dangers doesn't matter to me,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and guards</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prison of prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I'll go into every detail of your voice and words</seg>

<seg id="1237">And I will let another piece of my soul leave with you...</seg>

<seg id="1239">To reclaim all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify to myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the detention of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year goes by, my soul</seg>

<seg id="1250">By 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1253">We reiterate our call today in the hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: back to previous post because of corruption convicted director</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique reacted with anger against a corruption in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence when the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other defendants in 2010 with four other defendants.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public money from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was given by the Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his resetting to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, who rejected the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to return to his old post because the company did not complete any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we are aware of is that even the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the contrary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently held no adequate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "disguised" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been cut off.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director doesn't have any morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insults him. I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morals to return to the state, but it had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead it operated only on the state itself.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zebeet prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remind that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves are part of Samora's prison. not only will the Mozambique Front be remembered as the first independent president, but also as sharp, thoughtful and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, when he vigorously affirmed that "an ambitious person is capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that he is not so. he changes the tactics but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious person is criminal at the same time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions also declined:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison; he was 10 years old and released.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company, in which he misses money, sets him under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - Ñresourceful (@ azmal _ Rafik) 12. may 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censors many users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">"" "the Burmese word" "" "Kalar pae" "" "means" "" "chickpeas" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the known social network took their posts out of the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censors the word "Kalar" or as a part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely abusive connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of useful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">Today 'Kalar' may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several Burmese words with fundamentally different meanings that have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmisch also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spider bse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail from one of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to ease his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The ku la - "cure" (ku) + the question phrase (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook ought to be analytic before it worsens all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook doesn't delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on Faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should be done instead is to carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, get a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who propagate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive by Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from writing, posting and sharing content for 24 hours, because the post "did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their views against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author shared his views on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khins believes that Facebook is supposed to have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censor such words will bring even more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they didn't try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great deal of sales, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">The automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads: "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post states" "" "If you are a doctor, do you then heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should also incite violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine area, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticised for its failure to control the growing hate speech on its Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at context rather than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">In May 2016, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, leader of the Interreligious Organization (IRO), a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, since that is, age does not determine maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN child rights convention, the minors as," "" "defined every person under 18 years" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics by the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who had been married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements aimed at abolishing laws for the child marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly they helped bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no hesitation to say the critics of the child before they were to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really difficult thing, and at some point, doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the draft bill against the child marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and let the law declare." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle once again posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the child marriage was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and no one voted against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws for the child marriage had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who has a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that has concealed the core of the matter, but do you know what? the childrens are now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was the opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentro-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which states: news, news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage network has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, Voices - 35 for it - 0 on the other hand!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Torture Mutota, belonging to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who spoke quite openly about the importance of the adoption of the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage-capable age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation of 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft for the amendment of the married couple was decided today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All MEPs who were opposed have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The child marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...) # childbirth sign abuse.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who fought for him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj announced his intention to take judicial steps, should the law be passed away, and he seems to dissolve his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate if Maharaj wanted to proceed against the law, most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Better Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion in a general way, in a way that can only cause panic and disgrace, if we, instead of talking about the problem that the state, which protects our daughters from being abused, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the children are legal or still the norm in different gradations, although there are laws that they prohibit.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages Turkish users can once again view Wikipedia contents</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, darkened internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has been blocking the popular cyclopedia Wikipedia, based on crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technicached Internet users are used to using wrapping tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was passed.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine computer connections), which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is still available despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (about blocking Wikipedia), we put everything in place to cover snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents on a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopa.org, a MirrorPage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open-source project that everyone can use to host similar murals when banned in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni told Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as employees at mozilla at Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You attack another URL, which is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server continues to guide the query to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A Suhlenose Nashorn, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motives and washed out colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">That motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal to the international scene.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown next to the Chitwan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime location in his work helps him:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was just resting at home when suddenly Navarrese (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the Leopard was and I immediately started to crap pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already facing tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't disturb itself from the opinion of the sheep in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I too was on the way home because of the darkness when the king of the boy suddenly appeared. he sat down immediately, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to make photos of Otters in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalytika and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid speaking with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronouns or say" "" "father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to the social pressure they respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should disregard the norm, maintain this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a false court and rejected by her family and village community after addressing a married relative with his name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also does not name their wives is common among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, played a unique club, thus became the main subject of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal which is run by the Video Volunteers community and campaigned for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">For seven years Rohini Paste has been working with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as child marriage and the exile of HIV and AIDS infected people, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video showing the Rohini in their discussion was by women who don't name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the discussion about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The names of their husbands do not speak loudly, is a custom that they all maintain and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered a deceitful woman, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him now by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion basket.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then they all asked, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they put the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of a centuries-old tradition in which married women should never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she just kicked off during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole frustration against him and his family by cursing it.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenalin rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands on their behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a lot of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in the head of the women: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said:" "" "Rohini meant I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation artete out in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the chin-red dot on the forehead that indicates the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would bear the zinok red dot if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped working completely with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip with each discussion basket." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example, like our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things loudly, no matter how small they happen.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion group, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people it's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salm-Kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers, they didn't dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of the choice of clothing, the morals associated with saris and much more, Rohini smuggled its own pair of Kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion round, so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini are sure they will make it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club, Rohini confirmed that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberrot on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos of stories that are not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1553">It became clear to people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached its zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail store Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of abduction of individuals for organ trafficking, presumably for disbelievers, worries the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">It gives the local superstitions that the head of a man of a bald man could bring gold or bring wealth, explained the police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the UN 2016 to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, particularly in the neighbouring country Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat this superstition and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the city of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who plan to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Respect to kahle men who travel to Mozambique to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks, warned the Mosambique police according to the latest assassinations of three men-headed men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange where the assassinations took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the town of Instabane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the man-headed men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of ZambÃ©zia, has been commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also alludes to the police of the Republic of Mozambique in discord (PRM), which also indicates that a faith existed, according to which the victims in the head might have power that generated riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">On Facebook Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the blogger poor Snaippa, who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty of which Mozambique is facing:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÃCHTE GERNE EIN Mosambique, THE SME ashamed A country in which the people would have shame to go to the streets and would not hurt others or even take their lives to earn their bread, a country in which neither the Albinos nor kahle or bald headed for devout purposes or "black magic" are chased, aiming to gain wealth.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the detained Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years "imprisonment for" Subversion "(state endangerment) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the State Department in China called Lius case as" "" "an internal affair" "" "and says a spokesman, he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to appeal to the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, or to allow him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway Finnmark</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway collapsed, after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only resumed in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The EU's top-class diplomat, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius as announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">We expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They are to meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1652">"" "us Ambassador Terry Branstad told us that the Americans would" "" "wish him the opportunity to treat abroad, in so far as he can help him with his recovery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The invitation of the U.S. embassy attracted a furious response from China, with the utterance of the foreign ministry that "no country has the right to intervene and make irresponsible statements about Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley reported that China ought to offer the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice upon which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Reuters reported that China had great concerns about whether the whirlwind around Liu could overshadow the visit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada Go to the top</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called for China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP before that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release the rights for the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry called for China in an explanation on 29 June to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments that he, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will ultimately receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan Straight</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of Rural Affairs in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Liu and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature of Yu-Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the ailing intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in an explanation on June 28, around Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Lius well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He spoke about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moved and encouraged also when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was supposed to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of meeting the international branch of the Association of Bar Association of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore was to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this precious land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he was defending an idea, according to which one could not measure Singapore's political system with other "normal countries" in the face of it, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core of the topic, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers, pretending democrats to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the responses given last week by Shanmugam were really non-replies to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarred the corresponding questions with non-replies rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, because she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point if he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">While Anon publishes his commentary on the blog, he points to the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is more a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities witnessed a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore" "" "is not a country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - be I with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure whether he really believes it, and is aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review departs the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "committed" "" "a mistake" "" "or was it a spokesman for Freud?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the Cabinet of government, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our Prime Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff certificate?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>

<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I did not say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>

<seg id="1745">For my clarification then usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians may cook with anger, if they are kept for Americans, but I don't mind that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that parodes the Junta, which took power in 2014, and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the rules his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video still refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists told the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has consistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary constitution granting absolute decision-making over important national issues to the commander-in-chief of the Army." ""</seg>

<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was also established in the army, which monitors the online content and persons accused of being slandered by the monarchy is prosecuted.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Two days later, it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the junta is still pursuing is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>

<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Eurasia, Georgians and Armenians were living and working together to Soviet sites in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district has been 16,000 people, having barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989, about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brillar frame and gold-colored earrings in teddy bears.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. however, they know many of the names Mom Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom, there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells, people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on boxes outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them drugs that they can't pay, they massage them with a balm that drew exhausted feet from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Ms RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he responds with a smile." "" "I really feel it suits her, because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and her three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans already speak on Whatsapp by Ms RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms RamÃ­rez in future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he answers, smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they went to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know a lot about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps well known here, but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking station outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela says he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they experience." ""</seg>

<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula, come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single person, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is back with guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors the travellers will consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care, whom she has made an Kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she imagines her briefly.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities area in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, mobile users in the Tianshan district of the city Urumqi received a phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleanup").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app will prevent" "" "preventing access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"" "" "" "but kÃ²nsowy the authorities also use the app for more than combating terrorism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police said that the app would investigate and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, from online scams, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications about digital censorship in China are mostly focused on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south, reality is often a gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often assign extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" (at the top of the page), the censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen checked the residents indiscriminately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, it could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment through the reproduction technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "(at the top of the page) also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system and thus gets unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computer and mobile phones turn into electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="1986">"" "" "" "the rules in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council Council to minimize the spread of illegal contents." ""</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions affiliated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">An up-to-date report from Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi an ordinance with the directive to all residents and contractors to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard disks, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos," but this action violates the Personality Rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a number of other possible offences, including those referring to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emballam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emballam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emballam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he hurls to his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to escape from their village in Palestine in which they lived as felahyees (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind, and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special reluctance against American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, has something to do with his identity as a "Palestinian flown from the second generation," he denotes himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own life circumstances so," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while he shuts NescafÃ© in water in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a senseless hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically speaking, the slipping of lukewarm coffee and the rakes of the Kent-Cigarettes in the nose first of all speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when one looks at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in public during Ramadan to drink water - not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual face-singer Hamed sensuo, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the deputies and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "straight" "" "had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism, which poses the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila underestimated the Jordanian nation as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continues to advocate for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be simple rhetoric, but in fact reflecting a more and more clearly crystallizing reality in Jordan which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib brought traditional gender maids to the body by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently settled woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years, the number of 'Ehrenmorde' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour killings in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still more aggravating that Jordan is missing institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held indefinitely in prison" and for their release, many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee from the family are often required that the woman will not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">Politics was intimidated, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'd ed," Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "", "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"" "in March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled" "" "Santander" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse often repeats:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you, in his words, "get what you want" - whether faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program, Roya, to remember later that his comments were torn out of context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but it was only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance against homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuit, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib is asking himself: if Abu Nudie, who was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices were silenced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service established several former government representatives and members of the teacher's association, with the reason that they have critically commented on the issues raised in social media with the corruption rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural rethink in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denounced Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's how Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a true and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially created democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time comes, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore also resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriors puppets are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the wagons, drums and dancing have been handed over more than one thousand years and come from a time when armies from West Japan marched to the Northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissary, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two forlorries are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and still a breath-taking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outer appearances and body care rarely were as important as in this history, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate job like that of the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to Lima's historic center - a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other medium- and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to becoming more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers that can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the outer limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (other videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressing art, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district, where we are very proud, because from love to the children we built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of Love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important, people who feel empowered to meet affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly what prompted the young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cartas por la RamliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was considered as significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Colombians, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to war rhetoric, and around the clock carried their weapons with them, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now absorb them into their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian convinced that the young Colombians must join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - messages of love to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in February 2017 in BogotÃ¡. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people who needed the most urgent need this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC fighters who now find their place in society and to build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">To date, more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transmit the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were on the way they had done before to receive orders from their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings can be passed in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Camplets" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because beside him on the bed was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I asked him," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer." "" "suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war too, was sorry to be the faithful companion of this fighter all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected something else from life as a war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"" "" "" "until now I have learned only how to deal with weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning, students and some leaders of the FARC were joined by a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as a war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how the social injustice caused by the state to the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who have never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate those with beautiful feelings turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country is living is painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people, including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that after the disarmament of peace there would be peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people ready to resort to arms, to rise and to protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he was a friend, made a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me.</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made the round by WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing some shopping bags from my car back seat, I heard a male voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard one sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "" "how long do you want to dishonour the family, you spot?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up at the hospital in the last analysis.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything and began to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: what ailments have you been placed in - in which the men or women of women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are dated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For this I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I first read his name at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some perfectly unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets; others wanted me to appear on official television in Grozny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad speech and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have cup size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she put a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number sign with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, I realized that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you escape?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering me, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plugged the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I received a message: "you don't think you're in safety just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in what hotel you're in. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements still carry me in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with the camera, I really try to figure out how the person looks at which she reminds herself of her past - that is, my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who has imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan was barely able to wait and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "with that, I mean, they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so-called" "" "honor" "" "has been experienced by blood satisfaction." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: will men still hold gay men in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, above all those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately immersed in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits but there were no reports yet. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"" "do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to so-called" "" "non-traditional" "" "orientation have already happened in the past?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think I was already known in Grozny before 2003 when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally intended to bring us to" "" "civilisation" "", "but ultimately rejected us in the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored lashes, wearing reddish jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never even curved a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Don't talk about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they make fun of sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never offended me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: until Kadyrov came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but above all about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who were laughing and laughing at first looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the meantime, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activities are you going on now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreps, meetings, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no penny for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people themselves when I abaped influxes.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddendrop?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to make you white with foam before the mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the Dagestana have what the cabardines have, the Russians also have what; on the whole planet they exist - but" "" "not in Chechnya." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think at transition to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be exact, different attitudes.</seg>
<seg id="2391">It is the most important thing for me to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will become so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Awaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For the past few months there has been a sharp rise in suicide.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 pushed the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is characterised by poverty and unemployment, in the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the incineration was so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have caught up.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all the family fathers who felt helpless because of persecution from the Iranian government, helpless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population gets little from that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime has systematically denied the Ahwazi-Arabs workplaces in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large number of dams, the water from the Arabic regions to the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to devastation caused by dryness in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi adolescents now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general manager for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed the primary school, completed 55% a secondary school, and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist resident in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers, the local Arabic ancestor is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national Resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arabic names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement authored by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminine in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, nowadays, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women meet a glass ceiling earlier or later in diverse areas of life, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalised form of racist motivational violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to the school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women to have all men and all men of any skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join myself as a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to take account of injustices in her thinking, which refer to the sex as well as the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a humanly and marginalised being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to explain white women the importance of the overlapping of skin color and sex. because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to reward them for a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different backgrounds a home and isolate themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of feminism completely and to join the movement of Womanism, which has been called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming, says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, emotional, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call for separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life is neither bypassed nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child," Musa tells.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the world fear that decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterberg - a subsidiary of Waterkeepers Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources. "</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by Kursaal. the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# softly einclustered), which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had become violent vis-Ã -vis her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has gone by and the police said that their statement would be put to the acts, but more cannot be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman presented Balbuena because of abuse, Ada BÃ¡ez also noted the actentious display of Ada BÃ¡ez.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman retired her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When women permit an ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit to be victims of violence, are in fact reported to the law enforcement authorities.</seg>

<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney General filed 9600 ads for domestic violence. at 70% of them, it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were over 5000 ads of domestic violence in the courts of peace. here, too, 86% of women's ads came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women reported that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics however do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay due to psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>

<seg id="2499">Because women's murder in Paraguay is not a private criminal, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists included at least 12 cases of suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she inherited the psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happened to women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about maltreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming a name, she posted posts on Facebook where she described her insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorical if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity in it.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Figure takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for exploring these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping establish own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Central Laboratory at the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s, he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he explored the HIV virus himself before deciding to go home to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>

<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being a maker yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work that you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how large is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research on space, health care (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed, things to do, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines can only be made available against payment (the so-called Paywall) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky first appeared on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by its own ingenuity and the question of how many types of salad he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only suitable for individual types, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cartels. because of this trend plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food safety for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still breeding salad, but it takes longer, as his work becomes more and more difficult due to increasing restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if in a river there is a boulder around which I must spin." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go far too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new salad sort, because all the features have already been patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavours to use no material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">"" "astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have cultured and eaten red tube salat of the" "" "glasshouse" "" "of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space." ""</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source seed initiative (initiative for open-source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus are permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit that other seed-bred seeds can be freely used by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they will not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others to cross their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately hiring them - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to seed, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg emphasises that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement does not work with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patched, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says, taking into account the increasingly frequent mergers in the global agriculture industry, as it is offered for example on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool shrinks continually due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights available on plant material.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all cartel features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be usable either at all or difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salads or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted characteristics - such by which their taste or color improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders decreases by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predictive due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an email, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and co-operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the view that intellectual property includes other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing the public with more material and expertise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you need to wait so long to grow crops that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight already.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain: "independent plant breeders do not have time or money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to facilitate farmers their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we can't continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plant characteristics: "we do not really create the characteristics ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state of Oregon and Ossi, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who breeds a variety, breeds its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for their cultivation require massive herbicides, which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto), most smaller seed companies manage to survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In addition, Morton believes breeders should be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I'm using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties within a few years, "he says." with a patent, one is protected from competition for 20 years, which makes it very easy in my opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, carries out an open-source seed program. to preserve the seed of traditional crop varieties, the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>

<seg id="2686">"" "the German organization Agrecol is working on an" "" "open-source" "" "license, which ultimately forms a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi-obligation for breeders in the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, because the Ossi obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's "Open Source" seed systems, states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open-source seed systems for which the official starting signal should be launched next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">An association from environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report. it believes that farmers must have the opportunity to come to seeds, exchange it and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest censorship goals in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 05.August the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents and reports human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities for this step sharply criticized and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remained loyal to its goal to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, to expose the freedom of opinion and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network originating from Qatar due to alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of site blocks to the victim. @ anhri one of the main sources of data for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of Columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt non-accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship apparatus of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider in which also Zionists blog is located, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, when he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blockade by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfatwa al-Sisi; and even though the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a siege, an arrest, an attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now after they have locked him and that they are scared of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous will walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of vendors, through the circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">She reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicate the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that could have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In addition, the situation is worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which it can proceed against these actions in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants dispute.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian Army was deployed in the favelas in NiterÃ³i, a town in Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos PÃºblicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in the whole of Brazil report headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard designs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot at school," "" "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "" "thieves robbing pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airwaves to Rio." ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio in 2017 for 10 years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "in this way, the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "known for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio published the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which it announced a new column called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. anything that deviates from civilised standards and what happens only in Rio, is published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: it is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial the paper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to hide the atrocities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "is the term" "" "war" "" "more than it benefits?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira is arguing against the violence as "war." in her opinion this is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible persons in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">As a reminder, the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"" "according to the statistics of 2015, Rio de Janeiro as" "" "the most violent place in Brazil" "" "is wrong:" "" "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most recent available data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the mores per state, Rio is ranked 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra is owned by Globo, the largest media company of South America, which, like CecÃ­lia, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures also included the creation of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by Rio de Janeiro in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police pot and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline in violent deaths. for some years, however, the UPP has increasingly been bombarded by harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles in 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this demands the state to use means and ways typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civil war is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio are still suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police klomm the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Worldwatch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PAX and the Research Institute, The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region east of Ghouta, where chemical weapons attack on August 21, 2013, demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been under siege from Damascus, which led to the need for local residents to be smuggled on local or through tunnels and checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teach Eastern Ghoutas inhabitants as they can plant their own fungi as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive food source for many local residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directorate of the project, Abo Nabil, spoke to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">"" "Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that it has been fighting for three years to announce this project and express its relief that it is now becoming more and more popular." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">To raise funds for the initiative, in consultation with the NGO Ghira Alnahda, we use the humanitarian crowd funding platform CanDo.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of planting mushrooms, so Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo by Monday, 4 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortages, locally produced plastics are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila told Global Voices that they started with" "" "production from the regions originating from the regions" "" "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese are calling for justice for the victims of the 2017 's</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the week before in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the last week of solidarity with victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in Galicia in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 explosions, spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy happened in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon area.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there are only 4 districts no fire.</seg>

<seg id="2846">People wondered why civilians were unable to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Soveral of the Federation of Farmers of Portugal explained the paper PÃºblico:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After PedrÃ³gÃ£o there were roads and villages for everything and nothing evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this anywhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June, as the streets were closed very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the form of forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"" "" "" "the government carried out a loosening of the law that allowed construction activity if the applicant had funds for self-defence - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," "" "JoÃ£o Sorval resumed in the same article from the newspaper PÃºblico." ""</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees of readily combustible wood, like in a vicious circle, always extend to fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when citizens sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that supplied the population with information: it used the own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the servers stopped the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million accesses.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family during dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother did not say that at that time, she knew she would not see her son much longer - maybe never again.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy was supposed to break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hasan-dominated party, Hezb-e-Wahdat, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred on the Hazara, have come closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sackcloth with mortars, which were heavier than himself, in order to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really tough," "" "Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharpen came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">For some time, Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid in need twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "" "" "it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high incidence rates. it is also true that the conditions found in the country are disastrous." ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system suffers from a general lack of transparency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3,000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unimaginable personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially submit an application for asylum - which can be drawn after the registration of the asylum application for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who do not have money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Asharpen put all his savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes, and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the Afghans have emerged, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Peace & amp restaurant in Padua, Spice and also behind the Kabulogna Pizzeria and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs's objectives extend far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and the retail sector, and return to the country, which he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where a risk is, there are also opportunities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily, if I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent the half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also forges plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and canning techniques." "" "so they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharpen has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearance of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the release of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocations's Needs Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register to use social networks within six months of submitting their full name as well as their ID number within six months of the authority's website.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the final payment of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which has been promoted by sixty members of Parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "another MP submitted a legislative proposal in which harsher penalties for the insult of the President or a high officials would be introduced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">"" "" "" "under the law, such a deed would be punished with prison and fines, legal experts from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has already been in danger for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who fought against the military coup that led to the deportation of elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Like more than 700 protesters who had been arrested in the same incident, Shawkan was waiting for four years in prison for a trial.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed until May 20, because the prison administration, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, including false charges of amongst others weapons collection, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza was acquitted by two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of the pro-Morsi seat block at the Raba'a Al-Adaviya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishment of the journalist Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists listen to screened documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was principally interrogated to a severed action plan. said plan was provided by the President of the Republic who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial bill that would ensure businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided they return all unlawfully received funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April at Nawaat's website sheds light on how the President's plans for the support of the legislation look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused to mention his sources, stating Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which journalists have the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to demonstrate their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new rules of the information bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require permission before writing or sharing news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In addition, it is stated in the rules that registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts believe that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks. it is unclear how the authorities will use these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only selectively enforce these regulations in order to protect the citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we then see ourselves in "WeChat?"</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Messaging App WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat obstructed the registration of the state government as" "" "organiser of the distribution of information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 Act, thanks to which the Russian Government performs a list of online services that organize the "publication of the information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for the removal of content and to force them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites like Vkontakte and Odnoessniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish Court features lock Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the blocking Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the data that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was closed because it was" "" "a source of information that collaborates with groups to promote a political defamation campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey completely blocks the website. it is thus, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain cannot stop to sniff around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government finds itself in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real-time and install Backdoor-Programs that encrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
