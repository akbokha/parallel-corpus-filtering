that is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA has heard illeg@@ ally tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA gave literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government decided against Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and scor@@ ing journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous that they offer .
so when the government kno@@ cked on Ris@@ en , he did what many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they stated for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government of Ris@@ en were dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , re@@ porters and sources can always hide less and less .
instead of failure and ris@@ king to make statements , that could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly ap@@ pre@@ h@@ ended his phone calls , &quot; &quot; &quot;
as well as its email data , financial and bank information , its loan agreement , and even travel tips with the list of its flights .
amid this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower in his attempt to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 almost every article about national security was the result of a whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional review , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software , which has not yet been written when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source trans@@ mitting system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower developed by Aaron Swar@@ tz , which was originally developed by us , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload or send documents , as with any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information in secret , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology men like Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to show mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows about ab@@ uses in the care of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker who strikes alarm for the poll@@ uted water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 &#91; the Panama Papers &#93; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were sent from news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents provides a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ head firms in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of US $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous about the next release , and the next documents revealed .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent @-@ collector or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems to be away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this be done ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used by a few to hide and obsc@@ ure their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very confusing all over the world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports in the US on this matter .
presumably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who came to this sc@@ andal in these revelations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but through the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have ties to the US .
in fact , in some US states there is less information needed to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip particularly suscep@@ tible investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked all of us to make suggestions for a lawyer to transfer his money to our investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound very dull , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I really see that things have begun to change .
in the last few years we have seen violations of more transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been gathering in central registers at the national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind here .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy who get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end through laws this way of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after finishing my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it got late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he &apos;d go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
then I heard me saying , &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , embarrass@@ ed at the tips of the door and shut down my bedroom door .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in my childhood were actually friends who only waited for them to be discovered ?
being on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate runs out and the rent is increased .
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment is a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it .
thus we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors one closes when visiting .
over the Internet they can then invite other people to stay overnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you should focus on things you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of which degree of trust we asp@@ ire .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left .
this quietly p@@ ani@@ cking of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
in this way , most guests feel like staying somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like that , who now has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the President &apos;s Office ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I &apos;d like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name ; if he had told how he came from , how his dog or his children were called ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine you would have 150 testim@@ oni@@ als , who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he can really handle very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel if you had to hand over your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their jud@@ gements before we placed them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence .
it is little surprising that we trust the most similar to the people who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by app@@ rais@@ als .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stems from common ground .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted love .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request will not be accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimum level of openness , such as &quot; Great art@@ works in your apartment ! &quot; I &apos;m doing a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can it be created with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to leave these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a demand that had not been covered beforehand .
for us , the business is running very well .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who were not allowed parties to celebrate or rav@@ age homes .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for men are right to trust one another .
if trust works , there can be wonderful results .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who are inclined to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know them properly .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital where you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books by .
they can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay is running .
but these relationships behind pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
this is an economic trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now simply calling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people open a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
if you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place that one visited , a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show one at a tavern tour of which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn how to cook a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to each other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of sharing a shared part ?
I imagine cities which allow us society and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and isolation .
this project was already started in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul . many car parks belonging to the government ,
were offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were im@@ par@@ ted to people whose children were withdrawn .
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality also existed before .
there have been similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from luck and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the check @-@ in at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ annab@@ e @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ osexual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was that at that time it was a feminist Declaration of In@@ dependence , compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and finally believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confident and slow , which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands and yet loves somehow ?
that is how it feels .
later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock turned quickly into indignation .
why should we do something like this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned into a susp@@ ects from a citizen .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move to a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I went sil@@ ently -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cau@@ ti@@ ously &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remain in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ sam@@ pled not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings were : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who were held for Muslims in the Free Zone and beat them .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I don &apos;t have anything against any questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we get rid of them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and include mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as from a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , not a tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic Games .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
maybe a few parking places will be released , but do not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people of other faith more tolerant and to show greater citizen participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of radi@@ cal@@ isation it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even by their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or fallen from faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we need to stop people going to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that makes them read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister , with whom she spoke , sil@@ enced her and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization through extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and His church .
instead of acc@@ using her for anger , he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque was preventing her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian regime of government , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that if you submit to test persons messages in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they agree with military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims was sho@@ cking up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public in order to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
when it comes to the allocation of collective debt , it is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athlete .
he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did such a young man become an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had come to visit in the afternoon .
he laughs at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America would like to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we decided to go to the mosque .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , drew my shoes , went to the building of prayer , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the meeting were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had advanced courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who may claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with depth , working in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be deceived . I am totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people like an exception appear to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a million@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air packages penet@@ rated into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks . a few years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting flight devices , high speed and acceleration are reached in the tigh@@ test space .
they can also build up @-@ to @-@ themselves pull @-@ out structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter ,
a plane trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star @-@ runners , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most star @-@ wing fl@@ yers it can float , and thus has great advantages in start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often ask for basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that gather to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote operated flight unit . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , one prop@@ eller ,
no cl@@ amps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is quite simple , there is a lot happening inside the interior , so that it can fly in a stable way and move in the room everywhere .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right properly .
the likel@@ ihood of getting it right , if all watch it , is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video filmed yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in indul@@ gence , this machine here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , is an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore , he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
this gives him the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions no matter in which direction it is turned or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate twin prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery - the machine can continue flying even if limited .
we will now demonstrate this by making half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression .
we took commercially available micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully , these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for guys like us , wages are in development and creative act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very distant gal@@ axy , so they transformed the mass of three son@@ es into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they lit up bri@@ ghter than all stars along all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time frame itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events in time .
it was 1.3 billion years ago that there was just a few weeks of life on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is standing with us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group decided to build a giant laser detector -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves resulting from col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ er- Gra@@ vity Wave Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of lig@@ o was considerably increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was started for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes were scre@@ ened through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my father to death .
basically , that was the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist on MIT . he investig@@ ates gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and her by observ@@ atories like lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cr@@ ushing in the structure of space and time .
when passing the wave , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and st@@ out into the other .
for illustration , teachers in courses on rel@@ ativity theory often lead to a really foolish dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and st@@ ow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous , are .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and stressed when the waves hit the waves . the stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this is called 20 zer@@ os according to the comm@@ a , followed by 1 . that is why the Lig@@ o employees declared mad .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucleus . this is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by using the light coming from several points around you .
this is different when it comes to sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you :
for example the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make any simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can hear the universe literally .
to listen to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott is already busy very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very fast , you hear the same p@@ ant@@ y with an additional key change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , engraved in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date , which at least I will never forget -- heard this as sound -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : let &apos;s consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ves around one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
therein lies the lasting significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the un@@ seen .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through because these are op@@ aque .
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is obs@@ cured by its own light @-@ light .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that all things exist that we have never seen , which we will never see , and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the no@@ od@@ les for our arch@@ eological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on what happened in space , the emergence of the stars , and ultimately , how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it anno@@ yed me , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to begin with the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , eliminated my fear .
my fear of holding speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a certain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected way . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , is called all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak @-@ cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
from there , I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I do , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; -@@ say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things look good , aw@@ aken to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for putting out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes simultaneously in production , four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : show To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
$ 350 million for a season .
in America , my television series are running one another on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I created myself , and not just produced . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who else does this ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you are managing a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a budget , take me seriously when I speak of work so you understand that I am not just hanging around the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I don &apos;t understand that it &apos;s going to dream with a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops , as I painted on a screen .
so as if you were wearing a high tone , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when working well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people assume , when I explain to them the tot@@ em that I am talking about writing that writing is a joy for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sums -- when I began to work and work and make , create , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy .
the tot@@ em is more than writing .
the tot@@ um is action and activity . the tot@@ um is a drug .
the tot@@ um is music . the tot@@ um is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , you can &apos;t strive for size differently .
the feeling of being no different than striving for size doesn &apos;t matter at what price .
this is called the sum .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the hum@@ ming .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more work there is , the more things are watching me , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the tot@@ um , the tot@@ um , the tot@@ um .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the tot@@ um .
I need the hum@@ ming . I am the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the tot@@ um stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , over@@ stated , burned out .
the tot@@ um stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single work institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write my anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ mons ceased .
the hum@@ ming of the engine stopped .
I did not love my work any more . the engine was off .
the tot@@ um did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the tot@@ um I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly fa@@ des ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how@@ l , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do , you do , you do , you love what you do to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the sums , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way outside , late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she no longer calls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happened ?
I miss it when I am Titan and my bu@@ zz be@@ ers , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of breathing , I can do nothing except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ ps and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl dies in &quot; Die Eis@@ köni@@ gin . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
and not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming slowly comes back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the hum@@ ming , but a hum@@ ming .
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the working sums , the Tit@@ an@@ en@@ sums , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself through broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the tot@@ um is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real tot@@ em depends on the love .
the tot@@ um is the stream coming from the lust of life .
the real tot@@ um is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real tot@@ em ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real sum@@ mons is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can get rid of any debt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not as easy as working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at work than at home .
this admission is painful , for what a person prefers to be than being home ?
well , I am .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we walk around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst as@@ ap bubbles .
I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing with the game ?
you can also ! tell them Yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and speak my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , there is no need .
everyone can get up for 15 minutes , even at a bad mood day !
15 minutes a bit !
no cell phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children get ready .
but 15 minutes are in !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is important to feel the tot@@ um , to have a place for his peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your children . it &apos;s all about fun ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
allow yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what &apos;s doing well .
find out and maintain it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll fail and I &apos;ll be victorious . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a bit , why not treat yourself in 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz@@ ing but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the tot@@ um is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my tot@@ um .
the hum@@ ming of life .
the tot@@ em of love .
the sum of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s sn@@ u@@ ff to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , who plays a journey to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the luck@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I created , the marathon I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the other , the right sums : the tot@@ em of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , consistent , naked and new attitude towards life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel that sums , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things look good , I aw@@ aken you to life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a physician who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
they certainly have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one implant an electrode deep in the brain to influence neur@@ ons in such a way that the neurological function is improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe tre@@ mor and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull trauma .
they must imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas the brain is sw@@ inging and cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save lives , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes you have to remove some s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
being able to grow cells from one tissue is comparable to quite small children that are taken out of their families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve them .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François made it .
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ phar@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the fet@@ us stage , they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear , however , -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic sphere and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did by Jean @-@ François .
and then mark them color @-@ colored to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we moved on to the decision @-@ making ritual of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we spread these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we spread the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and spread exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have become irrit@@ ated .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we coloured in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they made them very good .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we hurt the motor motor area in the motor cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate to some degree , just like monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left hand side you see the monkey who spontaneously re@@ stores .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now look when we planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate them in humans .
I really hope to show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can need that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely do .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this type of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply it to a multi@@ centre study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting us with TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as an imm@@ utable fact .
we believe capitalism is inevitably leading to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proved dou@@ bt@@ lessly that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is f@@ ading with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that have been realized in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my bud@@ dy friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for a real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group will succ@@ um@@ b to wrong belief , we could save our democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy our societies are temper@@ ed , our future is dark , and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the issue of waste I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which is currently under threat to our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin @-@ summit parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that casts its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt hill ,
but only a few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which is part of the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , but they are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and income , with which it could be productive and can produce all the things humanity desper@@ ately needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , in the US , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar sounds after a lot of money until it compar@@ es it to the 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and in our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing , except infl@@ ating stock exchanges and raising the real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin @-@ tops , which do not equ@@ alize through the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand which , as in a final loop , supports the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors who , in fear , the prophecy of the ey@@ epi@@ ece , could be true that his son would kill him if he grows up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances cause ede@@ ma to kill him .
this is my stri@@ fe with capitalism --
his very wast@@ eful article All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents , and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the open and the poor as a majority control the government .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many .
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
but it would be a mistake to mitig@@ ate the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive point in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the toil@@ ing poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political co@@ determination with equal voting in questions of the state of the state .
ath@@ en@@ ic democracy has not kept for a long time --
like a candle that g@@ lows very bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burned out .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- the world of the corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two takes place , while the economy gradually mig@@ rates politics and escap@@ es them .
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because you can be in the government these days , and yet not in power , because the power has mig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separate .
I mentioned my stri@@ fe with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ate the animals they feed on , that they are star@@ ving at the end therefore .
it is similar to the economy that has can@@ ni@@ zed politics so far that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , inequality rises , the overall economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ cra@@ cies &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin Summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by sub@@ stit@@ uting low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste lime , and the social conflicts lower , just like I believe -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we need to resh@@ ape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re @-@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appear as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ic , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines are used to serve human beings , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life .
I think we may be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like Utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ic ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in the near future .
in the area of companies : ask a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and from redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , to whom the company does not belong . no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin @-@ tops .
in the sphere of global political economy , please introduce yourselves briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all of humanity .
keep in mind that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; into units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe is at the same time liber@@ ating , in which it fav@@ ours privileged persons , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage dump of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or are we going to sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ic ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically together .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I &apos;ve just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as a &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are currently experiencing , it will dest@@ abili@@ ze not only our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is minimal .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am totally confused .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t mess , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers have told you very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in some ways , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what can be observed in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , huge after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appointing , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say good @-@ bye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continual denial that a massive de@@ fle@@ ction line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal , which by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this denial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , still chose the denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what are the changes ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : do you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for pro@@ long@@ ation of the debt recovery program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of the financi@@ ers to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that passed through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one from the Troika of the credi@@ tors who imposed this policy on us : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if they do not survive , the un@@ released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 which appears to me , it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we sincer@@ ely hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel hair@@ style and describes itself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right corner of this curve .
this curve is the review distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating .
if your show is rated with nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to subject &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle suspen@@ se , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where everyone can watch it for free .
and if Amazon comes out for nothing , is it right to do it right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you collect when you start the show when you pause , what parts you jump over or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process it and this results in the answer , and it reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 - thus something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time another company has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design by Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the available data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give to the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they went a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but to make a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
you have two very competitive , data @-@ sav@@ vy companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , then you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
it is optimized through very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a little sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company of multi @-@ health systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the US and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ miss@@ al occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . it is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most accomplished firms are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis they can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the worse way -- through data analysis of Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly worked no more ,
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flows increasingly into decisions of life -- at work , in legal enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very wise people can take advantage of many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for cancer therapy .
over the years I realized several patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
if you ever need to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its components so you can analyse the items ; as a branch , you put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the pieces and then come to a resolution .
for this there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
when there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to compose parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I believe Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and understanding , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . but the decision how to take all these parts together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that didn &apos;t stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this device , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will challenge it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hind@@ sight .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a bit more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
