Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish prison , where young people today are to meet .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where now is excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
hus@@ band@@ men manage the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich is sponsor@@ ing exciting stories .
it &apos;s annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this because the car @-@ Nav@@ i was showing a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but precisely for this reason very enligh@@ tening .
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work which one cannot recognize as such .
in the big picture postcard , more detailed maps , so @-@ called documentary sheets , were incorporated into cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ verwaltung between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first measurement of Bavaria .
your principal : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops mar@@ ched away with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , there were the present @-@ day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph continued the project , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ verwaltung ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original document for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of early / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was made 21 years after drawing up the map , so in 18@@ 77 , in the Munich subur@@ b .
today lies Unter@@ send@@ ling in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 alongside today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is today , there is nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ ur@@ ry from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ sus &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small par@@ c@@ els now show no farmers there - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the site of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the guest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the height &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once locked people with del@@ usion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich circle @-@ asylum company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he for@@ bi@@ ds the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients first place was , later on 500 places were expanded .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar , 1905 .
since 2006 , Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um , Munich @-@ Ost , is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts .
the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt is now meeting young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities .
to the west lies the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was erected in an architectural resem@@ b@@ lance to the origins of the Ir@@ ren@@ um , which had been destroyed during the Second World War with bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn race track .
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
Om@@ bud@@ sman publishes Travel Noti@@ ce for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ es has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for special attention to Af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i , since a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur in the whole state and be noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in the group &apos;s opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted law by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the state &apos;s law enforcement authorities who are dispro@@ portion@@ ate to minorities , the group decided to issue the warning , &quot; said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that people pass through . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in which it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state will hold 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be prepared to bring money or let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI @-@ hate crime series , which classi@@ fies the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had adopted immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing according to AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Chil@@ ean fence project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac &apos;s CD@@ U members have taken a picture on the spot .
in the District Court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U village association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially provided insight into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens provided and housed in five apartments holiday guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste is exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also the Chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamental importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t work profit@@ ably on such steep surfaces .
the grass@@ land area care for a lot of work , much must be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not perform a biogas plant .
for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leaders &quot; support . &quot;
the farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ est@@ ation of the land could be dra@@ gged out quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they can continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of the support
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced .
the open @-@ up area is 40 hectares , which cannot be fortified up to 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of them were promoted via leader , one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischer@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ gevity of f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and rural women it doesn &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiss was firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape care gui@@ deline ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art convey@@ ance of wheat f@@ ences .
the goal is to disclose the Black Forest .
the condition is the presence of a conveyor belt designated by the L@@ PR .
moreover , the fenced area must not be smu@@ g@@ gled ( han@@ ger climb above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ est@@ ation .
for the Fischer@@ bacher Chil@@ dec@@ aun@@ ching project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the open @-@ plan area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but it attacked its meaning , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to , as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta recently compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem which you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance on the beg@@ ging words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses , who long to breathe freely , / the miserable falling of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time in which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable tr@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mps USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus and her friends , who sat down to place their words at the base after their death , knew very well that they took up a highly political action .
the sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical illustration .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she herself has a completely different name : mother of Ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued that the Statue of Liberty didn &apos;t invite anybody , but rather an early neo@@ conservative who will bring the American flame into the world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is rather unusual here .
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen from the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever acknowledge .
their torch should not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK Team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the Great Britain team
the performance director of the United Kingdom Ath@@ le@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special is developing in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the corner of the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m route while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team for team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their talk was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les at their fifth world championships , says it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ ir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; route leads along this path and last year has set five British and two European records . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman who was to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games after a great season .
Do@@ yle re@@ members their first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell was .
the team captain says they are &quot; immen@@ sely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also will be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; being a special team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to get up on po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this back @-@ up support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it &apos;ll just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the pre@@ heating of elec@@ tors
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the papers beat him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked on the cri@@ tique , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union was acc@@ using it at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very clever to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hair@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side is a public forum known as officially and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who swing in the whi@@ p online .
the mail spoke to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not profound .
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans of Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani von Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not filled with water , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t really appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the Gover@@ nor referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous times when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical control items or to arrest demonstr@@ ators and to silence them .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is su@@ ed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County fin@@ alized the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she appointed a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck their lead .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , were overwhel@@ med by the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led to the final round next door next door to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job as he established this place .
he is an eager advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to his home base .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about the way it has gone so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of their passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 pulmon@@ ary cancer deaths can be attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ ing@@ street are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in the time , &quot; says the head of the building Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than presum@@ ed , as there is a lot of snow in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic that hin@@ ders construction work is a major problem for the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists from red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the public buses are allowed for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days have been very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ arot@@ ali , the capital of the P@@ ani@@ ai reg@@ ent in the rest@@ less Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the nod@@ ules are stu@@ ffed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work such as washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course late work can be dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders should vote for a public raising in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers from it .
in 2003 the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , and the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprised the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transport .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated sheets that have been transformed by rust into various yel@@ low@@ ish tones .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we weren &apos;t used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold@@ mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port owned $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Papua has wood resources valued at estimated 78 billion US dollars .
but these riches are a source of misery for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
pap@@ al demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 were killed and thousands were rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide in accordance with the Asia Convention on Human Rights .
last year alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful prot@@ esters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we commerci@@ alise all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ es cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , served a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old P@@ ani@@ ai local , who moved to the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama from Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ o , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua during his campaign 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including P@@ ani@@ ai - on the way to the Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , only two months after Jok@@ o &apos;s inauguration , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered a low point in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ arot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers jour@@ ne@@ yed through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their spot@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took offen@@ se at their sound and later came back with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their rif@@ le @-@ bul@@ bs , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was struck so severely that he fell into coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - running in a circle and im@@ itating a bird song - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; they say in an official document of TI@@ ME which has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ arot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for rest and called the crowd to return home .
nobody was able to listen in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans had only one name , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station only because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua @-@ Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings was first filtered on the following day after Jak@@ arta .
three weeks ago , Jok@@ ov@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate talk in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for laying historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses almost immediately began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , who accused the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been buried in Papua , including the P@@ ani@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fi@@ erc@@ ely un@@ believers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am tired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus reiter@@ ated that people in P@@ ani@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the corp@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police shot on villa@@ gers in P@@ ani@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others died , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ g , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s s@@ iting office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing a warning .
but natives say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting down the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to hold the officers accoun@@ table and withdraw the police bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ani@@ ai was always a troub@@ le@@ maker for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the West by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indon@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from P@@ ani@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in P@@ ani@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily detained in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people in Papua , P@@ ani@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ arot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , each with four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native of Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the hub of Nab@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own businesses .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Tribal Council of P@@ ani@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ da and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s electoral campaign were not realized in order to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western pap@@ ua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Foreign Ministry , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the alle@@ gations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence for human rights ab@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also took part in the session but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has yet another presidential election in 2019 , but the state must say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , chairman of the tribal council .
he wants that Jok@@ ov@@ i knows that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , apart from being living under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice to Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the P@@ ani@@ ai villa@@ gers carried out a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of an victim was buried in one area just opposite the police and the military station .
they know they may never give justice to them , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire , which has been swept through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which one coinci@@ dentally calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor down@@ wards , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name to be George , Reu@@ ters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units fired the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions on the safety of materials used in the outside areas of high @-@ rises all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damages from facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation came .
in Britain , the police said that the system of panels for isolation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with his large Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this Sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single was only supported on two winners , thin@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the five @-@ set classics , which are often very long , but also therefore highly valued five @-@ set classics , are thus preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore just missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
not until the vote had come after many in@@ consisten@@ cies before the proposal reached the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : in future , the fin@@ alists will have the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next round in the first round .
in order to reduce the cost of the Organ@@ izer , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden items to the aircraft , find a survey
a survey conducted by air passengers showed that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ate or un@@ consciously banned items were smu@@ g@@ gled to the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while they acci@@ dentally wore acci@@ dentally knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they had discovered that they had gone ast@@ ray with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey was conducted at over 1,000 people , which was carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers were more likely to dis@@ regard the rules .
of those sur@@ vey@@ ed that they unknow@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were .
the most common objects intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said to have deliberately carried objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents confirmed that they had intentionally brought banned drugs into the plane .
the company said it had consul@@ ted travelers across the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently had smu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and how many had deliberately done it .
it is no surprise that the people who were most smu@@ g@@ gled - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who were the most frequent fly .
the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden fluids .

El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
Elektro @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k are happy to announce the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
he has so far been suggest@@ ing that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their non@@ committ@@ al reservation .
in addition to the ever @-@ trium@@ ph@@ al figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k revealed another less da@@ zz@@ ling number for the first time in the announcement of the recent quarterly report : the cancell@@ ations made at the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k had often adverti@@ sed over 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery was just beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now Mus@@ k said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics have always pointed out that it is only non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation Pay@@ ments . &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations took place in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 cars .
in 2018 , all models will be assembled - 500@@ ,000 will be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 bookings are made per day .
if you order today a Model 3 , you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la is able to drive its brand @-@ new , never @-@ tested production lines with maximum utilisation in practice .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to major delays , then the non@@ committ@@ ment of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ cont@@ ented customers from running in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt moves back because of the reluct@@ ance of the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the governmental environment authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a deadline that ran for States on 1 October to meet the 2015 standards for down @-@ to @-@ earth o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfere in local decisions or im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp was a prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulation that resist@@ ed the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ sion regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement issued on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply boo@@ sts the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines for implementation , and then waited to set up an appointment for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt eventually will use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on sound policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive revision of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet to be voted in the Senate .
the New York @-@ based At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States , who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intends to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ v@@ anian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when contam@@ in@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the emerging smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contributes to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ ten &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological dead@@ lock of the Tru@@ mp government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche , a Ser@@ en@@ ade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16th , at 4 : 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of Tum@@ bling to their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village treasure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Provin@@ cial Register : &quot; count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church at the Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the document according to the deed , on the Hill of Tum@@ lingen other than the former parish church there was also a magnificent courtyard , which belonged to the church or the patron law , and not the other way round .
there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still recognizable in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; the third , the wonderful sett@@ ler @-@ core of the village .
old maps of the period around the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the patron of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval self @-@ church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied it with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this church .
this was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two sh@@ rou@@ ded at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were cut and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ lingen Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the steep@@ le was left .
in the New Year &apos;s night in 18@@ 34 a storm split the steep@@ le and half r@@ ushed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the present @-@ day tower remained as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em cultivate the Hil@@ arius facility by Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
the organizers invite friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ bling on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth seren@@ ade to the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler High School Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &apos;s local stand speaks the final word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
to the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers take a fantastic view .
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers look forward to many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of great importance for tum@@ ors and audi@@ ob@@ lets .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ bling feel particularly committed to their home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to test the approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at all , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal , a wind power concentration zone existed .
construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible within this concentration zone , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are intended to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had already decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette only a few days before , but this was not approved by the Düsseldorf district government because of a fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning permission , the granted permission is still illegal and therefore also to take back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break the municipal coun@@ cill@@ or once again decided to open the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind energy plants is excluded from planning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle makes it the cause of re@@ viewing the matter again .
however , they do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to express itself in regards to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette to build four wind turbines , each 200 metres high .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - that is equivalent to roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .
the NEW Re plans to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in death .
two more people were easily injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch entered the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her passenger car as part of the accompanying driving with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother .
city and tra@@ der planning &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ thal and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract the inhabitants for shopping in the city centre .
as the Chairman of the Gewerbe@@ verein , Christian König , announced that the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers their own city provides away from the usual supermarket product .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in addition , local firms should present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , so Christian König .
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this means that the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive City Centre &quot; project .
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; active day &quot; for well @-@ being and sal@@ v@@ aged Sunday , conversations with all the trade @-@ owners and hosts , in order to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials are to be re @-@ opened again or again .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city centre when shopping at a glance .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city centre - to the land@@ lords , the factories all over the city and clubs .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that made itself part of it , and the king had said in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , informed that Germany &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time , is participating in five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adverti@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchasing behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new further people were injured .
in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine more injured , some of them heavy .
according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade there was an injury in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) .
a man died when part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing was later found dead .
at the dead , they were employees of the school .
in the case of an accident , the authorities assumed work on a gas pipeline .
during the holiday period only a few people stayed in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
Tru@@ mp continued after scann@@ ed tran@@ scripts from phone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of phone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tru@@ mp requested a phone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US president was acc@@ using him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to report he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and caught the Ford Bridge from Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with rif@@ les to block their way .
the leader of mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train to his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ mates flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this --@@ -- R Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams broke the silence when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat .
fortunately this horrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of them met very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , citizens of Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge have come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been ly@@ n@@ ched by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ comprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps the organisation of the post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a lifetime civil law .
for him , it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must preserve justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot attain healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician places a sheet over the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on 27 July 1946 .
according to FBI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but no one was ever indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects remain free on foot for decades , citizens rights activists say that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer elections .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black paint shop Roger Mal@@ com met a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to release Mal@@ com from prison , the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they went away from prison and approached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b cir@@ cl@@ ed the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , dispos@@ ed of evi@@ dences and fal@@ si@@ fied the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a rage massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself register and if you vote then this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even harder to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that it &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness of all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ coordinated view of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the ester scre@@ aming and beg@@ ging him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He , van@@ ishing from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ cona answers the fire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ cking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are cries , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman who is suffering from grief is over the corp@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ning praise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the street .
they have experienced Georgia &apos;s oppres@@ sive humidity for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies .
children sit at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch@@ rope and wipe their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms weeping , the emotional burden of performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience went together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta talks about the im@@ position with a black couple that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought to find words that felt the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and do this because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court at his table , he eats and re@@ members the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pos@@ ing is inspiring in a way because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans to Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Ca@@ stor@@ f relies on a colorful , fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows optionally a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with the Wall pin and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhine mur@@ ders pose as rock ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels recall Ca@@ stor@@ f &apos;s leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - which is moving through his &quot; Ring &quot; staging .
the three Rhein@@ tö@@ chter - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .

Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he shot Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must believe in it .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a strong applause .
stor@@ my is celebrated Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bows his hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in light of the great heat in casual leisure clothes .
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Ca@@ stor@@ f and his team of directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to let go of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pipe concert &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Ca@@ stor@@ f , but it was also an understanding of its view .
I prefer a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max is working as a volunteer
they work in several places in their voluntary year .
where to go anywhere ?
quantity : normally in stone s@@ ling at the furniture exchange , once a week I stayed here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I worked at the school already in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , i.e. a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does that come about ?
quantity : I have made Ab@@ itur .
and then a civil engineer &apos;s studies , let &apos;s say , successfully demol@@ ished .
I recognized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point perhaps too , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system during the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably make a social worker training in ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are going to be FS@@ J .
you can do it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me this was exactly what prov@@ oked me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really happens .
unlike in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well clear , here it is not about to calculate st@@ atics .
you always have other people &apos;s head , which have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , has been taken out of the family - you always have to face it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the type for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s the way life is .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that they will disman@@ tle more 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressures the company faces .
the job cuts , the Director General John Fall@@ on , for the most part announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to his previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 positions .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul Con@@ vo@@ i attack killed by NATO soldier at suicide bom@@ b@@ ings
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , Afghanistan , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , officials say .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , told NATO .
according to local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan met this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement , it is said that the explosion on Thursday night has happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive rate . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m airport .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban out of power .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies , and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA turns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has suspended a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , which states that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states acc@@ eded the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it shows the agency &apos;s obligation to cooperate with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to measure the o@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay one year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that will boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of demo@@ crats and conservation groups that worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter @-@ voices , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn Win@@ ner decides to set up a common room in the future senior residence .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing plot is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take place until the area belonging to the congregation has so far been owned by the church , there is now no planning for the project to be stem@@ ming from a private investor .
for this there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council prefer not to fores@@ ee such a common room as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living , but openly into the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision adopted by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn by means of funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the renovation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common space would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposed decision to signal the investor is that in this respect one does not want to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , the determination that both saddle and roof structures are le@@ aning - as well as pul@@ sed roof - which reduces the height and makes construction more economical - possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , this addition .
when it helps , it happens to the body unanim@@ ously .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation points to the many own buildings with which one can not move so well , but now you lean on the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely talking about the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a concealed subsi@@ dy of any asset or even foreign investors .
this is not the case because with the purchase of the surface there is no grant , but I get a real , in case of doubt market@@ able counter @-@ value , is the counter @-@ speech .
the proposal to ple@@ ad the proposed resolution finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts to the original programme that Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we believe the decision , we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with Car : Rad@@ ler is thrown onto the road
during the crossing of the street , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured .
as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road from the road of Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction of Hil@@ den on the bicycle path of the street Schwar@@ zer Weg .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
one in the same direction driving car driver gave him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove to the road , he obviously did not heed the traffic .
he met with a car , which controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ching wagon .
FC Bayern Munich has to do without the Super@@ cup at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ede
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with staff , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the staff of the German football record champion Bayern München are getting bigger and bigger at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
in du@@ el with the BV@@ B , coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti also has to do without David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
in addition , the mou@@ ths of Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats over the past six reviews , An@@ cel@@ otti is responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season .
&quot; football is also a tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into their spell .
the game is sold with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin the nation @-@ wide first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is planned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a Plan@@ etary Path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to meet the need for information from many hard visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Acces@@ sible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question came from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by internet .
that &apos;s why a good mobile network reception plays a role in choosing the location choice .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the star@@ path train is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewers experience much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars might have different colors , or why a star was stronger than another , although he left much further away .
also , in which con@@ stellation is a selected star , and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating the highest situated observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 in the Berg@@ städ@@ tchen St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy can be seen clearly with the naked eye .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned star@@ base - the Plan@@ etary Path .
starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e that forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ earth &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of tracks ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf @-@ planet - are positioned exactly at distance and scale from one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sco@@ op of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away and measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet &apos;s path is approximately four kilometres .
while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to stand with Plu@@ to .
thus pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next ruler would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future of 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council heav@@ y@@ weight champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ weight champion .
following Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ man World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia put out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
as the pair for photos posed , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect magnitude . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got up for bronze &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also took interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light weight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans have asked for it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later openly expressed himself openly on the network offering the best finance package .
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he considers Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may possibly participate in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko believed in the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three combat champion from River@@ side &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could sense the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injuries to tire plat@@ ter
in an accident on the A@@ 7 four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control over his vehicle shortly before the end of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ turned and then lying on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was closed in direction north for about one hour , followed by the traffic on the left lane to the accident site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener for the season op@@ ener to Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points points .
with the first round of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , because not the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two enemies too much , and we have to adapt even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain should also be further optimized .
and a gate after a release , the For@@ tun@@ ics don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better even after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ trumpet player than with the four @-@ trumpet player .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will operate in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just been able to build on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we do not make so many mistakes in building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann comes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing of it .
&quot; I first assess the start into the season after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e because the Sax@@ ons &quot; play had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a thunder@@ storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a little fres@@ her , because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 percent where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the internal defender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland usually go to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away just because we are entitled to get under the first six is rub@@ b@@ ish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chief Coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started performing tests last year .
they should take a closer look at the assessment of age during the asylum procedure after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critic@@ ised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 tests to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable over the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the investigated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that she was 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , during X @-@ ray imaging of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people , to see if they went sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot safely say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of finding a child as an adult is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted wooden bridge dressed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ developed .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border fixing , which is also used as an operating path .
in the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 m wide bridge door is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian path will run .
the special reason is that these are finished parts , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge @-@ caps .
particular t@@ act of fingers has necess@@ itated the laying of leads through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable where many companies are connected .
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ outs on the project .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting duct in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated in one lane by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully locked .
the cost of the three bridge compensation amounts to a total of 700@@ ,000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat .
the parties represented in the district of volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully on this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell invites to a loud poster &quot; great electoral campaign . &quot;
and famous names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the leading duo for the German Bundestag election on 24 September , and the deputy chair@@ person Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ eag@@ les but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the town @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well , but now takes place in the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D @-@ Event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ person of the Forum A World and one of the leading organisers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ me reports from the Af@@ D volcano Eifel , he made an effort to such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had initially asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there are not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ me is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also does : at about 20 o &apos;clock a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle , provides various speakers , including the Rh@@ en@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chair@@ person Uwe Junge .
there are about 200 listeners in the audi@@ torium , waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idents Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k hold their speeches .
the police presence is unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D @-@ Event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can cancel - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sts Freder@@ ic B@@ elli there is in the row Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach will sound like in a new ro@@ be , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s world music , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; from N@@ ils W@@ ogram , jazz , jazz and free games mix to a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this core of the program was premi@@ ered this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheeses and they will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly talked about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties was the one of their &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately broke apart .
despite all this , the brun@@ ette is assured of the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with everyone I &apos;ve been using .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;ve played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been pu@@ zz@@ led or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , she suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but at school , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think of myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , they do not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflections ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in che@@ ering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp had previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not appro@@ ve the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states and inherited a coal mine from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change by Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would hin@@ der us from working to make our country great once more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is without leadership from top to bottom and is not able to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ NC Chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , lau@@ ded on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to resume sport again .
Russian athle@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world championships that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All athletes , who were taken away with gold and silver med@@ als at competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognised by itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress was made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics Championships that start on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still fulfil some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told re@@ porters in London after a talk at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral p@@ act for soldiers dis@@ ed in Mali
at a funeral service in the North Hes@@ sian Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two soldiers in a helicopter crash in Mali have thought about a helicopter crash .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
in order to become even more un@@ enlightened , Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two rest@@ less pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts of their expert &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and delivered on Thursday by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
at noon only the members of the church took leave .
then the funeral service in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the German army and politics began .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the mour@@ ning guests laid down roses , the relatives were standing arm in arm on the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense from the Le@@ yen called the opposite soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tra@@ m@@ pled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built the flight operation of the combat helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ah@@ ler , commander of the regi@@ ment to whom the soldiers belong , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn away the crash , it would not have been possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubt at the UN Mission in Mali did not show ministers of the Le@@ yen : deployment is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally taught in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already finished a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision to keep it in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret of it that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he retired in 2016 and also covers the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by explained , the chief speaker of the Danish king &apos;s house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he worked for over the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were always fu@@ cking , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious stand at the Dan@@ es in his almost 50 @-@ year reign .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was gay , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of society @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed happy with this position and didn &apos;t feel ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP to a potential majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is reluct@@ ant to res@@ ign after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the Parliament voted for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising resignation of a Green MP from her state parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its tight one @-@ vote majority in parliament against the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ ev@@ oked her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to include them .
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regular on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Stephan Wei@@ l believes it is essential that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on further action on Tuesday .
the Constitution also provides the possibility that the State Parliament withdraw@@ s trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be assessed legally clean@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens &quot; step &quot; but something kur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a tra@@ der of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens sum@@ mon@@ ed the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their parliament &apos;s parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we , of course , assume that they have received immediate effect over the green state list with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President , Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests greatly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she deliberately decided not to lead any pron@@ unciation in the faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot follow this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition from Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the S &amp; D Group on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her desp@@ ised vanity and in her fru@@ stration , her personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ uties to include El@@ ke T@@ ests in the CD@@ U .
the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 state election with personal career gifts .
at that time the CD@@ U was strongest in front of the SPD , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one voice in the parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do we protect ourselves from po@@ ison@@ ers , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal occur ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is appointed Minister of Agriculture ( CS@@ U ) in an interview with the Editorial Board Germany ( R@@ ND ) Spe@@ ech and Ans@@ wer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if after all that we are currently aware of , a health hazard is virtually impossible .
Al@@ di now takes over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
in spite of this , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the sad@@ ness of Germany .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
just as the manufacturers are concerned , the trade has to bear in mind that the sold products are market@@ able and health @-@ harmless .
if the residual sugar level of eggs is exceeded by 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not market@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , not the establishments are to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge the production plants are not directly liable .
on the contrary , they must be reck@@ oned with economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there are too few inspec@@ tors in emer@@ gen@@ cies .
is there only a lack of personnel or the competent jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and the hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ utions in cases where crimes can occur are of crucial importance .
I have already made it clear that I expect a complete clari@@ fication from the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ er@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
through the sli@@ pped funds , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in general , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ loving animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high @-@ pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect all the competent authorities that the situation is solved quickly and without gaps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the football rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A because the guiding organisation that over@@ sees the European game has the power to for@@ bid teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of their contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
with security , PS@@ G can ease the money so that N@@ ey@@ mar is signing up and bringing him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , in the face of the funding of the team led by the energy rich dominion family of Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; associations may apply a lot of money to the purchase of players , but they have to counter@@ balance with legitimate income sources that allow them to break the break even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini according to his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , which in their quest for success had taken enormous debt , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin , when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from the concentration on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair .
during the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P @-@ postpon@@ ement period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of € 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen out of the presi@@ dency from the Pres@@ i@@ dency , his UEF@@ A successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in will continue to sc@@ are away from excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared with The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the proceeds will be reported for the next five years in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P @-@ sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income through companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be counted as legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEF@@ A decided that the value of P@@ SA sponsor@@ ing was infl@@ ated by Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar via payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s ambass@@ adors will be ambass@@ adors and that such a maneu@@ ver for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to ignore the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said the people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday .
they discussed the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a sponsor for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservation of La League against a state funded by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new source supplier
over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board has made Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board Cho@@ colate for the Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation stands before a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approx . 17 million small @-@ white packed sho@@ cks of chocolate spread over 14 grams per year before landing at the passengers .
Swiss Life didn &apos;t want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ der estimates the volume of orders according to &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious job for a creator .
the Swiss don &apos;t want to reveal how many applicants are in the new tender .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement .
since 2006 , chocolate boards distribute the Swiss on board their flights .
before the Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class are spoiled with goo@@ dies from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class washing passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short run , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i distri@@ butes Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and in Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a promising lady of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by sti@@ cking on the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play great kids who will grow up - nevertheless they managed to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the watering hole principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand Who C@@ alls the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character brow@@ ses through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now a novel@@ ist , still has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy vi@@ cious plot involved in Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good read by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ ant of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could heat up this fran@@ chise like a repeti@@ tive &quot; seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I considered his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene shows the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with his East @-@ West @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan &apos;s mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
with six long episodes it pul@@ ls away , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was edited on a smaller length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
blow against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office informed Kon@@ stanz on Friday .
15 defend@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , officials ordered large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
at the same time , two persons were arrested in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German warran@@ ts .
the two will therefore probably be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , heavy violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz has been investigating the organised drug trade in the south @-@ German area .
between the prosec@@ utions in Constance and Palermo was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning the big use was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the aim of the investigations was mainly Italian citizens with respect to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired up early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
Weise be@@ mo@@ urs large gaps in the For@@ eigners &apos; Register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the For@@ eigner Register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions regarding asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for the Federal Government &apos;s refugee management , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; severe wrong decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , in an analysis that is present in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the figures , ten million people with foreign nationality are listed in the Register , including about 5.@@ 7 million people from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
since the data has not been adequately maintained , data quality in parts has not been good until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases data from 1921 was found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer appear in the Registry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can slow reverse processes considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics of sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , who would not have to travel at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false regulations led , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently started sending refugees back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they immig@@ rated from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the paper , the paper says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BA@@ MF is carrying out such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state they reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , the state can send it back to the country of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with young children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given up guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other EU states would also send refugees back in the context of the Dublin Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach had already provided the blood don@@ key service for other people .
at least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
first of all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who meanwhile divided 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Council of the Council , the church recognizes the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our bodies are designed for it and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who provide their blood for foreigners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the director of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , for the cann@@ ed are broken down into their constitu@@ ents .
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions performed in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the D@@ RK network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house was led to higher numbers of atten@@ de@@ es a few years ago .
before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for each of 50 donated blood donations .
half so many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter spend ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life @-@ juice .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over a rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure .
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members pursuing a rise in this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on fiscal income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it signals that over the next few years , interest increases would be needed to cur@@ b the inflation that was heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it , and it said that credit costs would probably have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut business package which was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although said that now it is expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , since pressure on the real income of households is still bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than markets expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the Po@@ und fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to avoid any change comes after the recent dis@@ appointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations on a rate of interest and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to lie at 0.3 % in the third quarter despite the fact that it will recover slightly after the Bank &apos;s end of the year .
the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor pay increases , as the tightening gets worse first before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the income gap in the coming years , but she added that wages will recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which is offset by a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes after a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the pounds .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased because inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July demanding an increase of 0.5 % .
the inflation has fallen from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said it was expected and will be put on in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said the exceeding in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent down@@ turn of the Swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are lou@@ dly looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks very good for those in which the existing deals are exp@@ ended and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are closed , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; as of September , patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ posi@@ tional proph@@ yla@@ xis before sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by healthcare through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to allow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ posi@@ tional proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV drugs that are taken prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduced HIV transmission at risk of infection .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who are eligible for treatment are gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local attending sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract for delivery of drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in cop@@ ing with one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if it is aimed specifically for vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected and that it will contribute to the end of the dis@@ semination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something similar to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage room and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function up or down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over@@ looks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ lin illumination set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow him to work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units provide space for all cutlery and glasses by Jo@@ anne .
by perc@@ ei@@ ving a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; Er@@ fan explains about the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so that when you push the door , it is very easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or as your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the size of the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square metre number of something standard in something quite astonishing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate dollar
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a debate on one of the largest real estate imperial Victori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold to US $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De LU@@ TI@@ S now includes offices in the Stad@@ tz@@ en@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - described by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in has property valued at 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul in the value of 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reviews proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed plac@@ ements .
the brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage several possessions in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance reports that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both sides held lawyers law firms .
Ms. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen stores from the late 1950s onwards and bought a store in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , where Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark had paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has with@@ held himself very backward , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t really say much &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wished that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mps of new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including reports from the news media - hoping to hold the head on a more uniform course .
here is a piece by Re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House Chief of Staff , met with senior staff on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mps White House he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tru@@ mp by over@@ seeing his media diet .
President Tru@@ mps &apos;s relationship to television reaches decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tru@@ mp was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said former electoral competitor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp &apos;s Twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral campaigns , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mps &apos; s Twitter custom was ever &apos; under control &apos; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that Tru@@ mps T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more combus@@ ti@@ bles without their intervention .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp did not send .
if his collabor@@ ators have made it a few times to keep his anger away from him , then their efforts have paid off .
but no one has maintained it consistently that Tru@@ mp is calling controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties will always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that may promote their views of the world .
politi@@ co - dealing with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors to supply the president with dou@@ bt@@ ful information .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he stiff@@ ens out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened at the end of February when someone malicious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has sold false alle@@ gations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them .
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; gold @-@ makers added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the aid of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police throughout Europe send in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals on the run .
since the addresses of the most sought @-@ after criminals are not known in nature , references from the population will be hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the promotion that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar in winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that many volati@@ le vac@@ ant destinations hide , it was called Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 post@@ cards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there is the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ w , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .
36 of the online users have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to references to the publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands again stand with some determined travellers on the foot of the war who negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn by the congregation to rec@@ laim a field in front of their manor houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of vans after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch from the Council to prevent their incur@@ sions .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense units and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said , &quot; They went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back again .
more came last night , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding a long brief@@ ing to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my municipal charge if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of this travel@@ er just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country side of Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to pass them on as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible call an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is hosted by the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH , on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income through the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the Land@@ rats@@ amt as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious prospects in the house already back then .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus Categ@@ ory under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are welcome to Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for some time and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings were broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest Style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ arranged , new windows will be installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
you don &apos;t want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , emphasizes Sch@@ erer .
Sch@@ erer continues to explain the Lu@@ ise forest hotel with its approximately 60 rooms .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already conducted talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are coinci@@ dental with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the amount of investment asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to determine exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external plants are also brought forward to the front , which is clearly visible .
there is a large terrace in a courtyard that is open to the public from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Represent@@ ative sets up a Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , Special Agent Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the panel has received the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to people familiar with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has wi@@ dened and intensified his investigation .
the CN@@ N reported that there are already first inv@@ itations of the board in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time , targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mps electoral competition team and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus of the investigations is to face several men who acted as consultants of the re@@ public@@ ans during the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a closer look at more and more Tru@@ mps private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Tru@@ mp personally ind@@ wells the center and for@@ bid whether the President could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the wake of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether charges are to be raised .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also referred to as counts of indictment .
most of the time they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office for inviting persons to be inter@@ ro@@ gated under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mps counsel@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his current election campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were at the meeting .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in U.S. television that the installation shows that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charge of an indictment .
nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tru@@ mp .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the Democrats a chance to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they do not have anything else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he didn &apos;t know anything about the suspension of a Grand Jury .
this work , however , usually works in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it would not be determined against the president .
one has no reason to assume that something has changed in that direction , it was said in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had not been used until Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey was fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ra@@ ging accus@@ ation , alle@@ gations against Tru@@ mp have become lou@@ dly , he did not want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , Com@@ ey asked a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to set up an investigation against the then National Security Ad@@ visor Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president is under great pressure for the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected footage against the special agent and its staff .
this triggered speculation as to whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent special agent of the Congress , as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later @-@ worn President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the ur@@ ges of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented legislative proposals on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Antar@@ ctic a giant ic@@ e@@ berg of the nearly seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has solved itself from the ice shelf .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , which weighs over a tri@@ l@@ lion ton and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it is mel@@ ted .
with 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest ice giant that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger to human beings .
to what extent climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear after research data .
in total , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us so far .
ice shelf swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this ice shelf , the equilibrium of wa@@ xes and break@@ downs was disturbed some years ago .
a complete cow@@ ard is broken down , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f is in danger as the front edge has never been as far back as at present .
in addition , the ice sheet stands under tension and can be dis@@ assembled if a piece is broken at a key point .
melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and pressur@@ ize ice as much water as it produces after melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a lesser extent , the British research project writes for the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50,000 square kilometres .
at the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural happening and no direct link to climate change is aware , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , it is disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C file will grow again or go back in the long run and possibly collap@@ sing , &quot; said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these researchers don &apos;t bring back the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , there have been a lot of ice @-@ ra@@ kes in the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula in recent decades .
this long skir@@ t of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
according to the research program , British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the decrease in temperature increased .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees in the past 50 years , counting on the areas where the temperature is rising .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U asks to exit from the employers &apos; association in order to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs were inst@@ inct in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day behind them .
the teachers in circles are obviously very sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the seats in this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still lacking staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
there are currently 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann circle .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are looked for .
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should work out a concept for recruitment and human resources development after the parties &quot; wish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demand to skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application short@@ ages .
the overall concept should focus internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this requires a high number of employees who leave the service for illness or age .
so high time for action so that no more jobs remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter races , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he had long ago caused a big surprise when he publicly questioned the staff@@ ing of the staff and amaz@@ ingly surprised the remaining parties .
people want all the possibilities to be checked , which allow an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the county government should strive for a house @-@ tari@@ ff with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money only exists when one changes to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new constitution protection law .
last but not least due to the growing number of asylum seekers , coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ates the tone on NGO &apos; migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti , in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team effectively collabor@@ ated with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express himself in detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving the human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are currently raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is suspected that his crew adop@@ ts din@@ gh@@ y migrants who are delivered to them directly by traffi@@ ckers and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart for the ships to be used again .
at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast , according to the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s file whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must first have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; major changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation Mé@@ dec@@ ins With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti said in the meantime that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and the cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and attractions .
there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream plains .

in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga consoles for e @-@ sports
will the sport stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
fact is : e @-@ Sport has long been a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ ys included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have also recognized the first federal li@@ ais@@ ons who are increasingly involved in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain that there are several clubs rising on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend the FIFA World Federation organized the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in London , where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , for example , have qualified for themselves .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football needs to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people are still going to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs were trying to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under the contract one could be more often present on these markets online , than once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in the E @-@ Sport computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the FIFA World Cup match FIFA at competitive level .
as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long since established itself in which professionals compete against each other .
e @-@ sport is already part of the official program in the Asian Games 2022 .
but is it all about a proper sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ y also dealt with the question for a long time .
for Professor at the German Sports University in Cologne e @-@ sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - for example elevated heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also exercise their body and look for nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ rob@@ y also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform when playing online , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are on the move internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural obstacles .
a study by the company consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ aktive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in E @-@ Sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales will be 130 million .
this is little against the 2.4 billion euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the move .
major markets are Asia and the US , where former basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports dealer Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot to do in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ y .
in the Netherlands and in France , the soccer @-@ first division clubs according to D@@ utt are now oblig@@ ated to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to fall into nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is not enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time align the company with the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that only football stays as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter because of the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy pushing for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to par@@ ole .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June due to the neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took up his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until his vocation .
she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffer from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward turned eyes when it was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she totally regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I am not rob@@ bed of the loss of my beloved Son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , despite all my pain , which we will carry for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , arise yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention paid attention by the death of Roy and ordered that by some press she should benefit from the case .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ich : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run Kim@@ me during the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern hon@@ ors a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation is not har@@ ming .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ ich immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ame and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the rush to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first assignment as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the one could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the coach could interpret Kim@@ me as well .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a guide in the C @-@ El@@ f from youth play , de@@ but@@ ant and just from the holiday , but he .
it is best to distribute the sugar to those with a lot of ingredients that you want to keep in your mood .
those who were chosen to take the legacy of L@@ ame can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old took a mini @-@ lead over the field .
to the right rear , this is now his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and at all , Kim@@ i worked in this initial formation like the one who can take the helm at the very best .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe .
he had the view for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fold hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on de@@ vil@@ s come out to establish the benefits of the Asia journey ( fol@@ ly also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le are not neg@@ atively affected in their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ cot .
after all , it worked quite well .
South was running beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm often took a lot of trouble , in addition , Sü@@ lt also tried a couple of times in the game build @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also caught up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how unusual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in connection to the game .
for example , in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , Ru@@ dy did not have one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said goodbye to his new fellow players after some cr@@ un@@ chy statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you simply have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new guy any more .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most well @-@ known foot@@ ball@@ ers have reported on Twitter shortly before the game and the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies wished all the best .
the Bavarian Legi@@ on@@ aire is a quasi club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ captain Schn@@ ader@@ beck and fe@@ ather@@ ed with our ladies .
the tweet of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winners should be a special motiv@@ ational sp@@ lash .

companies satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : Wirtschaft pra@@ ises Wis@@ sing Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than one year in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ enquiry of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old Minister .
Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing acc@@ esses the wishes of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the main turn@@ around sees nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the gap of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is expected to be building legislation .
a role in the country &apos;s plans is also played by the west circum@@ ference of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Office for Transport .
the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ dge Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
of course , of course , there is a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce ) ( Chamber of Commerce ) ( I@@ HK ) is striving , as by Wis@@ sing , a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label in wine to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports that have been bag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber of Commerce commen@@ ds .
the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed exam and 2500 Euro if graduates have become independent within ten years of the master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , facts can be created quickly , at the same time it lacks the land at the necessary staff , says Jan Glock@@ auer , CEO of the Chamber of Commerce of I@@ HK Trier .
from 56 new engineers who want to employ bis@@ sing in the state @-@ run mobility , only 29 positions have been occupied so far .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U spokesperson refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country investing in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less than suggested in the maintenance of country roads .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept as to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies rated the power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ pol@@ l only with the grade 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and out@@ breaks .
former Minister of Economic Affairs E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of the wind turbine Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke as of April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she already cleared the field after four months because of discre@@ pan@@ cies .
Audi has to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW president said the company believes that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus applied to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes cars modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a call@@ back .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the costs for the automobile manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ alisation of exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles also take into account what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of rej@@ ecting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid Volkswagen &apos;s mistakes , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
several employees of Volkswagen were indic@@ ted in the United States , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system in order to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously affect Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the gain of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar @-@ visitors to participate , a raft goes through Munich on the mor@@ row , which has a special message .

the start of an ou@@ tre@@ ach campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shall shar@@ pen the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protected wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ oses and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed cartoon characters , the bul@@ lies of his characters are his hall@@ mark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an stands still and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he suggested , among other things , as a sign for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to the end of the 60s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits on the drawing table , works almost ten hours a day .
about cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ ll figures still find widespread dis@@ semination worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and TV series with his characters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main character in the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los is the most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand foot@@ er as a counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence is threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of dro@@ ught conditions and insect @-@ borne insects , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years , which in spring has brought much less rain and in the autumn much more .
this has an effect on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , which transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts tourists not only for holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; instead of having very long plant clo@@ cks with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak of security .
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home .
security experts wrote three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary to submit percep@@ tions and gut feelings .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the salary list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest of violence , and while the bodies are pil@@ ing up all over the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to took office in December 2012 .
among the latter there is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is deeply felt even though his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the 1930s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ era .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared issues , trauma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der Federal At@@ tor@@ ney Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings have been initiated , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are unconscious and even though the terrain is even more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we str@@ ust all of us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a someone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its precious har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings contributed to the murder .
at first there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival Kart@@ ell fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans children .
this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ ster @-@ members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to not comp@@ el Val@@ dez after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , to leave the country for its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the intoxic@@ ant problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to deal with .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever she led .
he willingly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that you serve as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the spaw@@ ning bird , who was able to curse like a dock worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is His love for the routine of His destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best and remain alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret starting and landing ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells false , stay away .
the trouble is , the editor of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened to J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were suddenly allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which was sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ range district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor himself did not call trust@@ worthy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months since the re@@ porters went into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has concentrated on three main hi@@ stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures focused on the home town of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducting a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traffi@@ ckers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated almost the whole century all political levels .
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped military assault .
only a few months earlier , the readers would have watched the column of Val@@ dez as the most informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we would have known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was turned into storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the staff became something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped a few characters and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
throughout the country , journalists have become more powerful by writing down &quot; S@@ OS Press , &quot; organized protests , on foot@@ paths and buildings .
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez moves away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and letting them kill because they said the truth .
she has been asked to be re @-@ classified by the government since she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objectiv@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of organised crime , government officials and a valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who put together the organised crime under a blanket .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and civil servants last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , you die , because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note , allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that drug trafficking was scar@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and drank beer , as suddenly all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to bu@@ zz .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ ages and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further , as promised by a number of Kart@@ ell em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the edge of the cur@@ bs , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren he@@ ul@@ ts near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were frigh@@ tened at all , they did not show it .
under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid their enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening one .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain min@@ ers have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even find that his fla@@ ky skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had something of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that out of the surrounding rock seemed out of place and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 l@@ bs@@ . ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ umping .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you just blin@@ king a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the principal author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - Mon@@ a Lisa the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used an shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ burial , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to be better to interfere in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of sheds and arm@@ aments over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous time must have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on information about his life , including his preserved intestinal content , in order to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r when he died , got into a river and dri@@ fted into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as Süd@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved fla@@ ky skin but retained even in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just shooting a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it &apos;s on sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs , passed through the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tonnes heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he founded the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21st , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the world &apos;s best preserved din@@ osau@@ r , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips , which were sha@@ ken by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were washed by the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the door@@ steps still cover b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
how Michael G@@ resh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic is such a level of conservation as &apos; rare as a lot@@ tery win .
the more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
I can count the scales on its sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
a violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , long @-@ long stops - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information of the police at 5 p.m. between the outlets Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( administrative district Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed into each other .
in the first place , no data on the exact number of the injured were concerned .
it was light to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man .
a large supply of emergency vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a back@@ stage was approximately ten kilometres long .
like an A@@ Z re@@ porter , it was also on the counter @-@ lane to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle le@@ vers , which have now to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between an automobile transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group test &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : you sit in the train and sleep .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : buff@@ ered .
does the conductor come and w@@ akes an uns@@ af@@ e or tears the passenger in the midst of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ticket inspection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one simply confirms by phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available at many other distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements need to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which already has the most passengers .
it also has to be purchased via the app of the railway , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers then show a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train atten@@ de@@ es get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
if the train driver arrives at the ticket control at the Y , he knows that a passenger sits there with already de@@ valu@@ ated online ticket .
so you can still sleep , work on , keep silent .
check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn takes advantage of passengers .
&quot; if you want to travel without ticket control through our train esc@@ ort staff , simply check out the DB Navigator yourself .
this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr , Marketing Director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the biggest offen@@ ders .
because often you have , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors not all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing .
the result is endless discussions between the train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and the conductor takes time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and that is also only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , the St. Louis B@@ or@@ ene was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a mail from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because no one else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she put her mobile phone in order to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of police tape and people shou@@ ting , and of a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman secured his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from age 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a fitting crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation , which she had innumerable times before this morning , &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on now because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take them with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution know and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blat@@ ant racism , it is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
Fer@@ rell and her daughter were connected to a local owner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r just wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former Co @-@ Director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates .
his engagement brought the project closer , along with six other locals , the team of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets followed in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are portrayed , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim was not to focus on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result documents of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that in this work and in the hum@@ ani@@ fication of black people there must be some vulner@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ um &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Berry Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must wear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell has been chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman there is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the message cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV reader discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has since the first presentation in 2009 divided the population into advoc@@ ates and opponents .
the theme hardly leaves one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be great &quot; ( Nicole shows ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , the other shops also benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will ble@@ ed out .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work it will be an end .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - ad@@ mitt@@ edly to the Bed@@ a Square with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years we have been buying in the farmer &apos;s market almost weekly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country women are always very happy .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery , pay attention to the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping palace in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ store or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops here are empty - some of them for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is well worth it .
as you can see , store shops are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies , because the rentals there are often not acceptable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special transactions are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peasant market hall be located during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes out at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to sell all transactions from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall there are many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once the farmer &apos;s market hall is demol@@ ished , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ conspic@@ uous - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st banned a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after making publicly stu@@ ffed diplomatic messages on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ gender and ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
through algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg got a sharp , albeit slightly intellectual commentary not only in the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but openly talked about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six viol@@ ins against the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly sitting at a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg arrived just from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ tes and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she couldn &apos;t be photographed at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photographed so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became un@@ equal spectac@@ les that exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a cartoon illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the president Chel@@ epa rendered judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp will lead a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid fis@@ sur@@ es he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing asked with her over@@ sized signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , &quot; whose basis gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ meter of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was hoping to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own space , is a page from the above comic novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing , how it emerges with a hands @-@ free hands @-@ on in the hand of the disciplinary barracks of the United States , like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they pay your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never simply the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t personally seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ les , which form like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg about portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also hiding behind her deliver@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for murder
a nationwide crowd hunting is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as reported by the Cook County State Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the site of the event , and det@@ ectiv@@ es examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
La@@ them has been professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them has now been judged and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a criminal affair , which is examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urged the susp@@ ects to submit to the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building that had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that were La@@ them and War@@ ren in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Grand Plaza management team published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code describing the criteria for the re @-@ installation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly subsidi@@ zed dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has established a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing committee .
in conversation with Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody expected to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters of Moscow &apos;s headquarters in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your business not to become the closest U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the p@@ olls didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there simply never was consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has called people from outside for help .
a new human resources start @-@ up race is at the wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , to offer special groups and demo@@ graphics groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
saved as a favorite to look at new things you post ... &#124; Hello , just wanted to mention , I liked this article . it was funny . keep oon posting ! &#124;
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , there is a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most ail@@ ments and which managers have low cons@@ ents results - so you can drill down why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture you have to stay in order to avoid the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the financial @-@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behaviour , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber trap in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent allows companies to send tailored &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS Hot@@ line that staff can report bad behavior .
and when the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Public Opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that handles its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , &quot; said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and in@@ convenient experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now , as the company Con@@ ver@@ cent uses , problems that were previously hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment liti@@ gation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry to go online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and pol@@ lu@@ te the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
g@@ listening secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and earned his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more of their jobs than before .
in competitive markets like Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only used .
staff want you to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ tes when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
indeed , if a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough or not at all , this can increase disappointment and dem@@ oti@@ fy employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have too much left to collect data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you do not follow , people will ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employees surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem was reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Sav@@ ed .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into its employees , and hopes that in the long run this leads to a better relationship between employees in an industry known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the bru@@ ises
it starts at 11 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have moved out their jer@@ sey tops and show off the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break .
players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ in @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually length@@ ened their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood carry out practical exercises .
they should perform 18 exercises during August . 20 before the start of formal preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the multip@@ lier routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous load on it three or four days and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ate themselves further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which is not an easy task in view of the clear line of sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already cleared a protective network behind a gate .
brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a cleared one that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ check in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications to third parties and show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and send them to invoice audi@@ tors , which may indicate possible results of the invoice audit from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false hi@@ stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be launched .
&quot; in addition to realizing what stories are challenged by fac@@ ten@@ sors of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes in his news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Bew@@ are River Valley in K@@ ent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ iry Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ dile@@ ction for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said melanchol@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist , Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have responded only to the thumb print on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell in smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome shot &quot; ) all this seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated through the area and the ruins of the old castle and talked with landscape gardening , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ crats said &quot; Oh , cast it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent who owned it : &quot; you might think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight for the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let everything go their way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man leaving the newly built castle to join the farm stand of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion which occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patron , which the family Dar@@ rell hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell was portrayed in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was first made years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite cro@@ ok to always pay debts and spend money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to adverti@@ se land@@ ings . &quot;
after the end of his mission in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique scre@@ ams experience
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature ever since .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered
with the launch of the 30@@ 1 @-@ year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City of Bad Honnef began its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) on Friday .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan confidential even until Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a celebration on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as a Bad Honnef citizens we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a stand @-@ alone promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she stands in competition with other municipalities .
a middle five @-@ digit amount can be used to make the City of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military Re@@ forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pen@@ sion@@ ations and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so this week too .
at first glance a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the seat of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the Heads of State , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the deliber@@ ations .
as a result , the civilians were in the over@@ population in the Y@@ AS .
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the ex@@ iled pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as a wire drawing of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons , who were supposed to have participated directly in the attempted coup attempt , has been negotiated in Ankara for this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine gift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
at the end of February , the paper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article titled &quot; Un@@ ease in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the abolition of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for soldiers , wrote the paper .
in any case , the large @-@ scale system in the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan guided another 7@@ 3@@ 95 state servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the real masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
following his victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan sh@@ ook the power of the military step by step , last not least by calling on the European Union &apos;s reform agenda .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is driving forward an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt , will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that is true , such a development could not let Nato be cold .
in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after the pur@@ gations of the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted by the media .
he prefers to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way citizens are spent in other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that benefits our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for road@@ side shuttle
over the past few months , over the past few months , the future of the race ticket sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it is going to be quite fast .
even before the end of the year it is to be built on the mar@@ o@@ des @-@ track , on which the tourist bus drives , is built .
in order to safeguard the future of the road@@ side shuttle in the long term , construction work on the route will begin in this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is particularly important for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of over@@ hau@@ ling the track dropped to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country over@@ looks 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being finally agreed , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gian railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned agreement between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle will be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation , whether the route is used by enough many people to order them again in the future .
in addition , the route is steep in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it can &apos;t become more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun about them , but the companies are delivering a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex@@ i@@ ps have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; customize &quot; his robot according to his convi@@ ctions and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex@@ i@@ ps have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as timi@@ dity .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Comp@@ ani@@ on with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of timi@@ dity and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Comp@@ ani@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired of being fix@@ ated on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female properties , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : conflic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah , uns@@ ett@@ led by the most .
on his website , true Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their emergence and increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R records their growing popularity , they still remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what escap@@ es from the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives permission .
there is a certain overl@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots show up in a time where the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House that bo@@ asted women have been sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the worn body and the cast eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can not separate or simply walk away from your companion .
they do not have a mediation or background story , nothing that points to independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total subj@@ ection .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the words of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of tru@@ mp .
we all pur@@ port@@ edly shar@@ pen ourselves in order to burst our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power of bringing together Tru@@ mps , families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist den@@ ser who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House everybody who knows it , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and very strange on the same side .
around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the disa@@ strous effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be expelled .
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness .
today I find myself falling away from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp were indeed a very mild criminal off@@ ence .
if Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can will only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels in the New York park department , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals turn to look frigh@@ tened over their own shoulders - extremely fin@@ er and the climate @-@ per@@ mitting music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings will become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is in fact not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still an odd magical experience , as two two @-@ year old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and have all a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one asked them .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where there is no need .
the poor woman in the department store stood exc@@ essively gr@@ ins@@ ing while I tired of the experience to submit her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moves from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
in the past year , he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrist , which he re@@ port@@ edly suffered from prison authorities in a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to first death sentence due to murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 by taking them through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der that hid in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us Appe@@ al , from which they say that it is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Law En@@ forcement Administration said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection may be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is liable to increase his sentence to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four @-@ t@@ all@@ ers from F@@ ingers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released in the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the premi@@ er students are going to school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , the school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of school discharge , the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle , who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conducted a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chickens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and had it ro@@ ared by his chickens .
instead of chicken farming a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him , the eagle sm@@ ashed , and the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain , and fled .
after that classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les that bore cylinders to the bet .
the eag@@ les stand for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte .
the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ year @-@ old boy that he feels accepted in his new school .
there followed thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps at instruc@@ tional bott@@ len@@ ecks and the parents &apos; representatives .
the cu@@ cum@@ ber period is over now , declared class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , she only divor@@ ces her students , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ t@@ all@@ ers .
all students completed a song of summer time and holiday time .
at the same time , great joy broke out with the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .

software update for diesel vehicles : what the affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must Diesel drivers participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars .
they are supposed to improve the emission behaviour of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europa offers assessments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for vehicles that have Schum@@ an Software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the re@@ armament has ordered the German Commercial Vehic@@ le Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced swift implementation in the coming months , but they have not yet called an exact date .
Daimler announced to write to everyone concerned .
if any inspection is due anyway , this will be done within their framework .
how long will the conver@@ sions be drawn in total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this will depend on manufacturers &quot; commitment as well as political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen that the autom@@ akers are not acting voluntarily on the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming it could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do who don &apos;t drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE recommends to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would prefer , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a threat of a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
in rural areas there is so far no loss of value for older diesel engines .
the ACE recommends to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving under President Tru@@ mp promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to be one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ors this year .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awards ceremony .
the winner Le@@ ar , which was introduced with progressive TV series , already announced to refrain from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has made a decision to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to make her point of view clear .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
the previous prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city liv@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into retirement in the coming year .
the place is already written out - but suitable applicants are rare .
for 31 years , W@@ acker has been Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press brief@@ ing .
he reports on varied but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it amaz@@ es that no application has been fulfilled until now .
at the earliest possible time , the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer .
so - taking into account the regular periods of notice - there should be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach functions as a sub @-@ property authority for the administrative community , the applicant must instruc@@ t appropriate conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they can no longer fill them , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but clos@@ eness to the city is important to the city and it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between authorities and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ hof parking lot have been initiated .
the Kin@@ zig@@ Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stage renovation is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will beat about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it correctly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is plenty of room for a master builder .
with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dener can react quite flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have an eye for what fits in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going Stadt@@ bau@@ meister emphasizes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister already has a high degree of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( high @-@ construction ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for more than 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor stays long , W@@ acker desires : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further development of the city .
who would like to bury Roland W@@ acker should , according to information of the town of Has@@ lach be able to show a completed study as a diploma engineer or b@@ achel@@ or with subject architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of building and building planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) is subject to civil engineering and civil engineering , construction planning , real estate matters , administration of urban properties , urban depot with building yard and garden gar@@ dener as well as lower building rights authority , including monument protection .
bike thrown on lines : closed @-@ road track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad track transfer in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines .
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them since the night hours .
near the crime scene , a ros@@ ary roller and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond the Laus@@ bu@@ b realm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch at the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ators would have put themselves in danger themselves and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay of delay and the costs for rail transport , even P@@ ön@@ alen of the railway customers could get to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum came out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern railway track could be managed without disabilities .
just under ten passenger trains were off Friday morning , two of them entered the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall out , but they were late .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recurring or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the intest@@ ine to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food cannot enter the body .
cells capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the balance tends too far towards inflammation , an inflammatory bow@@ el disease can result from this .
experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance inhibit@@ ing immune cell is found in mice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium takes tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote more toler@@ able , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus when the same system works in people as well .
the post@@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had been separated , did not .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of the mice were sequ@@ enced and there were found six species of bacteria that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they were developed to L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers allowed L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice &apos;s food , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inside of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last high season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cks off on Tuesday on Tuesday , and impressed in the role of the holder , as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira are advancing at will .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also launched in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four main obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , for that I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the US , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertisement in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new drau@@ ght for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD boss , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Minister , before elections , always looked after Berlin with a certain concern .
only no fire from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the electoral milit@@ ants .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the provincial capitals of the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with counter@@ wind .
there were failures .
and one after the other .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once more shows : red @-@ green can simply not reliably go@@ vern , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber , Germany &apos;s editorial office ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , surprisingly , has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Sunday election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party executive Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the apo@@ state Lower Saxon Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ ests to give back their mandate .
the transition to CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ hats must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and election campaign leader of the Gre@@ ens of the Editorial Board Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD suff@@ erer si@@ ghs , when on Friday morning the new message message reaches the party centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the resignation of the Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ wo@@ ken to the CD@@ U without his own government majority .
it is the preliminary high point of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD &apos;s state associations .
and no one knows what &apos;s next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat in the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades cal@@ med down at that time .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
then it became - and indeed everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to squee@@ ze , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te pulled the party smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the weeks after@@ ward , comrades , the comrades once again stepped up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next depression .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD head of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus during this weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in the crisis communication he did so pretty much everything that could be done wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for some time .
mi@@ ese conversion values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely for this reason , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the course of the last weeks .
the ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained un@@ concealed in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they allowed him to give him , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , Wei@@ l at the party @-@ internal purpose of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens is basically no fault .
and Schulz is not at all .
at times , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is intol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ ests places her own career fairs on the interests of all the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , leader of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the Editorial Board Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. T@@ hats has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person but on the state list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the member of the Lower Saxony Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that they are giving back their mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the lower @-@ Saxon SPD as a leading candidate in the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career presents of a future CD@@ U @-@ MPs fal@@ si@@ fy the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or has given further commitments of the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding for local politicians III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development informed them on Wednesday in emotions .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a look back to what has happened so far .
since 1991 there have been in sensi@@ ti@@ sing areas of rehabilitation .
at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment zone I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the existing refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on 4 April , the Information received by the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe that there will be a restoration area III .
the amount of funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500@@ ,000 euros came from the country , the rest of the Municip@@ ality of Sensi@@ tivity .
how is a remedi@@ ation area now created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area to rehabil@@ itate .
if necessary , the territorial limits could then also be postpon@@ ed .
the pi@@ er represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the renovation would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working relationships and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is , per plot .
the renovation area would then eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the funding period for the funding is ongoing since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September of this year , however , the survey would only be carried out once , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the declaration of association should be carried out as soon as possible , so that the renovation can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that every municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .
it is a question of assessing the issues of urban development and deciding when to renov@@ ate and to what extent .
there will also be a reminder in the Land Registry for the respective plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sensi@@ tivities and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphasized that an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled in by the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where it deals among other things about the structural condition and the renovation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information regarding size , division and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled when business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to be considered , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of subsidies after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - who first comes , grin@@ ds first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could not reserve subsidies for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Urban II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself uses a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory An@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now incorporated both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military data left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter made in Connec@@ ti@@ cut was exhibited beside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn following the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the deputy naval commander for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter hit the South La@@ wn on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning and remained until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 was evacu@@ ated this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the safety staff of the unit remained on the plane during the time on the plane .
from the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second type of flight was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal workers to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the provision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we posed was whether it was a violation of H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sounds like you &apos;re locked up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus for reform of health reform , which was in progress in the Senate , and he advoc@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to demand its use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
in February , Tru@@ mp took an examination as the presidential air@@ plane made his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often perform training flights in the Washington area and South La@@ wn to ab@@ ort the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 performed 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted on the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ters flew in addition 11 hours on that day for &quot; Non @-@ Pres@@ idential Com@@ missions . &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a Si@@ kor@@ sky spokes@@ man said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget labels for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Secretary of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of on@@ eness record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determining the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for stat@@ s is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates contain personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at this time , the former press spokesperson of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter &apos;s commitment to the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course reasonable to highlight this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear if Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire car .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tricky task
leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga comes to the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V in the Tab@@ ellen@@ bach@@ tal S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite after five games still flaw@@ less , the top @-@ runners of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga got the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , in any case , has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially at the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high north ensure above all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to jobs in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri Hel@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is becoming difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of happiness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
at the moment in the Challen@@ ger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man not at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec , will be the first in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the white @-@ Russian An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again push back to the team .
for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ranking List in January 2016 , someone from the Train@@ erst@@ onwards fills the cad@@ re with Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp was not really happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for tightening sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress wrapped a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that help Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors have been disturbed by the O@@ MV ( O@@ MV ) , which co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian east@@ ward expansion of Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies .
the dr@@ one is huge .
however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , thus the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to bring the sanctions back to life by an Executive Order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the series of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos who reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer , Net@@ fli@@ x &apos;s series is far from over .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the newest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; with more state bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dami@@ an Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is their head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites U.S. and Colom@@ bian prosec@@ uting authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .

role reverse : the city has 46 kitchen aids
the town organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens the clock is turned back .
on the 1st of September , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked is still out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked ch@@ illed .
in the Kre@@ feld district , the city operates 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past year of kit@@ ebo@@ arding , 28@@ 00 children were sitting at the tables , and the demand grew steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 days of the week in the K@@ ita lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay until 2 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff from the 1st September kitchen service : they warm up the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , pour out the food , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; Pom@@ er@@ anz says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital administration to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - is done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of kitchen power also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical cost comparison of the city as the most economical , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time staff are recru@@ ited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 people in education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , official leader of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be chann@@ eling in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women are fully participating and involved in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Taliban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over to the government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afghan independent Ele@@ ction Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concern over investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make a long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow in Man@@ agers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which in addition to other products manufacture hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch office , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s urge to express &quot; concerns that the financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of t@@ oll@@ cross concerns our members deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workforce concentrated heavily on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of workplaces , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the increasing cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently looking for a flour@@ ishing production presence with Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman at Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only yesterday was T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to it as we value the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we like all companies active in a highly competitive and uns@@ af@@ e economic climate , constantly review our business - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we acknowledge the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility fully and entirely . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has PS@@ G Barcelona warned against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the website of La League may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not rel@@ inqu@@ ish N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after issuing a £ 18@@ 9 million offer to release its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the record of the world record ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the world &apos;s highest paid professional athlete . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of over 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside , although a source near the Catalan board insi@@ sts that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago ?
when Manchester City in 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that it would not allow the International of Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price deals for N@@ ey@@ mar .

on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um , with his VW , was coming from Stol@@ zen@@ au at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese .
in the area of the b@@ ypass road from Stol@@ zen@@ au a passenger car met him in his lane so that he had to devi@@ ate to the right .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the abuse cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication to the German Press Agency , he anticipated an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would be very useful for the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false evaluation of the events at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in case of reporting on violence in the cathedral @-@ cats with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the violations in Regensburg , no one doubt that it is a matter of &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of den@@ ying the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis , too , said in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; you like to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hits were quite normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with reports on mis@@ use cases , Pope John Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce tape &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have to protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he analy@@ zes the results of the final report .
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment At@@ tor@@ ney General Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s with high plau@@ sibility .
in the final report , it is said to be Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially in the case of high emotional quality , the punishment for the students could also be more intense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other defend@@ ants , many victims estimated that many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even had positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence by shel@@ ters at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students emphasize his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as ch@@ oline and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was tangible to the econom@@ ist , if a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in it at all .
to him , just eight pages are dedicated and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of the complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also occurred outside its sphere of influence .
one can at best repro@@ ach him , experience it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atz gymn@@ asi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he worked was perceived by practically all those sur@@ vey@@ ed - literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the vast majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents a very excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy , and &quot; always surrounded by grapes from children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotional attitude , which even led to out@@ breaks .
the fact that he wasn &apos;t just popping up with chairs and throwing the key on the ground , but also dealt face sla@@ gs and pulled too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he had already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think every one of us who was born in 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
in comparison with what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school , this is certainly tri@@ b@@ ulation .
you ask yourself if it is not more familiar with his fame and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just r@@ ushed upon him .
in the Bavarian pop@@ e many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves George R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was reported in the media .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also accused of any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
no single of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of those affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a ch@@ oral director , who , professionally , would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I consider it ... even for really absurd to assume that ... Bu@@ ben have opened ob@@ tru@@ sive or clear or even more clearly than towards their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , tru@@ ckers etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the report concludes with a clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the run @-@ up to affected pupils and / or their environment , it could not be confirmed in the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of any fellow beings .
thus he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as unfortunately in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of George R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean separation : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and exc@@ esses as well as , we say once , other alle@@ gations .
in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir leader of the cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole horrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were down@@ right and suffered terri@@ bly , were all ex@@ propri@@ ated at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first when they were already on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this was , as most of the witnesses emphasize , the subject of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; para@@ dis@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even have positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so at most still the accus@@ ation remains to be looked at .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently lose his ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral school gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pre @-@ school will continue to practice the punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test fin@@ es were banned in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each one of us still knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit has been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked out .
this is simply not true .
it was only in 1980 that the inspection of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis said it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , the danger of judging the past according to contemporary moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is already right .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was horrible and not for what was vom@@ ited at the primary school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at that time .
this is all terrible and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be worked out .
but at the same time I must protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing the ears and the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Regensburg time has George R@@ atz@@ inger shown in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject Prü@@ gel sentence also come into the speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective that the cathedral @-@ cats only played a secondary role .
nevertheless , I do not mean that he conducted a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without requiring un@@ condition@@ ally discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of space , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and can@@ dies alone , the rebel@@ li@@ ous boys will once again have no big vo@@ cal@@ ist and before any success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience George R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deep faith and heart @-@ good people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do anything just a fly .
I regularly receive with how many former domains still keep contact with him today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ tierung , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
those who have not yet for@@ given him that he was strictly speaking to them , are therefore clearly in the minority .
most of the cathedral @-@ cats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lovely respect@@ ful person to which they still look at today and which they almost rever@@ e .
and please , once more clearly : everything that one repro@@ aches to him are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day .
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a media sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that stands behind it , only too obvious .
for the report that has just been published will relieve him .
now the rig would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
