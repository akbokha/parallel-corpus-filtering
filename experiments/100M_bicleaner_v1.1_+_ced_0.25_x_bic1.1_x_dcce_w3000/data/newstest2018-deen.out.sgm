<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish prison, where young people today are to meet.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where now is excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Husbandmen manage the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich is sponsoring exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this because the car-Navi was showing a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but precisely for this reason very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork which one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the big picture postcard, more detailed maps, so-called documentary sheets, were incorporated into cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first measurement of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops marched away with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, there were the present-day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung (" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The original document for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was made 21 years after drawing up the map, so in 1877, in the Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today lies Untersendling in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 alongside today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is today, there is nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered flurry from the so-called "Ursus" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small parcels now show no farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "at the guest" "" "or from the height" "" "Auf der Lüften" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with delusion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich circle-asylum company" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was created there." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the so-called" "" "Irren" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he forbids the personnel to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the museum Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place was, later on 500 places were expanded.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar, 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, Isar-Amper-Klinikum, Munich-Ost, is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">The area of the former Auer Anstalt is now meeting young people in the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west lies the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was erected in an architectural resemblance to the origins of the Irrenum, which had been destroyed during the Second World War with bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" "" "Main Square" "", "the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn race track.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ombudsman publishes Travel Notice for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fares has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for special attention to Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri, since a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur in the whole state and be noted here," "" "is said in the group's opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the state's law enforcement authorities who are disproportionate to minorities, the group decided to issue the warning, "said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that people pass through." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report by the Missouri General Public Prosecutor's Office in which it is shown that black motorists in the state will hold 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be prepared to bring money or let relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI-hate crime series, which classifies the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had adopted immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling according to ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Chilean fence project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac's CDU members have taken a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the District Court of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU village association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially provided insight into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many kittens provided and housed in five apartments holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest milk" "" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">The table of the Feriengäste is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also the Chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as" "" "fundamental importance." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't work profitably on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area care for a lot of work, much must be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with topography," "" "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not perform a biogas plant.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leaders" support. "</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be dragged out quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they can continue their operations," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of the support</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open-up area is 40 hectares, which cannot be fortified up to 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of them were promoted via leader, one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the big advantage is the longevity of fences," "" "explained Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it doesn't work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiss was firm:" "" "here, best food is produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape care guideline (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state-of-the-art conveyance of wheat fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to disclose the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The condition is the presence of a conveyor belt designated by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the fenced area must not be smuggled (hanger climb above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fischerbacher Childecaunching project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open-plan area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposals for drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it attacked its meaning, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta recently complained, "I don't want to go to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem which you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance on the begging words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who long to breathe freely, / the miserable falling of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time in which the" "" "miserable trash" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends, who sat down to place their words at the base after their death, knew very well that they took up a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical illustration.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself has a completely different name: mother of Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty didn't invite anybody, but rather an early neoconservative who will bring the American flame into the world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not illuminate the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is rather unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen from the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the Great Britain team</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the United Kingdom Athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butcher - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team for team captain.</seg>

<seg id="150">The team captain says they are "immensely proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also will be involved in medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being a special team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the preheating of electors</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the papers beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked on the critique, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union was accusing it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very clever to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side is a public forum known as officially and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing in the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans of Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani von Bowie, Md., was not filled with water, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't really appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the staff of the Governor referred to as" "" "concentrated spam-attack" "", "others would probably call" "" "intercession." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous times when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical control items or to arrest demonstrators and to silence them.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck their lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>

<seg id="421">Elektro-thousandsassa Elon Musk are happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla Model 3.</seg>
<seg id="422">He has so far been suggesting that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their noncommittal reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the ever-triumphal figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed another less dazzling number for the first time in the announcement of the recent quarterly report: the cancellations made at the new mass market model 3.</seg>

<seg id="428">At present 45,000 of such non-binding reservations took place in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 cars.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be assembled - 500,000 will be one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 bookings are made per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you order today a Model 3, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla is able to drive its brand-new, never-tested production lines with maximum utilisation in practice.</seg>

<seg id="439">EPA boss Pruitt moves back because of the reluctance of the rules of the Obama Era to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the governmental environment authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "it is a deadline that ran for States on 1 October to meet the 2015 standards for down-to-earth ozone." ""</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the observance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfere in local decisions or impede economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who before his appointment by President Donald Trump was a prosecutor of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulation that resisted the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Prusion regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its reversal in ozone standards simply boosts the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines for implementation, and then waited to set up an appointment for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job." ""</seg>

<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress push for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet to be voted in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York-based Attorney-General Eric Schneiderman, who led the Coalition of States, who had sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain the legal pressure.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Bergkirche, a Serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16th, at 4: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of Tumbling to their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini stresses:" "" "it is a unique village treasure." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilary Chapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Provincial Register: "count Hermann von Sulz sold" the mountain with the parish church at the Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document according to the deed, on the Hill of Tumlingen other than the former parish church there was also a magnificent courtyard, which belonged to the church or the patron law, and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which today are still recognizable in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "Berg" the third, the wonderful settler-core of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps of the period around the year 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patron of patronage arose from the early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied it with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two shrouded at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were cut and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlingen Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the steeple was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's night in 1834 a storm split the steeple and half rushed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the present-day tower remained as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem cultivate the Hilarius facility by Dieter Dockhorn as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">The organizers invite friends and promoters of Tumbling on Sunday, July 16th, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "Hartmut Romann's local stand speaks the final word." ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">To the end of the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers take a fantastic view.</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers look forward to many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is of great importance for tumors and audioblets.</seg>

<seg id="506">"" "the association" "" "Boisheim defends itself" "" "has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at all, as at the time in Viersen, only at the border to Schwalmtal, a wind power concentration zone existed.</seg>
<seg id="509">Construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible within this concentration zone, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones are intended to prevent" "" "saving" "" "the landscape." ""</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had already decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette only a few days before, but this was not approved by the Düsseldorf district government because of a fault.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning permission, the granted permission is still illegal and therefore also to take back," "" "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of Boisheim." ""</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break the municipal councillor once again decided to open the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval by the district government is still pending.</seg>

<seg id="518">However, they do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">"" "with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday didn't want to express itself in regards to the argumentation of the association" "" "Boisheim" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on an area at the Boisheimer Nette to build four wind turbines, each 200 metres high.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the establishment of the four wind turbines, electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - that is equivalent to roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re plans to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="534">As the Chairman of the Gewerbeverein, Christian König, announced that the "home shopping" weekend should sensitize customers to what offers their own city provides away from the usual supermarket product.</seg>
<seg id="535">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, local firms should present themselves with their training places.</seg>
<seg id="537">"" "in addition, the shops of the city centre will invite to" "" "midnight shopping" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="538">The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region.</seg>

<seg id="540">City administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="541">This means that the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the "Attractive City Centre" project.</seg>
<seg id="542">This includes new offers such as the first "active day" for well-being and salvaged Sunday, conversations with all the trade-owners and hosts, in order to move them to active participation.</seg>
<seg id="543">Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials are to be re-opened again or again.</seg>
<seg id="545">This includes spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals would have lost the city centre when shopping at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end, everyone would have to contribute to enliven the city centre - to the landlords, the factories all over the city and clubs.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network that made itself part of it, and the king had said in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the Chamber of Commerce in Mühlhausen, informed that Germany's third "home shopping" day, for the first time, is participating in five Thuringian cities for the first time.</seg>

<seg id="683">Where to go anywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: normally in stone sling at the furniture exchange, once a week I stayed here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I worked at the school already in the open whole day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, i.e. a late-called volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">Quantity: I have made Abitur.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineer's studies, let's say, successfully demolished.</seg>
<seg id="693">I recognized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else, work with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what you do.</seg>
<seg id="695">Do a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, in the focal point perhaps too, really is.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it so?</seg>
<seg id="697">Quantity: I collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in the social system during the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">I will study dual, probably make a social worker training in jugendamt Herne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.</seg>

<seg id="710">You always have other people's head, which have a completely different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee, whether a teenager, has been taken out of the family - you always have to face it individually.</seg>

<seg id="719">The British education group Pearson said on Friday that they will dismantle more 3,000 jobs and cut their dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressures the company faces.</seg>
<seg id="720">The job cuts, the Director General John Fallon, for the most part announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, comes in addition to his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 positions.</seg>

<seg id="725">Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, told NATO.</seg>
<seg id="726">According to local reports, three civilians died in the incident in the district of Qarabagh.</seg>
<seg id="727">The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan met this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="728">On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="729">In a NATO statement, it is said that the explosion on Thursday night has happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised explosive rate."</seg>
<seg id="730">The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital on the Bagram airport.</seg>
<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="732">According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="733">At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="734">The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.</seg>
<seg id="735">On May 31, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadliest militant attack of the country since the US-led troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban out of power.</seg>
<seg id="736">The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.</seg>
<seg id="737">Correspondents say that in recent weeks the suicide bombings in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government, their policies, and especially in the call of President Ashraf Ghani.</seg>

<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the Municipal Council prefer not to foresee such a common room as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the seniorous living, but openly into the church.</seg>

<seg id="759">The proposed decision to signal the investor is that in this respect one does not want to throw a billet between the legs, the determination that both saddle and roof structures are leaning - as well as pulsed roof - which reduces the height and makes construction more economical - possible.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer, this addition.</seg>

<seg id="907">In April, the works began at the same time on all three needy bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a vaulted wooden bridge dressed with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly redeveloped.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>

<seg id="918">This is a border fixing, which is also used as an operating path.</seg>
<seg id="919">In the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20 m wide bridge door is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian path will run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special reason is that these are finished parts, a patent by the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge-caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Particular tact of fingers has necessitated the laying of leads through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-optic cable where many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed in advance of the work by handouts on the project.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crayfish first had to be fished.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the football rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA because the guiding organisation that oversees the European game has the power to forbid teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilians out of their contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">With security, PSG can ease the money so that Neymar is signing up and bringing him to a galaxy of other stars, in the face of the funding of the team led by the energy rich dominion family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">"" "" "" "associations may apply a lot of money to the purchase of players, but they have to counterbalance with legitimate income sources that allow them to break the break even point in their football-related business." ""</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini according to his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, which in their quest for success had taken enormous debt, effectively cheat and risked to ruin, when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from the concentration on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year-old FFP-postponement period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of €30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini 2015 has fallen out of the presidency from the Presidency, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin will continue to scare away from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared with The Associated Press in the past week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the proceeds will be reported for the next five years in the amount of EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP-sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income through companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be counted as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsoring was inflated by Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar via payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have denied that Neymar's ambassadors will be ambassadors and that such a maneuver for UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to ignore the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA had no pre-preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, said the people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They discussed the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>

<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a sponsor for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent Neymars away by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>

<seg id="1194">And there's another crazy vicious plot involved in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good read by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's sublippant of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of accidental madness that could heat up this franchise like a repetitive "seven Up!" series until he reaches that which I considered his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene shows the gang of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" at Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with his East-West-West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a director is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>

<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan's mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes it pulls away, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>

<seg id="1213">15 defendants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, officials ordered large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the same time, two persons were arrested in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects Italians there were German warrants.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something similar to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage room and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel works are quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function up or down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Moulin illumination set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow him to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all cutlery and glasses by Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By perceiving a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went in," Erfan explains about the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is important, so that when you push the door, it is very easy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or as your property is estimated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the size of the floor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home" "", "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square metre number of something standard in something quite astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate dollar</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a debate on one of the largest real estate imperial Victorias worth over 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp debate about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold to US $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De LUTIS now includes offices in the Stadtzenrum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin has property valued at 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the reviews proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed placements.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, have excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage several possessions incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian inheritance reports that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the event, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, among them Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides held lawyers law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De LUTIS and her husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessen stores from the late 1950s onwards and bought a store in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the first jeans of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark had paid $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark are," "" "Paul" "" "has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has withheld himself very backward, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin answered by SMS to say" "" "I can't really say much" "", "because the case is before the courts." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps of new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the media abstinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including reports from the news media - hoping to hold the head on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F. Kelly, the White House Chief of Staff, met with senior staff on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the president." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by overseeing his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship to television reaches decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to convince," "" "said former electoral competitor Sam Nunberg in February opposite politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral campaigns, insists that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps' s Twitter custom was ever 'under control' is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trumps Tweets would have included even more combustibles without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his collaborators have made it a few times to keep his anger away from him, then their efforts have paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has maintained it consistently that Trump is calling controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties will always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - dealing with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors to supply the president with doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he stiffens out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This happened at the end of February when someone malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been permanently banished from Twitter for chicans, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has sold false allegations in the past and revoke them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking people about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "gold-makers added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof through the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH, on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income through the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">At that time, the decision was not undisputed.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious prospects in the house already back then.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus Category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: U.S. Special Representative sets up a Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, Special Agent Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "the panel has received the work in recent weeks, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "on appeal to people familiar with it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller has widened and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN reported that there are already first invitations of the board in connection with a meeting between Trumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time, targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumps electoral competition team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"" "" "" "the focus of the investigations is to face several men who acted as consultants of the republicans during the election campaign." ""</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller took a closer look at more and more Trumps private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Trump personally indwells the center and forbid whether the President could possibly hinder the judiciary in the wake of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether charges are to be raised.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also referred to as counts of indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office for inviting persons to be interrogated under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN, pre-invitations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps counselors and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his current election campaign manager Paul Manafort were at the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in U.S. television that the installation shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charge of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the subject gives the Democrats a chance to" "" "feel good" "" "because they do not have anything else they can talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he didn't know anything about the suspension of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This work, however, usually works in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates any action that accelerates the work of the special agent in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it would not be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">One has no reason to assume that something has changed in that direction, it was said in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had not been used until Trump Comey was fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this raging accusation, allegations against Trump have become loudly, he did not want to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "" "" "in June, Comey asked a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the then National Security Advisor Michael Flynn." ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected footage against the special agent and its staff.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special agent of the Congress, as in the Watergate affair around the later-worn President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the urges of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>

<seg id="1521">The colossus, which weighs over a trillion ton and 5800 square kilometers, is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest ice giant that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear after research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelhagus so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Ice shelf swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelhagus lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this ice shelf, the equilibrium of waxes and breakdowns was disturbed some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete coward is broken down, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Shelf is in danger as the front edge has never been as far back as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet stands under tension and can be disassembled if a piece is broken at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and pressurize ice as much water as it produces after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a lesser extent, the British research project writes for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelhagus is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural happening and no direct link to climate change is aware, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, it is disputed whether the Larsen-C file will grow again or go back in the long run and possibly collapsing, "said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers don't bring back the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, there have been a lot of ice-rakes in the Antarctic Peninsula in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research program, British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decrease in temperature increased.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees in the past 50 years, counting on the areas where the temperature is rising.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU asks to exit from the employers' association in order to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, 41 new jobs were instinct in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 apprentices have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers in circles are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the seats in this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle is still lacking staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">There are currently 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann circle.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration, are looked for.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in management.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "the administration should work out a concept for recruitment and human resources development after the parties" wish. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term demand to skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortages.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should focus internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a real" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This requires a high number of employees who leave the service for illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So high time for action so that no more jobs remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter races, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long ago caused a big surprise when he publicly questioned the staffing of the staff and amazingly surprised the remaining parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all the possibilities to be checked, which allow an exit from the municipal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice, the county government should strive for a house-tariff with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns -" "" "says nations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually foresees the tariff for public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money only exists when one changes to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new constitution protection law.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Last but not least due to the growing number of asylum seekers, councillor Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy exacerbates the tone on NGO 'migrants' lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they must not continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," "" "said Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, in an interview with the Turiner daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their team effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express himself in detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving the human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organisation in a statement on social media." ""</seg>

<seg id="1586">"" "the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of" "" "Youth Rettet" "", "the Iuventa, since October." ""</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is suspected that his crew adopts dinghy migrants who are delivered to them directly by traffickers and that smugglers can depart for the ships to be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the public prosecutor's file whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats like Iuventa must first have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring" "" "major changes or obstructions" "" "of their rescue operations." ""</seg>

<seg id="1594">"" "" "" "Minniti said in the meantime that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and the cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern Palatinate for four days to enjoy Trials and attractions.</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three friendly guides available.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">Viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there was always longer ascents for the long trials rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1607">On the last two days a lot of altitude metres were announced.</seg>

<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhaled curative brine in the open-air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga consoles for e-sports</seg>
<seg id="1613">Will the sport stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through wind and weather over the stadium racing?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-Sport has long been a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gays included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">"" "" "" "we have also recognized the first federal liaisons who are increasingly involved in this area." ""</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent e-sportsmen under the contract one could be more often present on these markets online, than once a year to send the Bundesliga to Asia.</seg>

<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, Ligen has long since established itself in which professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">E-sport is already part of the official program in the Asian Games 2022.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it all about a proper sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Froby also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For Professor at the German Sports University in Cologne e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - for example elevated heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW president said the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," and thus applied to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes cars modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a callback.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The costs for the automobile manufacturers to install equipment for neutralisation of exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also take into account what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of rejecting the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which could regulate the use of so-called off-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">Several employees of Volkswagen were indicted in the United States, others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system in order to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request that was focused on the United States has been expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously affect Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the gain of Volkswagen.</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist he suggested, among other things, as a sign for congratulation cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, the breakthrough came to the end of the 60s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in the "Stern" and other leading magazines all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits on the drawing table, works almost ten hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1788">About calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and clocks, his droll figures still find widespread dissemination worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence is threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought conditions and insect-borne insects, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years, which in spring has brought much less rain and in the autumn much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an effect on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small zikade, a microbacterium, which transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is a lot on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts tourists not only for holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said, "instead of having very long plant clocks with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slowing of evaporation from the soil, but also spraying plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year anniversary.</seg>

<seg id="1808">Cranes, guilds, traders, vaginas or a country shelter should be experienced in the inner city these days.</seg>
<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak of security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts wrote three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary to submit perceptions and gut feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the salary list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest of violence, and while the bodies are piling up all over the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter there is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is deeply felt even though his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamera.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder Federal Attorney Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are unconscious and even though the terrain is even more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we strust all of us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story Mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its precious harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">At first there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival Kartell fractions in the war with Guzmans children.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have angered the sons, presumed gangster-members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not compel Valdez after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, to leave the country for its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the intoxicant problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard-fitting examinations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever she led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He willingly admitted that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue to live," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ Award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you have to take over the task that you serve as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked," "" "What have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not tell what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the spawning bird, who was able to curse like a dock worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Is His love for the routine of His destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best and remain alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret starting and landing ways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells false, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Feodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones were suddenly allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which was sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-range district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor himself did not call trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">"" "" "" "it is months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto control." ""</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has concentrated on three main histories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures focused on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor, conducting a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped military assault.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers would have watched the column of Valdez as the most informed source of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "earlier we would have known what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El Flaco" "" "because of his slender body stature." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was turned into storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the staff became something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few characters and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country, journalists have become more powerful by writing down "SOS Press," organized protests, on footpaths and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day, the director Bojorquez moves away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and letting them kill because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has been asked to be re-classified by the government since she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico are" "" "surrounded" "" "of organised crime, government officials and a valid society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who put together the organised crime under a blanket.</seg>

<seg id="1931">He met something that out of the surrounding rock seemed out of place and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 lbs. (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumping.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinking a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the principal author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.</seg>

<seg id="1938">The strongly armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used an shielding technique known as counter-burial, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed it to be better to interfere in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of sheds and armaments over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use counter-shading - think of roe deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, indicating that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on information about his life, including his preserved intestinal content, in order to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur when he died, got into a river and drifted into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, passed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tonnes heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mummified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he founded the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21st, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips, which were shaken by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were washed by the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the cremation of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they haven't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has since the first presentation in 2009 divided the population into advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The theme hardly leaves one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"" "the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery say: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be great" (Nicole shows), comes from the other side: "don't need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, the other shops also benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work it will be an end.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuous - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst banned a 35-year prison sentence after making publicly stuffed diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Through algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, Dewey-Hagborg got a sharp, albeit slightly intellectual commentary not only in the formability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but openly talked about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violins against the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning was visibly sitting at a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg arrived just from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts from forensic artifacts such as cigarette buttes and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't be photographed at that time and she couldn't be photographed so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated mice became unequal spectacles that exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a cartoon illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the president Chelepa rendered judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump will lead a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid fissures he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning asked with her oversized signature among them (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to "automatic fragmentation," whose basis gender, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandmeter of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg was hoping to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopaedia of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own space, is a page from the above comic novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, how it emerges with a hands-free hands-on in the hand of the disciplinary barracks of the United States, like King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there simply never was consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care society Madison Reed.</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new human resources start-up race is at the waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, to offer special groups and demographics groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>

<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behaviour, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber trap in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the Court of Public Opinion has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that handles its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, "said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and inconvenient experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company Convercent uses, problems that were previously hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice.</seg>

<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glistening secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and earned his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are expecting more of their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only used.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Staff want you to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach Rendites when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough or not at all, this can increase disappointment and demotify employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4000 suggestions, you must be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have too much left to collect data.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't become more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we must start taking their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun about them, but the companies are delivering a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexips have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "customize" his robot according to his convictions and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples up to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a stepford woman look progressively." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexips have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as timidity.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality" "", "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired of being fixated on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female properties, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step to Frigid (i.e. here: conflicting) Farrah, unsettled by the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, true Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "is it on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR records their growing popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what escapes from the marginal zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots show up in a time where the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House that boasted women have been sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the worn body and the cast eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can not separate or simply walk away from your companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They do not have a mediation or background story, nothing that points to independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total subjection.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the words of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of a healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all purportedly sharpen ourselves in order to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of bringing together Trumps, families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist denser who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everybody who knows it, including the Republican kinship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and very strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disastrous effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be expelled.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as the epitome of reasonableness.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself falling away from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return) - both in comparison to Trump were indeed a very mild criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican will only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York park department, and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals turn to look frightened over their own shoulders - extremely finer and the climate-permitting music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings will become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the Theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel is still an odd magical experience, as two two-year old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked them.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where there is no need.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood excessively grinsing while I tired of the experience to submit her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius moves from prison to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">In the past year, he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrist, which he reportedly suffered from prison authorities in a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to first death sentence due to murder following an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013 by taking them through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder that hid in the cabin.</seg>

<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells are patrolling in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food cannot enter the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result from this.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance inhibiting immune cell is found in mice that carry a specific bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium takes tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerable, less inflammatory bowel milieus when the same system works in people as well.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been separated, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were sequenced and there were found six species of bacteria that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they were developed to L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's food, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inside of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2672">Who wants to renovate his house in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg Urban Development informed them on Wednesday in emotions.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back to what has happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991 there have been in sensitising areas of rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the refurbishment zone I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>

<seg id="2679">On 4 April, the Information received by the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe that there will be a restoration area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The amount of funding amounts to 833 333 Euro, of which 500,000 euros came from the country, the rest of the Municipality of Sensitivity.</seg>

<seg id="2684">If necessary, the territorial limits could then also be postponed.</seg>

<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, that is, per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The renovation area would then eventually be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The funding period for the funding is ongoing since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September of this year, however, the survey would only be carried out once, within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire for filling out.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the declaration of association should be carried out as soon as possible, so that the renovation can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently explained that every municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the abuse cases relieves Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," declared after publication to the German Press Agency, he anticipated an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful for the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their false evaluation of the events at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that in case of reporting on violence in the cathedral-cats with" "" "double standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In view of the violations in Regensburg, no one doubt that it is a matter of "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of denying the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis, too, said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you like to go to the church and this is a found fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" "" "hits were quite normal pedagogical means" "", "" "" "to deal with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They find it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports on misuse cases, Pope John Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the Remembrance tape" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he analyzes the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report submitted by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment Attorney General Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s with high plausibility.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to be Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotional quality, the punishment for the students could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many victims estimated that many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even had positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger has relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence by shelters at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students emphasize his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as choline and perfectionist, which was tangible to the economist, if a Domspatz brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">To him, just eight pages are dedicated and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can at best reproach him, experience it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "Domspatz gymnasium" "" "on which he worked was perceived by practically all those surveyed - literally -" "" "redemption," "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the vast majority of his student Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warm-hearted," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teachers who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy, and "always surrounded by grapes from children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotional attitude, which even led to outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he wasn't just popping up with chairs and throwing the key on the ground, but also dealt face slags and pulled too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he had already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think every one of us who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In comparison with what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, this is certainly tribulation.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You ask yourself if it is not more familiar with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed upon him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope many who have never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves George Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen was reported in the media.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No single of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said one of those affected," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust parents and siblings, certainly not a choral director, who, professionally, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen student Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "concerning sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even for really absurd to assume that... Buben have opened obtrusive or clear or even more clearly than towards their parents, dormitory leaders, truckers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "in this way, the report concludes with a clear result:" "" "in the run-up to affected pupils and / or their environment, it could not be confirmed in the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to speak of any fellow beings.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was a lot of" "" "violent excesses" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking out" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the middle of George Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses as well as, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were downright and suffered terribly, were all expropriated at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first when they were already on the gymnasium gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this was, as most of the witnesses emphasize, the subject of" "" "pre-school" "" "tabu." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even" "" "paradises" "" "states." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even have positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at most still the accusation remains to be looked at.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently lose his ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral school gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "the pre-school will continue to practice the punishment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test fines were banned in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each one of us still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit has been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked out.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was only in 1980 that the inspection of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "" "snare of anachronism" "", "that is, the danger of judging the past according to contemporary moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was horrible and not for what was vomited at the primary school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terrible and I'm glad that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing the ears and the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Regensburg time has George Ratzinger shown in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject Prügel sentence also come into the speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the cathedral-cats only played a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not mean that he conducted a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without requiring unconditionally discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of space, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candies alone, the rebellious boys will once again have no big vocalist and before any success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience George Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I have met Georg Ratzinger really well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep faith and heart-good people, of whom you can't imagine that he could do anything just a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive with how many former domains still keep contact with him today, 23 years after his Emeritierung, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not yet forgiven him that he was strictly speaking to them, are therefore clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-cats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a lovely respectful person to which they still look at today and which they almost revere.</seg>
