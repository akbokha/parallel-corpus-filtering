28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the body found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , distributed the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , announced the ABS channel K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had earned his dream job as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed at the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gali@@ cia claimed that Frank initially lived in Host@@ els but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said that he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
connecting his way with his family was to always cook something to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of discussion .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SF@@ PD at number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star in an interview is now un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or aff@@ i@@ xed by the outside label , which usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , these things are rather dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress prefers to spend her time at home , in front of television with lots of junk and Mexican food , it is in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she brings the question of the desire for child@@ birth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little change with some colleagues with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sports Py@@ ramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feeding trou@@ ghs .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it wasn &apos;t a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career came again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses .
he left with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he sw@@ ung not even for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ dorf as part of a small gala the Golden Sport Py@@ ramid .
there is no lack of awards to the symp@@ athetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen had already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th winner of the sport pyramid is long .
in Aachen , he met the first prize @-@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the tw@@ o@@ fold U.S. Master@@ s@@ si@@ eger was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the expert Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jumping rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand @-@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza Prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mps Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are un@@ divided in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
of the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt small and cau@@ tions how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wanted to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely re@@ strain regulation , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfill , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
that is why the taxes for the rich would increase , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Tru@@ mp and Clinton are almost wor@@ rying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans nation@@ ally .
so there could be party @-@ internal discussions on Tru@@ mp .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , to announce the Paris climate protection agreement .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand renewable energies with its investment programme and demands : &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ acific trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but just to better protect American jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should also be better paid , say Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of US $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
he wants to raise it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ushed , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens , is facing growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics argue that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers shelter .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arms .
he looks curious in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Business Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are P@@ oultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all @-@ frozen women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs worked together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say : every woman who arrives here has experience in her escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically because torture or death threaten them or because their families send them as hope @-@ carriers to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ our@@ able murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end , as soon as they come to Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
this leads to the fact that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the North of Munich are traumati@@ zed , appreciate them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about what they experienced because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not know how to help , it takes more accommodations only for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
on the question whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some reply with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is such a thing in housing of governments .
also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia , fled women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Unter@@ - und Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are floors in some common shel@@ ters or houses for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women be accommodated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy or men and women are lod@@ ged together , there can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush that is available at the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have spoken about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new work combat measures
representatives of the assistance physicians have called for their union to appro@@ ve new labour competition measures in their dispute with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labor campaigns starting in early September .
the J@@ AC said that ministers had refused to respond to the concerns about the contract .
assistance physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A in July .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members , who voted for the elections .
in a letter to the members , who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ AC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; would have had problems , which led to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ AC has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and call for official re @-@ negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Committee today asked for a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating labour competition measures that commen@@ ce at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that assistance physicians struck six times this year , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A assistance physician Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 veter@@ in@@ arians and medical students , stating that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for physicians in England would be introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I can &apos;t deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be nar@@ rower and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan spoke repeatedly by his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day a newspaper compla@@ ined that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if there was never anything worse .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness demonstrated that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was angry .
Putin distributed and accused Ankara of having reb@@ elled against Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend .
building the ve@@ to will be difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state controlled media conducted a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
the most serious were the accus@@ ations from senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s territories controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan , first and foremost , needs all the friends he can get after he was dismissed from his office last month on a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - notably the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght to the Mediterranean .
this week the state television predicted cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted taking over power as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the persistent gru@@ dge about the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this brilliant palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , one as an analy@@ st once described to me , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate the West and feel badly treated and now allied .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ em@@ aker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they would not even have stri@@ pped the issue .
the President of Turkey intentionally promised to answer a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey threw the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank head of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since dis@@ soci@@ ated itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions pounds of sponsorship from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ central headquarters and stock exchange quot@@ ations will be changed to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the retail business that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am saying that we do not pursue global goals , but local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different , and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to move to the bank of the brands , as we focus internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we said that we would be a great bank to our customers and have launched those brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market at Pre@@ dile@@ ction
D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone in Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won against G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here as well
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ ering when he gets the victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 victories in a rec@@ ord@@ able career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career opportunities
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only a few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but it &apos;s his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a thrilled fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already won almost 30 years of winner in GB , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous Gl@@ orious Seven , 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties at the beginning when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ y his doubts and to return to his best form .
and he is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his minimum age of 5@@ 0.@@ ten .
Russian Putin &apos;s chief of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly released his chief of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the tigh@@ test confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin it reads that without giving reasons Putin ordered Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a substitute for Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it means ( in Russian ) that later he was the director and Chief of Staff of the governing personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your work as head of state in respect of bills of law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ants and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will withdraw at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few are convinced there - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official claim that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , once again wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , which are cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov says it is true that I have asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust me for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V received the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was the chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin reached power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia , as a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another close ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired when he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated last month in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced his termination in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his resignation .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son out of the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be released at a later date according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will not be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28 September .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that at the 75 fish it could be Sand@@ al , which were sp@@ iced out by a fountain of foun@@ tains .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives around 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope hoping that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers connected the north deck of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling bo@@ b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incl@@ ine ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witn@@ essing an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the entire deck de@@ cks are in place and the last section of Dec@@ ks gets a concrete casting for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ oriented high@@ - and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the landing page .
this was reached by dra@@ gging the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , about 6,000 tons weighs and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
hei@@ gh@@ tened , because the toler@@ ances on which the team were working was tiny - on each side they were only ru@@ sting a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown out by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck by 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm on Friday after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty in swimming , while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat in its proximity and put the worst off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds blowing the boat out of its reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fisher@@ man , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a bo@@ je dro@@ oping without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have been lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boat engine had a stop@@ over , it was released by the person who controlled the boat when the boat was boar@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone has guarded these men today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
seriously injured - man pi@@ kes his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcohol @-@ induc@@ ing offen@@ ders cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this came into the apartment , he st@@ ole on her twice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was hurt by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
this then al@@ armed his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companions .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old che@@ ered up his sister and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds cheap apartments from Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Invest@@ ors should be taken much more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wohnen @-@ Concept Living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next council meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fight is programmed .
first of all , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments will have to be considered as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the reasonably priced apartments can also be built in inventory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but to build as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development program that will cost millions and still have to be financed should provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few regulations as possible .
the Left wants even harder jobs for investors .
regardless of whether viol@@ a , there is an intensi@@ fication of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get skilled workers .
but the programme does not yet exist : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you reconci@@ le the loss of another 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments , whose support will exp@@ ire within the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm should now be bought out b@@ ind@@ ings from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring flats back to the price binding .
this is possible in the west city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the West@@ stadt , the end of the year dates back to the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the number of social dwell@@ ings in the western city is increased dramatically , one removes themselves from the goal of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mixing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few districts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gre@@ ens assume that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must go to the boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has focused on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness which pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time playing on screens has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then video games and most recently on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( over a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; captured &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the U.S. , the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an Apple Watch app that pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of launching the game , the number of follow @-@ up people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for the increase in performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for health that people want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring and coming from people who look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that is fun for them .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there are also gru@@ m@@ bling games that have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk around a door .
what shall it do ?
it has occurred a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will dimin@@ ish with time .
however , due to the success of Pok@@ em@@ ons , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all of this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now also Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast ra@@ ked on Thursday for a multi @-@ battle title and enlarged the gap between herself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ team A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American women of Simone Bil@@ es cont@@ end on the floating beam during the individual multi @-@ competition of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American who wins a multi @-@ battle title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success represents them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years her sport , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - won with such amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescu@@ on from her said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so very much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment .
the American female Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ competition of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark at the farewell party of the retired crew coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although it insi@@ sted on having planned for a long way to the top , never having planned the future , it is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um where Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any more competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes .
even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina was easily led by two rot@@ ations the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
Swedish beams and floor plans - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship title .
she got up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor another one .
Ra@@ is@@ man gently embra@@ ced her when she expected her final appearance - pure form@@ ality - and tears poured on Bil@@ es bright red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collective book .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man of the team , called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her down@@ fall she threw down the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ eba , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ al is concerned , the rapidly expanding twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in mass mur@@ der@@ ers when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot , who had died in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a drive , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police said that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y of rob@@ ber@@ y , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are associated with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in His@@ panic homes within four months and two more were injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting which was aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his old friends Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I don &apos;t create it .
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let myself into that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a subsi@@ dy .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is progres@@ sing slowly .
he can run and cycle with support .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund presents for &quot; Please sing me something in front of me . &quot;
&quot; we teach him a sign language , &quot; he told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic , as with Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ci@@ ca@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the people infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me anyone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives rise to Res@@ cue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday . it is expected to have more rainf@@ alls all Saturday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floods after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to help the communities affected .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags have increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service allowed an additional 3 to 5 inch rain to fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday as it continued to rain in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that an up@@ stream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers are only slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the well @-@ worn rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest state on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still h@@ opped people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that the waters of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water poured in and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years when she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they stayed until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quickly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities consider evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer , near Liv@@ ing@@ stone , reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil has been considerably su@@ cked by rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ ins and floo@@ ding caused the rescu@@ ing of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua Par@@ ish and lessons in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a subsi@@ dy in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated into two churches that were both flooded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven animals washed by the flood .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the Municip@@ ality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to flood water and sand@@ bags prepared for residents to take part , hoping to keep the water from their houses and stores .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the City Government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses were reported as flooded on Thursday , but no reported on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police informed that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents reported that Brown suffered several shot injuries including in the l@@ ends , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in hospital with his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did a lot , his little body was en@@ um@@ er@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy shared the transmitter that he is expected to recover again .
he would have been to start the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical condition , reported the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just found out if one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge sleeves for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to different assault rif@@ les , over@@ se@@ wed the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
on the street , on both sides of the pav@@ ement , were leg@@ umes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di to the police station in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a qu@@ ag@@ ger on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police still looks for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine taking part in the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ asti@@ cs and that for more than one reason .
first of all I &apos;ve been with each summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three Tur@@ ner@@ ines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is a Catho@@ lic@@ in , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among the female female dancers was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ time world championships in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected , but master@@ ly gy@@ ms .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American who won gold at an individual multi @-@ competition event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the peak of this sport , but we don &apos;t see gymn@@ asti@@ cs classes all over the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ asti@@ cs are an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts are primarily associated with private gymn@@ asti@@ cs held by parents responsible for training , orientation , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these trainers are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ asti@@ cs .
we have to offer the municipalities au@@ n innumerable , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy accessible gymn@@ asi@@ um .
I founded my Turn@@ key for 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ asti@@ cs in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ asti@@ cs that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ asti@@ cs develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , which brings thousands of young girls to care for the gymn@@ asti@@ cs and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of Girl Power through the holding of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks for starting so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance physicians who voted for a vote rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend packages , in order to improve the care for hours of hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistance Doc@@ tors said last night in a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance physicians have still serious concerns regarding the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current mat@@ ernity crisis and treat it to treat all doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes caused by discussions to join the government on reluct@@ ance , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the case of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made for the last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to raise awareness and address the concerns of the assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistance doctors made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work trials .
the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in granting coverage to doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ end@@ ance for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , urged the assistance physicians to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working combat measures achieve nothing but little but strain already over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare the patient , car@@ egi@@ vers and their families only concerns , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we talked to the committee of the assistant doctors and responded positively to concerns about the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowing with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continuing positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training sessions , mutual recognition of the curriculum , further training and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks .
the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
approximately 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot loos@@ ens , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more prob@@ able .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased to be able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture leaves election fraud in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report because of corruption
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today disclosed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks police , election monitors and town halls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensi@@ tivities in respect of eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now a Ant@@ al King , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut @-@ off belts outside of elec@@ tive cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should have a passport to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently a vot@@ er has to name only his name and address .
the report suggests not to apply removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they give up their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to the community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves against electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture , which goes hand in hand with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ andal in East London .
last year , a special electoral court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor of Lut@@ sk was to be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; per@@ ver@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ig@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of im@@ itation in which one person sel@@ ects someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed in particular alar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent post@@ age - with the older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including the joining of cards to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; as evidence has been made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people , in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Lebanese background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... state institutions have unknow@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensi@@ tivities in regard to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition of political activists to process let@@ ter@@ dial documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harvest harvest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
non removable ink on the finger of a person use as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic review of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic stamp selection .
prohibition that political activists face full postal elections and envel@@ opes of postal elections .
the police give the authority to set up barriers to vote stations .
a amendment which facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Legisl@@ ative Act 1983 ) .
ban on photography in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the voting stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees generally enforce that voters walk alone in the electoral cab .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case there was no criminal complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court ruled Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons he was found guilty - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court judgment in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are advised by the French cycling activ@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who proved to be an impressive double @-@ go@@ ver to the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ad is by far not the only athlete with gold fighting athlete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one is allowed to believe in the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger on the racing track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison created a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I guess it is a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ wig Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big expressive eyes is said to be a double @-@ go@@ ver for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Ac@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another modest comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal swi@@ mmer Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a has more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American was att@@ ested by Nathan Adrian von fans to resemble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the simil@@ arities as well .
theory into space : according to this user there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter us@@ er@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons encomp@@ assed Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows at the final 4 x 200m free @-@ sty@@ ling staff@@ el for women : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese female has lost the union , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism of By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came fast and hard , where many were talking to him
Twitter users did not stay back when they heard how un@@ aware By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; shortly afterwards Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times among the people who responded to the Noti@@ ce on Twitter
the comment colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about the comments of Mac@@ Donald .
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not to them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s cre@@ ep in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was referring to the performance of the float and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the template , drew her own sto@@ cking trousers and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , nau@@ ghty as Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she liked nothing to get dressed and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone watching - or thinking about the person who under certain circumstances would buy the pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how reluct@@ antly to think that someone would take shelter with home , who had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull out the clothes from selling after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out her and didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Federation in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn your rob@@ ber around the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you approach you from behind , then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him then with his knee to the bar and twist , while the aggres@@ sor is bent before pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the gun on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight on the gun and strike the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the gun out of his grip , before moving backwards and directing the gun on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see how it performs Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est to transfer your money - if you are not Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sh@@ outs his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a guide
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ trac@@ ted his immune system and stran@@ gen@@ ess to a serious test , by putting some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the host and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ook off his course on a euro note , a ra@@ iling on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pur@@ ging button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before the removal of each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is getting involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to light .
the thought of le@@ aking the sink of a toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked out , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
from public money stations to stations to dish@@ washing buttons of toilets , the task definitely put his immune system under a test
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he did justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial score showed a lumin@@ ometric score of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number of newly washed hands amounts to less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick after their lumin@@ omet@@ res had more than 4000 units , while fresh washed hands were less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This comes close to the worst I have ger@@ o@@ cked in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not dock here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we carried out crazy Bra@@ in@@ stor@@ m@@ ings , which ended that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others , in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all sur@@ vey@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destro@@ ys front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ate social flat in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a dele@@ tion of £ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and their partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ port@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found ownership in an irre@@ parable condition .
the walls lined up holes , wooden floor@@ boards were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubri@@ cated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for home administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is believed to be regarded as not as beautiful as Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house that may be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , wooden floor@@ boards were pil@@ ed up
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing led her and her partner by force this week by force from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would sow the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were sum@@ mon@@ ed at regular intervals , for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown site of the community house , garbage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the last step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is considering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have bol@@ dly approached us and have provided us with the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the dele@@ tion on the ground .
workers of the administration will now have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don obtained a fine , after having found himself guilty of own@@ ing a drug of class B in merchant custody .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti with gra@@ ffiti .
the police say they will navigate rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall said that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ant who do not adhere to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without repro@@ aches and to those who were har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate any criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists visiting Portugal in panic after a bus@@ h@@ y military jet over@@ flies the beach
sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force killed an unbelievable rush flight
the air strikes stated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk .
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a bus@@ h@@ y jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost close to the sun worshi@@ ppers on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle mills without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that the jet flew lower than usual due to bad visibility conditions , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety was at no time com@@ promised .
land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland during the summer , where four people were killed on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly as low as possible because of the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which limits his view .
the plane was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify f@@ isher boats as part of the exercise .
super cup : Bar@@ ca with cares against Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting on Sunday for the first step towards the first win in the new football season .
the Catal@@ ans compete against the FC Sevilla in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , the re@@ play goes up three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ winner must refrain from eating with the subordin@@ ate Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reign@@ ing Europe League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
furthermore , Go@@ alie is missing Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
the German suffered a change in the knee during the training , which clari@@ fied the demand for bar@@ ca at least for the moment in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen have been competing in Barcelona for two years now .
coach Luis En@@ rique has refra@@ ined from a clear decision on this subject , leaving Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most other applications .
before the first mandatory game of the new season , there are doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the rehear@@ sal at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convinced .
Sevilla again has the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup to di@@ gest against Real Madrid and aims at the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in a dedicated league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; won the World Cup , World Cup , World Cup final tournament and just Olympia .
bronze passed to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ tig@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title to each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of Olympia was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record alone , between the sentences and in time outs they had no coaches .
they had withdrawn from the grand@@ stand and left their guns on their own in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve played the matches until here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fin@@ als I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists with the China flag posed .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight only in the first set with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent .
after that he determined the tempo at the top and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
nevertheless , there were still sufficiently stunning ballo@@ ons to be seen .
Mi@@ phi@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Russian had drawn a ri@@ b injury , was afterwards in medical treatment , had to settle &quot; in the end &quot; with sheet metal .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had become a similarly high table tennis legend Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tru@@ mp cle@@ ars up &quot; massive problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states to lose their majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now has weaknesses of his campaign in the former republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rare moment in which the Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire , which is usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident , expressed something like hes@@ itation , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after he threw 16 ri@@ vals inside his own republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of the evangel@@ ical Christian who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media .
scra@@ m@@ bling republi@@ can strongh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ ard in June , Tru@@ mp and his assistant were syn@@ onymous with the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not by the distance that is common for republi@@ can candidates in the state .
as endangered also Arizona and Georgia are considered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp replied to the question as to how to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I &apos;ll make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is all right , Tru@@ mp said .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party is said to have threatened to cut funds for the support of its electoral campaign , it should not be able to present any better survey values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the candidates of the Republi@@ can Repub@@ lic@@ ans will take stronger grip on the Congress . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympics : three @-@ step fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro State Olympics .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials informed that the earlier S@@ printer and current coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to Team Leader K@@ eni@@ as by dop@@ ing inspec@@ tors .
the IA@@ AF world association has searched the IO@@ C for information on the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , shared an IA@@ AF spokesperson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and has spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , released and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who stood on the list for training checks of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in Beijing in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days earlier , Ken@@ yan athletes Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was arrested on his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport .
in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing trials , Kenya has been under special observation for a long time .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it was usually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on African land before the summer Olympics in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya increased from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ up nation .
athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports the ARD repeatedly raised accus@@ ations that in Kenya dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sport fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he was employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that in this sport species has been rigor@@ ously structured and systematically structured .
Russia &apos;s athletes were ther@@ eu@@ pon excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth &apos;s dream with the role of Mary .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she re@@ members melanchol@@ y with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
it is therefore smart , naturally also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his gaze , it is his life !
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that &apos;s very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly topical : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the offer@@ tories came to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , reports have been reported in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family had learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and died shortly after her family , after having left the war @-@ torn country and returned to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good thing lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved in going into a war zone - people will ever think of ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from east London went to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then went to a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d says , Clinton will remain the candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of election victory in Gar@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gary &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell is in the opinion that the next president will appoint Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia the successor of the dec@@ eased judge in the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference calling Clinton to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expect Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later that he hadn &apos;t said with Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulates .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the US Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said that Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ land nom@@ ination , be Lak@@ ai@@ en and Hel@@ per Hel@@ per of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp .
he also noted Donald Tru@@ mp is un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants nu@@ cli@@ de calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women and for men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazin works with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked human beings , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distinguishes , because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that the Calendar also does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nude , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for the publication of the cal@@ endar@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork .
models can submit their images online or personally to an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the presi@@ dency of the Gü@@ len @-@ approaching Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kur@@ ds municipality in Germany is counting on tens of thousands of asylum seekers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh advance of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ ds community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already over@@ hau@@ led Kurdish strongh@@ olds with imp@@ eding months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous put@@ sch , secular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks were joined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that even absor@@ bs refugees , produced refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the association compla@@ ined about the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in the Algeri@@ an cities .
so Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a member of the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president demanded that the Federal Government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critics takes place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surf brand as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics for professional existence .
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ approaching Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on the figures published by the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum bene@@ fici@@ aries recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this figure was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people , and there@@ with nearly 29 per cent of all who have been eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey there are not those who wage war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. by the state side , individually persecuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote on the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 2021 , the Sunday election will not be resum@@ ed directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more stupid than ever it is not : summer holidays , heat and day @-@ elections - that bites .
the locals , who are to be persu@@ aded by the campaig@@ ners , are on vacation .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers in the country are on the road to U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so do not select the country &apos;s day .
there are practical problems : in the holidays there are hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , spread fl@@ yers and count on the end of the voices , only to apply pain@@ stak@@ ingly .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and final holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign briefly on the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ality .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old , and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one can see from his big posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as he did his legendary word @-@ car@@ er predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff .
otherwise , counsel@@ ing has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaigns at the wrong time .
she has twice invited German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; she is in the north @-@ east German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad not to listen to anybody from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U will largely wai@@ ve the usual election campaigns on market@@ places and before shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means co@@ co@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the Union has noticed that in the country it is crum@@ bling that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are going on like the Left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is little in the vast@@ ness of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ elec@@ tor Kok@@ ert on his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hurt , namely where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in p@@ olls , the Socialists and Democrats last reached 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the surveys , are likely to make the leap into the Land@@ tag .
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday hard@@ ship and largely transfer their electoral campaign to the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green elec@@ tors go to search for local vocal ch@@ ords among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and also finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : catering facilities suffer from blocking
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for construction work which begin at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at about 20 o &apos;clock , there is always praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no default .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the work in charge of the construction work is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to furnishing houses .
since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ fan@@ dingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg exists again , the traffic situation within the village was relaxed .
the citizens can now travel from O@@ fan@@ dingen to the B 27 on both sides .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alternative traffic through the place seems to be going back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some cases of considerable discomfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy director , Florian King , responsible for the traffic @-@ related management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ ws were looking for and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fran@@ ch@@ ising in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the congregation strengthened the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been fired .
the fastest was on the way with 77 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometres in the tempo @-@ 30 zone .
but since the construction site has been moved , it has become more quiet .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that the road is open again for customers from Rot@@ tenburg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to sales qu@@ arri@@ es , each one asks is scrut@@ ini@@ zed .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has little consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mil@@ eage is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the local restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him but all the restaurants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to be happy about every Euro turnover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue is offset to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the renovation of the street was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back for two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to let half of his staff have been dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , otherwise benef@@ iting from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now she must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something has been handled so much more gener@@ ously .
at all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
that other regular guests are now seeing less frequently due to the complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t get here , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
but G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that after the end of the restoration work his family @-@ clientele has come back .
despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on its clientele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly being screw@@ ed to laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not overwhel@@ m anyone .
other further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I am also involved in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was placed on results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has stopped a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security authority is to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU guidelines on passenger data and arm@@ aments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U man ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and also demands nothing , which in the case of the coalition partner do not have any chance anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
in some cases , they have in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the incar@@ cer@@ ation of people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should have their smartphones checked in advance and social media accounts for safety inspections are to be revealed .
in case of de@@ ple@@ tion for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than to date - such as commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to obsc@@ ure their identity .
some of them are political and legal .
some of them are still un@@ answered and can be answered questions .
and at some points - in the case of un@@ equal treatment of patients for example - the question arises : what actually has to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror .
but it can &apos;t be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees .
and things that pro@@ found@@ ly occupied people could not be cl@@ inging out in election campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inner security is enormous in the focus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral struggles .
on the subject of internal security , the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking position .
in the past few days , between the two parties , it was high .
only a gar@@ ner@@ ist dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the departments also demand a Bur@@ ka prohibition and a departure from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
from a departure from a double pass , he thinks nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have addressed the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ open it is not sensible .
and in the case of a bur@@ q@@ a prohibition , he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot in it , which could cause stri@@ fe .
but the SPD is currently attempting to gain inner security when it comes to internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel kindly sign@@ alizes the readiness to talk and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting off lightly .
despite diesel ski@@ ppers , the number of deliveries worldwide is rising .
but it does not run smoothly in all markets .
in the call@@ back @-@ action there is vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen launches in the second half of the year when deliveries are delivered .
despite its many brands and well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s largest car industry continues to show a plus thanks to its many brands and well @-@ run markets .
but in July , VW &apos;s core brand was weaker above all in Western Europe and again loaded the total sales as indicated in the D@@ ax company .
worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars in July .
in Western Europe , the second most important market in China alone , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the home market Germany deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
brand leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July especially to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a purchase reluct@@ ance in some core markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote was also bur@@ dened by the EU , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the US , where the exhaust gases first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus to beech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected household brand of the Lower Saxony is anyway getting off lightly by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales head Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance sales in January through July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software exhaust gas testing .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car shower represents a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate after the conversion , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason is legal fin@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted its German customers a guarantee for fully equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
the Ministry of Transport has confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that in the case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion , no deterior@@ ations will occur and all type approval @-@ relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility for customers to come to a workshop for example half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could result in the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in customer interest , it is important to avoid that in any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , it comes to uncertainty as to possible warranty regulations as it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires sufficient savings from savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see in it any signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savings should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear to pay for their as@@ par@@ ag@@ us pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; store banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fee applies to the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over € 100,000 on sight deposit or day money accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time , he has been keeping 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he could not exploit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and produce 0.4 percent of the costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he now continues to bear the costs of the poll@@ uter pays principle .
leaving the cash in the coff@@ ers of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer .
most customers should have understanding and change to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operative association Bayern stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry them alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their bank charges , credit cards or transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land have made head@@ lines with their skat@@ ebo@@ arding stores in 2014 with a penalty interest rate of € 3 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , so the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said on Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is somewhat more luxuri@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it hats for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently no longer known as any other banks that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold of going into the negative for private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is hard , and the migration of investors towards competition is threatening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the customers in Germany will not be pleased with that in the breadth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle ages love plates .
before you rush to the commentary arrow to sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of non @-@ all@@ ele men &apos;s middle age with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed revival of records is not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer group .
it is also not a hor@@ de by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older Platten@@ ko@@ purch@@ as@@ ers retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit before I stand , hold my hands and say something intimate like : &quot; so let &apos;s have a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o slowly collap@@ ses in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sal@@ es@@ men were resident - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to judge their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I run by Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men middle aged , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and once again buy objects he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records tend to be intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets on You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pump , people who heard about the com@@ eback and have decided to buy their old records again .
from the conversations that I have conducted , people usually get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores offer a comfor@@ ting community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers were offen@@ ded by the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some of the record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to reti@@ re to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , objects that evoke happy memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it &apos;s a simple way to get involved mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like her social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff of a record stack fl@@ aps out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t own record players .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned , while browsing through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of revival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came just recently and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ cally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , which only slowly come to life .
F@@ opp , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a more colorful audience than I go in .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - game of guest &apos;s newest synthetic and sex@@ tant pop , instead of experimental jazz , we@@ ars out of the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks odd but na@@ ï@@ ve psych@@ otic trau@@ mas are hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates for sale .
it &apos;s more like a shopping window than buying a big shopping cart .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives off with a loving si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record labels : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I preten@@ ding to be wearing jeans pants , I watched a group of young teen@@ age girls who group up for a moment to group Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research yiel@@ ded that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they leave , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with stro@@ lling through the record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates while they steer clear of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who worries about middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders .

French court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle of refugee camps
a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle where thousands of refugees live .
during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to submit 72 temporary businesses where individuals within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , offer hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would be a fire and san@@ itation risk .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp .
they also explained that temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are absolutely understandable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the breaks was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;@@ Café of the camp , which is operated profit@@ ably and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two help organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to date - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ appointing appearance in the Olympic season , amateur Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , stay confident and fight further , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he does not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly have a hard time commenting on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyse in peace which reasons had led to de@@ bac@@ le .
at the FIFA World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who had lost 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes to the Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Bear@@ er
Germany &apos;s rac@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed sensor : in different federal states , including Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash units are tested , which should be particularly effectively transferred to Tem@@ pos@@ ün@@ der .
the futur@@ istic en@@ rol@@ ment tra@@ ilers of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident sites , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example on highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary tem@@ polishing , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is maintained with a stationary bl@@ ender .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
reinforcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans according to time , travel stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
the trailer is able to move in a highly frequ@@ ented state according to the manufacturer with every car with trailer hit@@ ch .
in order that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measurement mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also van@@ ish @-@ safe outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain reco@@ vers silver in the 7 @-@ s ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji Master@@ class reco@@ vers gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odor@@ o stage .
Fiji issued a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic med@@ als of any color .
the defeat was defeated by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fiji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it &apos;s unlikely that at least a Br@@ ite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago , they lost every game in the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan .
here they lost only one .
this flap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fiji started wonderful and allowed G@@ Bs to boun@@ ce out of fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au sm@@ ashed in the corner .
with only four minutes of play , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he changed .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a t@@ weak@@ ing T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell hal@@ ted the mount of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but Fiji has only stopped .
in the seventh minute , Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a placed a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the game of rein@@ car@@ nation and there was still more than a minute of playing ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u stressed by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning .
this is how it is .
GB brought fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua went through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play from Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an experiment for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South se@@ ein@@ ate , whose fans sang , flags and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame made the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced , and GB nod@@ ded devastating in the law@@ ns .
in the past , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als of 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a scar@@ ce semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton crossed the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ side team , secured the win - and therefore the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ ini@@ al gold than these games and that will be what will be called .
from the first strokes to the last , 220 tough p@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was all present when they rowed to the second Olympic champion in the two without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports , who laid such a benchmark .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ protected use , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lets that gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and no one was as an aid as the coach who did not know about 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ked .
I had bladder cancer which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treating early 2014 , out of season , which kept the break down to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again .
it was an incentive .
I was hospit@@ alized and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning a bit more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that might be a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I have worked , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we wouldn &apos;t be anybody , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked myself a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with .
even in the last 500 meters , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t able to do something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary for clarity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 31 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small fr@@ inge drinking water utility as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago it was called in the original on a contribution of Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
a little later the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia stran@@ gled the purpose of the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was a member of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband workforce for 31 years , 28 years as Managing Director .
he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , transports approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply agreements for other cities and municipalities .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ eller was appointed Wasser@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational skills , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the elevated tanks ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial refurb@@ ishment of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and you have always added new things because water is life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dati@@ o she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived up to the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group to the nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller on his part praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ man and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view he described the well construction and re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ation of the purpose association .
however , the biggest challenge and the har@@ dest use were the pi@@ ping in the high tank near Kirch@@ berg on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brunn can be maintained only once , because it was filled with hoses from P@@ ett@@ stadt .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
when the disease was recognized with her son , she believed that she must die .
but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now learn to learn in New York , where there are the best therapists .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots on partner
on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ m@@ n ) on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him will be publicly remembered .
meanwhile nationwide because Sven S. could be travelling with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
in the meantime , the man carries a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still wear the weapon , so the police .
those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the competent police in Lü@@ beck did not want to make any information about the tap or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , she confirmed that a human being was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say any more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains at the release from the Renew@@ able Energi@@ es Con@@ ver@@ gence to the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ stream production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the German steel industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission following talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent is assumed .
but even these are not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for self @-@ producing electricity .
in this way , the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined .
the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emission rights trade , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to exac@@ erb@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer of China was forcing mort@@ al steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers are throwing price dump@@ ing on Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a little .
on the one hand , imposed import duties show impact on import steel , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have bri@@ gh@@ tened up .
it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp wanted last but not to exclude clos@@ ings of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers will remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Economy division announced on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced crowd went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
thanks to an improved order situation , the association expects an increase in output in the coming months .
community , Spirit , Health : singing Do@@ es Sen@@ iors Good
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in the Leh@@ ra@@ mt degree she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old is singing in a senior ensemble .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says .
by the way , she is doing something good for her health and her spirit .
S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors right from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures are dissolved , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
this is because senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
those who demand his lungs regularly will not get out of the pu@@ ddle in everyday life even in everyday life .
even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older people often have a very special effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ursula L@@ enz von der Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Senioren @-@ Organis@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher value , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth time .
through song texts and especially melodies , people themselves deny themselves to long @-@ lying events .
when singing , the head is also required to perform a particular performance , explains L@@ enz .
to concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and to a given rhythm while adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone practice not only concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler thinks .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I practise for something for a long time , I will get better and wake up beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing are therefore enough .
if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate , even if he thinks you have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes next ?
if you are looking for a suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir , you can simply join .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly .
many senior choirs can also be found on the internet .
if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help in the internet search .
whoever wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to every age .
cats respond more sensi@@ tively than cr@@ aters to the scre@@ ams of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover about what effect the rep@@ ut@@ ations of cat babies have on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ sty also did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of cat babies at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond to tens of percent faster than k@@ itt@@ ens who have found themselves in great need , as scientists have found themselves out of the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
she is the author of the study published on Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the caus@@ tic scre@@ ams differ with the ur@@ gency of their depen@@ dency .
a total of nine adult males and eight female males were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they played a whi@@ p of little ones who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of more strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers maintain their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said .
they turned faster to the driver , when this rep@@ ut@@ ations were played by the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises several times .
also , some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , no matter whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Super@@ cup &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match is held in Turkey .
in front of the Du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even with the susp@@ ecting of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government , the daily routine of normal citizens , was not affected .
this does not apply to those suspected of being responsible for the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
there is no halt before the football .
against the former Stark@@ ie Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant .
according to this , the Sü@@ kü@@ r living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kü@@ r is said to be supporters of Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
it is true that the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact it has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into tra@@ ilers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the pres@@ idents of the President .
but what unites the plot of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts .
even the fans themselves agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially returned to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at 17 gates and nine templates in all cont@@ ests , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as a top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record masters found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the Pre @-@ Round K.@@ o in the Champions League the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South Li@@ g only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we have done and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year of the game was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ch king .
this is also the reason that fans hope to continue on the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , bor@@ rowed from the AC Florence under the contract and announced to Bes@@ ik@@ tas after the attempted coup attempt , did not return to his European holiday on account of the political situation in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in order to do so , the storm would have to be ready to give up to approximately one @-@ third of its annual growth of 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man realized : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have med@@ als at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year old Justi@@ n Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had lam@@ ented her start right before the games after a dop@@ ing block , was kno@@ cked out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
it offered a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a raised smile she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
as a stand@@ still that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ rush .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Justi@@ n Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster than ever before , he is the number one in the world over 100 metres in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the greatest challen@@ ger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to shut off a six @-@ month lock after taking the anal@@ ges@@ ics of Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after surgery , she had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defending herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Champion was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the inqu@@ isi@@ tive intake and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion of more than 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement has been responsible , mut@@ ated mer@@ gers .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ a ) : hardly an athlete was recognised as many med@@ als afterwards .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title in 2005 nine years later after he found testosterone dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand over Olympic silver in 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also recognized the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a ruling of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the World Ranking List .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record chan@@ cell@@ or and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , indications of taking a forbidden dietary supplement have been found , the barrier of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA dropped and expi@@ red on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokesperson for the foreign ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered from cutting and had been treated at the hospital , but I can leave it again .
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
whether the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also affected Austrian citizens are still unclear .
the State Department is in constant contact with local authorities , such as waste .
the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok , was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a b@@ ough of two bombs .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans .
on Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and another man was killed according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured during the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach of Pat@@ ong , which was popular among holi@@ day@@ makers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explosive rate had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally , some det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ east coast required several injuries .
one gets out of a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bombing of bombs carries the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ or@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves about possible motives - but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks that is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities have kept secret references to forthcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however , they have not been informed of the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police told their officials all over the country to strengthen security surrounding important government buildings , airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they usually do not target tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used over the years by Thai King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai safety authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence also in the coming years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country walks towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , is committed to keeping the kingdom restored to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok , 20 people were killed in a stroke on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ t@@ arian Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several national offices , the conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the federal government have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence of efforts against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the German Press Agency , Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ier , of the German Press Agency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , in an extrem@@ ist way , migrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East will be de@@ fam@@ ed .
that is why we watch the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ t@@ ären . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely aligned with the government &apos;s offices in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief executive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the ties Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertising slogan for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible to violence .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there have been reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ t@@ ären &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several German states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t have any findings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the protection of the constitution , possible contacts of this species are only relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not evident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a look at the significant increase in right @-@ wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , he said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing terrorist structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ taler group .
it may well be that further right @-@ wing groups or small groups are planning to plan the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other extrem@@ ist motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism cannot be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous groups were born on the regional level or in social networks .
concerned Ma@@ ate expressed concern that many attacks went to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the suspi@@ cious attacks on asylum seekers have previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , have radi@@ cal@@ ised by far @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympic Games or world records do not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center the slightly over@@ wei@@ ghted s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia sw@@ am so slowly that it was temporarily no longer visible in the TV @-@ pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ ré was subsequently used for the viral interaction .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty character that drew the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethi@@ op@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more familiar .
since most sports@@ men are walking in Ethiopia , I just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ uble of whale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined about him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m fre@@ estyle , played no part .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; have also been drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i run media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
unforgettable was the performance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to sail alone in a race over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim for eight months before Olympia and had never taken such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ et@@ s@@ ried - The owner of a shop in the new place has been scre@@ ened .
according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ et@@ s@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left their business on Monday against 5.@@ 30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor .
when they returned the next morning at 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock , about 250 Euro had disappeared from the cas@@ hier .
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
there is no video monitoring available .
Tru@@ mp does not see the im@@ pending election defeat so tight
the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tru@@ mp is speaking at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp is already an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t care for him : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ can in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CN@@ BC .
if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is all right , said Tru@@ mp .
thus he called US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance formed .
post increases in trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the mail plans to sell her electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter also .
the Group wants to start trade with the transpor@@ ter shortly .
the postal service wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters from the next year on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to increase sales to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they will be delivered to their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and par@@ c@@ els are to be sold , even to other companies .
post @-@ Management Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always questioning , such as by craftsmen .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn company will shortly enter mass production of vehicles .
in the post @-@ factory factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and long @-@ run a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we are converting the whole fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter is active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP @-@ management starts after dis@@ appointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the cuts came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research firm Gf@@ K made it clear that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uns@@ af@@ e , the longer the achievements promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research firm Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ appointing business figures and the resignation of the corporate management , the global number five of the industry faces a new beginning .
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already reti@@ res from the Supervisory Board effective September 12 .
as early as September 1 , the management board of the Executive Board will take up the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , who informed the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann is found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the long @-@ term business orientation as a reason for the feedback . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company spokes@@ man on Friday did not want to call details .
it is still unclear who will lead the market research company in future .
in the event of investor circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders were last the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring initiated years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit in 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are still not to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it were the case with BMW , that would do the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have to stop its loss of losses even in the second quarter of 2016 .
with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros declined by 3.4 percent in the first half of the year .
in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter has weighed heavily on the value of the company .
the loss of EUR 139 million in the Consumer Experience business segment posted a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million under the line .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into slices in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n : eight injured
in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , told the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade an opposite vice , which partly ro@@ de on the counter @-@ lane .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the crash site on the state road 2 .
the last travellers were brought back from a regular bus back to the P@@ ew@@ sum district .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and witnesses to sign up with the police .
the fees per cubic meter of sewage from October 1 , 2016 for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 euros ( up to now 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( up to now 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the waste water fee will increase again at the latest , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , it was determined by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach Office of the H@@ ousing Administration that there is shelter for these sewage installations .
due to legal grounds , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems at a cost @-@ saving manner .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens as well as industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ ding , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the wall@@ ets .
the fee increases lie between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt presented the panel , a new calculation of the charges for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ covers from the previous calculation period are also to be compensated .
in all three wastewater facilities , Schmidt founded the company &apos;s grave bre@@ aches in order to handle relatively small facilities with a very low waste water waste , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic metres per year .
for example , due to the low distribution base , expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly declining .
furthermore , in the previous calculation period in all three systems , renovation and repair costs have fallen to a considerable extent , not least due to their age .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ ding , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years old .
Schmidt indicated that in the waste water system Az@@ endorf had to replace the mechanical ventilation system due to damage .
after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be disman@@ tled , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation possible to comply with the water regulations in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water , expenses for operation and maintenance were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully penet@@ rated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs , has been spar@@ ed during the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the opinion of stone houses in the long run , especially since the supply area of the sewage treatment association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal cannot be extended by these facilities because it is in deficit .
Bulgaria de@@ books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were booked .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 0.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
the prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education remained unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , revol@@ ving tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps come to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critici@@ zed in the past in which they were accused that the App Black@@ face would promote or propag@@ ate white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week suggested some users a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , wrong teeth and evap@@ or@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they asked if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and the ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter reminded of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others declined the anim@@ e comparison .
in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet about the photos became widespread , that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and said to be uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face has been drawn into the de@@ fle@@ cted extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in our hands .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents - might tend to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and a telephone interview , she said that she believes that rapid controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the Sn@@ ap@@ chat control practices .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chin@@ es@@ ich @-@ ameri@@ can Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a human resource responsible focusing on under@@ represented populations and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu also said that she will be closed to her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military command fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS secret service information , establishes committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , which allowed the actual conditions on site to be reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Defence Forces , secret services committees and the military budget report , reports of great dis@@ content under Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence agencies typically pic@@ tured by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders marked a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions were allowed on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; noted Ken Cal@@ vert , a republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ Com are reaching to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government tips have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superior , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin already in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command &apos;s leaders changed the intelligence reports to bring down the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force into life after being admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed with more detailed insights while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence .
the democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can task force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; stated the highest @-@ ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ amed the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of having found evidence of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st regarding a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political view &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress &apos;s investigations were published on Tuesday through The Daily Be@@ ast .
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , who were contacted by Cent@@ Com analy@@ st complaints .
L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these key issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have further effects on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of the depen@@ dencies of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw only a small occupation force in Iraq and refused to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker states that contrary to the statements by the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State could have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this knowledge , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s dam@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US winning fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain is ahead
one day after they shot three doors during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , they know that the American women are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will conver@@ ge on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two will get the first and second place in their group from six teams .
the first placed will take the strong Holl@@ änder a little longer out of the way that the other group leads .
however , as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising whi@@ rl@@ wind through their success story , four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the last London Games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey player in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , a coach of the national team , began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have ro@@ cked the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the doors in the first half of the game with a return from the near area .
India was gone into play without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and put the ball in the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a goal in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , as late as it is , the Olympic Games are .
the Rio de Janeiro events feel constantly and unavoid@@ able , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff , which is handed down from the Cross@@ bow to the swi@@ mmer to the tur@@ ner for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the waiting queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ opol@@ y or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dim@@ ples , could well have been built under these well @-@ known names , which would be sent to Prime Time , by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV ads , if he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports which are not generally recognized : air pi@@ stol@@ len , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swimming and may have a long rule .
but if I should show arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the jumping on the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ se noticed the last 16 years that many of them , I asked , did not know that it is an Olympic portal at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes for competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and has had an athlete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans who are responsible for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London .
jumping on the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider , partly because it is suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the sound for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending collision - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ asti@@ cs and diving , the two sports that essentially unite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympic programme , they are assessed by performance , degree of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight .
med@@ alli@@ sts in their quest for gold have to go farther , faster , upward and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall , but also a further highlight in the television broadcast : those of the world or the Olympic Stadium .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I consider to be a bit ti@@ res@@ ome when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the women &apos;s qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of the Olympic Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the Ang@@ us and the objectiv@@ ity of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his new fan base .
&quot; a generation prot@@ esting &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia clas@@ h@@ ed with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during coll@@ isions with police at gun@@ ners .
is Ethiopia struggling to break with it ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sha@@ ken the country and spread in more and more areas .
last week , thousands of people r@@ ushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s answer was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
circul@@ ating videos about the protests that are probably the last or the beginning of this year show how security people strike young people with sticks while forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now asking for a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethi@@ op@@ ians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression through the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or detention , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in terms of power of the governing coalition .
after a pro@@ vision@@ ally critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions along the border to Erit@@ rea are rising ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which have been forced more or less in recent years , can benefit from turbul@@ ence and be re @-@ armed .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of falling under the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
it is only in recent years that many Ethi@@ op@@ ians were able to communicate through the social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government obstruc@@ ts access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they are staying .
several young Ethi@@ op@@ ians gave up that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who predominantly come from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in flat land areas .
but that also changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos areas .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 per cent of the population , which are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was the Ethi@@ op@@ ian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was especially vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia witnessed such uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 after thousands of elections prot@@ ested that the government was apparently fu@@ elled by the government and then stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters have been killed even if it was less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters attacked in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ bit@@ an city , led by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flüge over the neighboring Somalia , although it recently concluded that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse into an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his statement Obama had founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign , fear@@ ing that his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , would be the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication gave rise to new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly to the American public .
it also brings his comrades who make an effort to protect him during an event@@ ful phase in order to explain to the peculiar position he could not have meant .
after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp returned in terms of alle@@ gation on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to suggest that he had created IS@@ IS , the President and Mrs. Clinton .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation perfectly serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing of it .
the last storm of criticism r@@ att@@ les Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand values .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp again tried to reverse this issue .
on Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestion would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp was already in defence of sar@@ cas@@ m .
at the end of July , he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I said that sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; clear &quot; according to what the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert observing the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp assumed an even more corro@@ sive tone , as his survey values went further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a great lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ at @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp generally tries to ap@@ olog@@ ise for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor .
but while he emphas@@ ises the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may also be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mps most prominent advoc@@ ates , was struggling to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said , so he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mps about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ t@@ ellers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans attempt to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread herself aggres@@ sively under control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being ro@@ aming at each of his words and being taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked Mr. Tru@@ mps &apos;s ap@@ ology as just a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
to be pushed over the market price , Café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ oted café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store were disp@@ elled .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie shop , which was replaced in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people were drunk as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excep@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is also new invention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north from its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he began to work at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide funds for a new outside office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nish such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onions .
there are natural treasures .
the café no longer serves beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also disp@@ elled by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after the verb was closed she gave up the coffee drinking a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was on coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a loyal customer since the start of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before the work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal is still receiving his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for decor@@ ating with the coff@@ in bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;ll go back to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he has prepared to put them out soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the site also has further advantages .
a local juice local would like to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee in the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the President Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roosevelt had a fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ at@@ essen on Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was slightly more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es &apos;s last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was the Chinese kitchen in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; An decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small , fast food in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the re@@ porter ordered hack@@ ers , this found the couple suitable for discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretched the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E sm@@ iled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ Buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; marks the way in which the country went to no longer be the land of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new diet was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food residue , &quot; Ziegel@@ man noticed , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the focal point of American cuisine for years , became a rarely ser@@ rated luxury .
odd mixtures were tried , as a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the domestic business recipes .
like never before or since , budget econom@@ ists - among them Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 , drove the country &apos;s eating habits like this .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeping women &quot; and the challenge of becoming fair as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially tasty are the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke as the million @-@ million@@ aire man of the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a smo@@ king .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully real@@ ism alien .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if his wife , Ele@@ an@@ or , would have asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hypo@@ cris@@ y of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt made that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back on its legs .
the legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food , &quot; Ziegel@@ man said , &quot; as well as how science was applied to food .
in writing the book , the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the incident .
after the plates were removed at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said and added that it was a nasty trick to miss a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everybody un@@ willingly showed a spoon in the t@@ ame , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
aston@@ ish@@ ingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ E picked up three times a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bombing attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives to others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old even died at a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group which , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 60,000 people alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to help in the war zone first aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian prot@@ ector , showing him with a 11 @-@ hour rescue from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die in saving lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four tanks over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb so that no children can play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture rec@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland has only 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k is floating along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1,@@ 220 metres wide .
only when it matters , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
however , this lifestyle em@@ bos@@ sed by slow@@ ness seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate by a Greenland hai who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life @-@ span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolution@@ ist thought for a long time that Greenland will become st@@ ony .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are hard to observe , after all they live mainly in the Eis@@ meer in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures of the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter at the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland sh@@ arks .
their slow @-@ pent@@ ines measured them , when they with@@ held six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitz@@ bergen .
nevertheless , these sh@@ arks make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
maybe they hunt asleep animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ches from higher water layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the l@@ enti@@ sts of the sh@@ arks using the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucleus .
their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons attempt to sp@@ ill larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal , with 220 centimet@@ ers in length , the l@@ enti@@ sts , on the other hand , contained a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons tests , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their liner core , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers could assign an age to the length .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers was probably at the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously can be at least one and a half centuries time .
this should also be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us @-@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland w@@ al , in which bac@@ on on the neck had a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on tip , was captured in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame of as@@ par@@ ag@@ us .
so they later mature - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Sch@@ euer@@ lein evolution@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal , on the other hand , should rather invest its resources in a long life .
construction site in double pack
the municipal council has focused on topics related to building construction in the most recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board accepted the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after clari@@ fying the land , par@@ o@@ ing and closing questions and the applications for sur@@ veying , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - expansion section 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au appeal to young families and young sen@@ iors in equal measure .
as it was said , they can announce themselves in the town hall from now on . the municipal council is expected to give advice on the allocation of the plots in its September session .
in order to also find inquiries for the reloc@@ ation of other commercial companies , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the newly created surface protection plan in sub @-@ areas only in the spring of this year .
in the Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n area , the industrial area , which has already been designated there , is extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the City of Frankfurt therefore has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether bor@@ eh@@ ouses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval in Britain has been sufficient for them so far .
they just use large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , re@@ affir@@ ms the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk corporate ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector , but as well as Dublin dis@@ covers the infrastructure .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
in addition , the city is equipped with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the management consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city will be ranked 7th , Luxemburg on No@@ .@@ 19 , Dublin on No@@ .@@ 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial hub for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , the econom@@ ist .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
an American magi@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ te C liti@@ gation with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , related to block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the complaint was lifted on Thursday , US Secretary of Defense Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead was entitled to bear the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to con@@ verse with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck used to acc@@ use each other and claim ownership on laboratory work , which is based on Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the US say they have reg@@ ained complete control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained complete control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , said a spokes@@ man for the group on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are going through the city after the ex@@ odus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , shared by Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters , allied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s revenues earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
on Friday , H@@ illary Clinton published their tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton posted nearly USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ shares ; the former Minister for Foreign Affairs gave an income of USD 3 million to her book about her term in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , co @-@ auth@@ ored his wife Anne Hol@@ ton with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a blat@@ ant contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , even though they are not oblig@@ ated by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax inspection by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Democrats candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mps Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before tax inspections are not finished .
Tru@@ mps critics , among others , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal issues regarding assets , his donations for charitable organizations , his business ars and various other links , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and posted a video on the Internet on Friday , asking the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp to publish his tax return .
on Thursday , she also addressed the issue during a speech to the business in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what each other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Politi@@ co has reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp did not pay only very little taxes for two years , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that this could still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial glomer@@ ate here has his seat , tru@@ mp to a meeting to exchange their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had been subjected to a tax inspection of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return until 2007 .
the Clinton &apos;s , who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these only pay USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most Americans .
its principal investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues were tax@@ ed by USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fireworks support Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant guard
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ci@@ li@@ pu@@ bic .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea years ago , has intensified their promotion along with the U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the international calling day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities , with much more confidence that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; vo@@ iced the director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dami@@ an Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spray fine dust on bili@@ pu@@ des into the air .
a touch quite usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
a final option represents a thro@@ wer that shoots a gold @-@ dre@@ amer into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
municipal coun@@ cill@@ or unanim@@ ously decides : no new building at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects with K@@ us@@ sh@@ und accept investment projects - especially the retail sector in the core city is considered to be clearly exp@@ and@@ able .
the municipal council , however , unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the construction of a commercial sky on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ kon@@ s in the construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we welcome new businesses , but at this location on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director beats Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pres@@ election since it had requested Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; issued his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann attempted to find Israel on the list of country code lists .
the country , however , was not listed between countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how did it happen in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ wered him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cited by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and dis@@ ma@@ yed .
this really is very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big response on the Internet where people called it a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ate the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged demands of the Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , stands next to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly referred to all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to include Israel in the fast @-@ dial list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
added that the country code is now added .
police puts tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students joined the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public educational system .
the police deployed tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to police firing of rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the proposals of the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the protest participants saw Gra@@ ffi@@ tis spra@@ yed against the preliminary president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trading rate between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been abol@@ ished , the interest of Russian companies in the country grew strongly , the ambassador said .
Russian companies are taking up existing links with Iran while new firms are willing to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial exploitation is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade recovery was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan leaves Russia for a record number of Iranian tourists this year .
last year , Russian foreign representation was about 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries regarding the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said .
witnesses sought : inf@@ ar@@ ction of beverage market in forest seed oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening was performed on the beverage market by Re@@ we XXL at Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , picked up cash from the beverage store staff and then fled at first on foot and then presumably with a silver coloured VW Golf .
how much money has been exploited does not share the police with them .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres tall , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly accessible from the Re@@ we market .
the perpetr@@ ators must be stra@@ pped in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel parking space lying opposite the parking lot with the silver coloured car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations about the crime time ( at 19.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during the summer break
eight beautiful and joyful days spent the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers at their summer free time in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
at the quietly situated Freizei@@ tzentrum hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ len the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first school holiday week .
several full @-@ day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to B@@ rescu@@ ing with the visit of the stro@@ zh@@ z@@ oos .
on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group was delighted with the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and p@@ add@@ ling .
children and car@@ ers were treated to culinary delights such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and the Bolog@@ n@@ ese T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops there was b@@ ati@@ fied , beautiful jewels created from beads and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot;
on the day of the journey home the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
H@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Do@@ ge of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral unit E@@ fin Valley @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , St. Anna , travelled to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage to Freiburg .
four stages were met together .
in order to bridge the time to the next Rom@@ s@@ ine ride of all the mini @-@ regi@@ stran@@ ts in the period of two years , the senior minist@@ erial circular St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and his children , rose up in the way .
in the evening before , Fr . Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration at St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage and shared the Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s blessing .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er loved woman stood and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was res@@ igned from Münster .
the individual day tours were surrounded by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts in the morning and evening .
but also on the way , the min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly made R@@ ast to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song .
for the nights , the par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were at their disposal .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided for a tasty and stren@@ uous dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we continued on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next day was the stage after St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at first heated heat had to be desc@@ ended some 500 metres in altitude and then climbed again .
the deserved reward in the evening was a common BBQ on the badge .
after the morning impulse on the fourth pilgri@@ m &apos;s day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to the final leg to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and went through the gates of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was given thanks .
the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t was welcomed at the evening Mass in Münster .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner r@@ ushes home , when Br@@ ite won gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in a men &apos;s team Sprint at the velo@@ drome in Rio to fame when the British team was defending the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own . the J@@ umping and made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory of New Zealand &apos;s favor@@ ites .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they catch only a modest sixth place in London in March at the London Underground World Championships in London .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a sign .
Ho@@ ys retired had a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who were four years ago with Ho@@ y defeated - and Sk@@ inner put in the qualification round a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders prevailed in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was scar@@ ce after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that was going on in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and noticed Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an olymp@@ ic ch@@ ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 Triumph at the site Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der said that after a weak start he intentionally desc@@ ended to the train .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s rival .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the Great Britain flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have been working as a team in the last three months .
we came so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
this would be the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be struck to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race .
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will be focusing on safety .
he had been argu@@ ing yesterday with officials prior to the qualification , when function@@ aries were calling him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will continue tomorrow and end , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand@@ , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong web @-@ based team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a tro@@ op of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary illustration of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
drama was played in the background , such as the resignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April amid sex@@ ism and murder charges and retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , when one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velo@@ drome , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the removal of the energy yield question@@ able
the future of the Port@@ land aluminium melt in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract and thus will lift all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , not giving any further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy , which is scheduled for 20 years , will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa facility in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2,000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the sm@@ el@@ ting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt &quot; , &quot; said the company .
AG@@ L also said that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which will be effective as of November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to the income in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the revenue to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in the &quot; expectation of cancellation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to exp@@ el the contracts , to operate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not impaired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who would have come into force this year , even if it is still a declaration of why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn of the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements by the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually consum@@ es around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and tomato about 900 MW of electricity .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to weeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , shared reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z uncle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é @-@ hai@@ red plot of almost every birthday episode of a child show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to leave her other girls somehow in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , certainly a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ an has begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her beating the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the journal is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles more of an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the newspaper 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still se@@ ep before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who like fashion &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence in 2013 was on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enny &apos;s success does not like everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers has always been a bit ten@@ se in the world of fashion .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret Model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised them and called them &quot; the Mi@@ st@@ ings of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings sounded high again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but lying around on the mis@@ e seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertisement for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ée Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her own pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is to be seen in Reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
Centr@@ es Centr@@ es annually al@@ locate 160@@ ,000 people
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary units are rejected annually by the municipal centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further medium cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ants and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly frequ@@ ented , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centers will lose further 30 percent of their funds .
the Director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people are already rep@@ u@@ di@@ ated each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would be even worse without a suspension of the federal government &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s Common Fac@@ ts are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with uns@@ ur@@ passed and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been wrong@@ ly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we urge the General Prosecutor and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these funds so that the people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customer communities and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp election campaign accused of det@@ ain@@ ing workers
new York : Donald Tru@@ mps campaign was charged with alleged in@@ action after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a gun to a staff while travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bhagavan gave up for months to have been waiting for the matter to be controlled internally before realizing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the campaign , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mmed the run in Vincent &apos;s knee eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the charge only came two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate had triggered a rebellion when he said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm @-@ owners and weapon @-@ friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and judge judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mps campaign clearly stated that the media would have ri@@ pped its words out of context and that it would not inc@@ ite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ordin@@ is Com@@ pla@@ int requests damages from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and by Philip for bodily injury and lasting psychological damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mps Press spokes@@ man Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to contact Philip as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
responding to calls to his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has so far led a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before EU elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , substantial losses for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties are notable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this revealed representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the North could just continue to go@@ vern , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party , and would have a good chance to continue to pose the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD crashed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party is just barely ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in parliament .
despite a slight loss of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens entered the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent each .
according to the survey , the SPD , according to the survey , is only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they thus still smile behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left at 15 percent ( previous 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ uties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pirates would not miss it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was quite cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would now suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the western pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could set a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax to reach the communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , albeit very slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was very proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , that is about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile phone business experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft .
today , the market is dominated by suppliers who came all much later than Nokia .
be online anytime and anywhere , which is today for a lot of people &apos;s everyday lives .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion Smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , an entire industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the crucial breakthrough on the mass market was launched at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet Communic@@ ator , everything easy to use by touch screen .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ al procession began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the look .
they disappeared eventually , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks for 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to push the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , who is responsible for staff at the Siemens Management Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me this represented the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ throw , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
for our local communities , we will already have 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs , and youth unemployment in the airport environment will end .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that will think that the challenge of enlargement is too great .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ bling on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong also at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in community growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have implemented a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion of expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the 2012 London Olympics were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking
for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software producers , there are attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block scor@@ ing on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the coding on his advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of what part of the page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her fight between the open source community and the conver@@ ters has been in progress since the invention of sign@@ atories , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered into the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying advertisements for the industry have become .
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , we use approximately 200 million people display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks .
the company has opted for ad block@@ ers on Desktop PCs since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on the mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on Desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient amount of income , so Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &apos; ad preferences pool &apos; to give people more control over it targeted advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that add blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have instead focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to get more control over people &apos;s hands .
woman in presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call on witnesses after a woman was driving on a highway in the early hours of the morning with a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman laid down in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was transferred from several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she still died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police who asked these as well as any witnesses of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter told the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the public prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers must not assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after having transferred and killed a man who lay in August 2014 on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious in the street , took the judgment .
the court noted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- responding to an emergency call -- ro@@ de on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable according to projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have met similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and yet turned on slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably indicated more dry areas than earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus benefited also from a sun , which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rot@@ ational speed of Venus is exposed for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that had previously been suspected of planetary scientists .
although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their steam was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen declined , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy performs as a coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy retired on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy commented in a statement .
in the course of the summer I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needed it and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
it must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the league .
he led the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years the night season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference to score five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
North American workers resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles with regard to wages for North Sea oil workers are exposed , while all con@@ ten@@ ders sit at the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT Trade Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the process of the present strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold several full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks that will begin the beginning of next year in order to tackle the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contra@@ ctions in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s rat@@ chet is followed by a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has dismissed thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and in the whole country we need an economy that works for many and not only a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in star cluster to different rates , and in which context the rotation periods are associated with the creation of planets .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star @-@ enh@@ ancements , we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the Earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now the fastest .
at peak rotation rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars meet large amounts of star@@ vation .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star @-@ spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massi@@ vely stars revol@@ ve more slowly than a few massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars revol@@ ving slower than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the P@@ lei@@ ades Ballet , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
we want to learn more about how the How , When and Why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak , hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the web press rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades that will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears run at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional return announcement , the 41 year old professional will wear the Tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game atten@@ dee of the Major League bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid off with performance for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es made some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be recorded in the hall of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 banned ster@@ oids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ Genesis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida for years .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends have survived the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win every game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the circumstances with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , got the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ arch@@ rival Boston red so@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the supporters at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland cannot start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
a well @-@ caught athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing incidents have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre barrier runner in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Military Tribunal CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth in the fin@@ als over 100 m of butter@@ flies , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the events of over 50 m of fre@@ estyle .
at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the IO@@ C has applied for the opening of the B sample and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter very seriously and demands full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S , is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news spread about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive herself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substance should be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B test should also be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly spoke with criticism of the athlete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why sports@@ men do not pull the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dou@@ bling nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positive for three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both deny the intake , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association banned the entire Russian team up to one exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , including the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya producing numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the previous off@@ ences in China had also caused fierce disputes between athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also stood at the centre of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive for the Chinese nation@@ als in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant of the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de , but only a three @-@ month lock had to be removed .
data lau : so per@@ fi@@ de her@@ mits h@@ acker their ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mailing software currently target companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey by malware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , partly victim of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software , according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially inj@@ ected ran@@ som is significantly higher than for private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was sc@@ ary in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the victim &apos;s computer , it seeks to search for unused files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the end turn code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of coin currency Bit@@ coin .
but where private users have the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of affected German companies reported turnover losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even had to break down business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients may be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , get their data again .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the hack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in an up @-@ to @-@ date study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail users and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their cas@@ u@@ alties via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , address freely accessible support sites , or deci@@ ph@@ er free sample files for free .
and if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit amounts in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively low @-@ risk profits from Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share work , says security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the SO@@ PH@@ OS antivirus provider : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programmers sell their malicious software then in the form of a software kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the malware kits have been created so that malware itself , advice and additional tools have been purchased for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the delivery includes an adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail then searches for other hack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one logs in one of the forums on the background , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is carried out on an infected machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better safeguard their data .
over 50 percent of respon@@ dents in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey put their trust in Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already following new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful success@@ ors , the perpetr@@ ators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the potential damage potential depends on the type of data much higher than before .
the perpetr@@ ators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things in future .
at the Def@@ con chi@@ pper conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the release of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work closely at any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cockpit top falls down there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ featured and 10@@ 26 l with revers@@ ed back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema seat and thus offer storage space , which is up to 1.@@ 24 m from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to make his work somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another power@@ train : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for security systems , the City emergency brake assist ( operates at speeds 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because while maneu@@ vering many obstacles are rated as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed control re@@ acts to the traffic sign recognition and un@@ locks the speed if necessary .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation system , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI bus@@ hing are located under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline not liable : crash on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Du@@ essel@@ dorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is possible only for dangers that are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken down a knee in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened all over the world - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline didn &apos;t have to pay any damages to the man .
illness : when does the organizer get paid ?
after their journey , sick vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the disease is without doubt in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms .
in the case of a negotiated case , a family on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ il was severely affected by diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their disease brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective wastewater treatment plant , allegedly poll@@ uted by sea@@ water .
the family felt that the trip was insufficient - and compla@@ ined against the organizer .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success in court .
in fact , the treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned shortly before departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duties of information , so the judgment .
since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be so@@ ber and determined at the same time to react to terrorist threats .
it is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division .
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if offen@@ ders have to leave the country more quickly , this will increase the security and strength also the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a realization of the proposals up to the Bundestag election 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ four @-@ digit scale over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be punished again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the arm@@ or law will be amended to make it more difficult to purchase weapons on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much deb@@ ated sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions , such as the danger of the citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to psychological ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act a ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against ac@@ tion@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a sla@@ p for the char@@ gers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka prohibition and the abolition of the double nationality before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a general prohibition of full @-@ wear is problematic for constitutional law .
you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything that you refuse , and I refuse to wear the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green boss Simone Peter designed the minister to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terrorist p@@ act and action ability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ verb@@ s and a tightening of the right of residence bring people in this country no longer safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway junction
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here is a picture of November .
but that is to change : the legal remedy is to be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the ambient street every evening when they drive over the highway at Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction will be extended in the area between the Hammer Road and exit Wes@@ eler Straße the right @-@ hand gauge lane by 700 meters .
then drive directly from the hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is split up early , thereby improving the overall process on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder is driving the drivers above all between 17 and 7 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the return sta@@ u reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ en route and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic is driven only one lane through the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back in a good three @-@ quarter period .
the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the load @-@ bearing capacity to absorb heavy duty traffic in two lanes .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated workshops will last , the competent state operation cannot say .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official rest period up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal remedy the country deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because of handi@@ caps .
the traffic is passed on to the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural trip : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater plan now a music project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enables young people with a migration background and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the production in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with an immigration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome groups the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most young people in the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it would have been possible for them to follow the course of action , such as the press release of the Young Theatre of Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ gue , and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background between 14 and 20 years will be given the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
there are profiles of leading retailers , with analysis of their performance and the challenges they face .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
in view of the increasing number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement
the weather has made the star @-@ sni@@ fter Gu@@ ck@@ ern a stroke through the bill in the southwest of Germany - but there is still hope .
the night had been bad for clouds and rain to watch the spectacle of heaven , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the star sheds are per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us that goes up north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep before the wake @-@ up ring .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how can sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter Weber , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ ep and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one understands temporarily , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an inhal@@ ation and through @-@ sleep distur@@ b@@ ance .
just the pass @-@ through experience many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board in the German Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication .
not in@@ frequently the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is particularly common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ ep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors are mutually dependent .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly begins to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worries , gives an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I get to the doctor with sleeping disorders ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor .
the impair@@ ment may look quite different : one is down@@ cast , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache .
in order to relieve the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or drugs - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
in Germany there are hardly practi@@ sed sleep medi@@ cs , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleeping problems , one should first contact the family doctor , advises wo@@ olen .
this can be clari@@ fied with studies if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what &apos;s going on ?
for example , for an examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors recommend snor@@ ing with breathing drop@@ outs , in case of sick day@@ time fatigue , sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ etze explains .
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
one should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just make no lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after gradu@@ ating , one goes to bed at his normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose leather , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler at the finger .
in addition , a camera is attached to the sleeping alco@@ ve on the ceiling .
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can place a better sleep .
she does count on : regular sleep and down@@ time , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , refrain from watching alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is completely not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler faces Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he first brought gold at the short@@ wave world championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has himself protected against his ex @-@ team@@ mates in front of his critics .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20.000 € bonus and a jungle king 15@@ 0.000 € should not be surprised by missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night .
the convey@@ ance system in swimming @-@ sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls , on the other hand , are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely at dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler should have already announced nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is the way you should also keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot control a certain time before WM / OS of independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the choice @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage Acc@@ ep@@ ted
professional thi@@ eves at the airport in Düsseldorf
on Thursday , civilians of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the suspi@@ ci@@ ons had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and bags of baggage as ban@@ dits .
at 21.@@ 30 hrs , civil servants in the Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang known to the police officers from past theft off@@ ences .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July and were in a collaborative , collaborative and especially professional manner .
the specialists of the Cri@@ min@@ ate Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ate 34 were able to prove four acts specifically for crimes committed in Germany for crimes committed in Germany .
in the process , they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichs@@ hain works at first sight , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which should also be demol@@ ished soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 .
in recent weeks , article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichs@@ hain is called , will be fav@@ oured by burning cars in the last few weeks .
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have le@@ ases , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially Berlin &apos;s internal sen@@ ator H@@ enkel spoke several times in favour of a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as a point of departure for autonomous violence .
after having been evacu@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rolled three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the ground , shut down parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers on behalf of the unknown home owners took the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the evacu@@ ation had been illegal , and a day later police and builders refused under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the street seems peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late @-@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who runs three children here , is gener@@ ously anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the residents of the building projects they share the care of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which wants to bring about several police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory lef@@ ti@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin internal sen@@ ator and the police open between the occup@@ iers and their neighbors , obviously does not exist .
in the east of Berlin , Friedrichs@@ hain was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which today has a low average in comparison with the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR , among them almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße close to the R@@ ī@@ ga .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under large police deplo@@ y@@ ments in a regular street fight , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ ing liners from around the world : with them residents from GDR times and former house @-@ occup@@ ants are now sharing their neighborhood .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on raised discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown with color @-@ bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year so often along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as bodily injury are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the biggest part of the criminal off@@ ences make material damage , which tend to meet the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is compla@@ ining : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they have certainly not been .
even the famous burning cars will no longer exist in Riga .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the R@@ ī@@ ga Street - and remained .
that is why it was also so important that the local residents recovered their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through face @-@ less new@@ buildings in former construction gaps that disp@@ lace the old occup@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , these are con@@ dos , which are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well drunk here live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if someone never stops ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for drau@@ ghts who are fond of paint bombs : the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kie@@ z .
who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who goes into a pub district , can complain about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the uns@@ ett@@ ling wool mil@@ ch@@ cock , which has above all a problem .
for example , some - less sne@@ ak@@ y than rather targeting the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to leave the place .
looking for an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an uns@@ ett@@ ling wool mil@@ k@@ sau .
but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as networking activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent job for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer that Anni@@ ka supports Deu@@ sch@@ le honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers soon stand in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they need to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired residential areas .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the county council office to the municipality and the Job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search turned out to be very difficult for some time .
in fact , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it does not function , while relying on private dwell@@ ings , Deu@@ sch@@ le .
for this reason , communities need to be aci@@ di@@ fied as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be gri@@ pped or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do charitable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy how Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sports , contacts with local people and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here , too , administration and honorary members jump here .
it is central that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever will develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never be integrated .
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says customer honestly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People , with whom nothing works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and his customers is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s all a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : did the two after recent events fear ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensitive .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins killed them completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary members must look for activities locally and in the region .
they have always been in the background that soon a new push could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics shy away .
actually , it is unfair to put them on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach is already busy integrating the previous human beings in a reasonable way .
currently , these are about 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
