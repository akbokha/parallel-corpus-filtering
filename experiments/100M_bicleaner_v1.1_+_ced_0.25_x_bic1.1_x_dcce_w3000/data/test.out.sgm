<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer sought a little change with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>

<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer ever - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He left with his family about the system of the ALRV, on a horse he swung not even for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">German sports aid handed over to the man from Andorf as part of a small gala the Golden Sport Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already adored him.</seg>

<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US presidential candidates are undivided in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue." ""</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively restrain regulation, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich would increase, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "in the meantime, Trump and Clinton are almost worrying." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the Republicans nationally.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be party-internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, to announce the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand renewable energies with its investment programme and demands: "a country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but just to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "they should also be better paid, say Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of US $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rushed, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens, is facing growth." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance physicians have called for their union to approve new labour competition measures in their dispute with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more labor campaigns starting in early September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JAC said that ministers had refused to respond to the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assistance physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members, who voted for the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members, who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JAC Ellen McCourt said that the government "persistently quiet" would have had problems, which led to the rejection of the contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I can't deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be narrower and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke repeatedly by his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper complained that Erdogan had behaved as if there was never anything worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable coolness demonstrated that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was angry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin distributed and accused Ankara of having rebelled against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the veto will be difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state controlled media conducted a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious were the accusations from senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria's territories controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan, first and foremost, needs all the friends he can get after he was dismissed from his office last month on a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - notably the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television predicted cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted taking over power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the persistent grudge about the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this brilliant palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one as an analyst once described to me, "Alliance of outsiders": two countries that violate the West and feel badly treated and now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be indicative that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they would not even have stripped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally promised to answer a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey threw the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">For many years, IVANOV was part of the tightest confidence of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement by the Kremlin it reads that without giving reasons Putin ordered Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a substitute for Ivanovs since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it means (in Russian) that later he was the director and Chief of Staff of the governing personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state in respect of bills of law and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will withdraw at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced there - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim that a man who once was touted as a potential president, once again wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, which are cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov says it is true that I have asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entrust me for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV received the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was the chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as a third term Putin had violated the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers connected the north deck of Queensland crossings to the Viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closing of the" "" "ceiling boblower" "", "which approach the completion by each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incline ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the entire deck decks are in place and the last section of Decks gets a concrete casting for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the landing page.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive as the Viaduct is 222 meters long, about 6,000 tons weighs and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Heightened, because the tolerances on which the team were working was tiny - on each side they were only rusting a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="6">First of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "s & D Group president Christoph Bratmann writes:" "" "we agree with the Greens: if you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments will have to be considered as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness which pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time playing on screens has been lamented by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created.</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once they were found," "" "photographed" "" "(over a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" "" "captured" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the U.S., the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person returns every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that pursues 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of launching the game, the number of follow-up people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for the increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns for health that people want" "" "to take 30 minutes" "" "to" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active every day" "", "because many public messages are boring and coming from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that is fun for them.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also grumbling games that have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk around a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What shall it do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has occurred a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will diminish with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to the success of Pokemons, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all of this.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now also Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast raked on Thursday for a multi-battle title and enlarged the gap between herself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team-team Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women of Simone Biles contend on the floating beam during the individual multi-competition of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-battle title and overall the fifth while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success represents them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael Phelps who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years her sport, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - won with such amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou rescuon from her said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so very much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American female Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-competition of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell party of the retired crew coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although it insisted on having planned for a long way to the top, never having planned the future, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music, which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans during a school excursion into the gymnasium where Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost any more competition, a winning streak that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina was easily led by two rotations the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish beams and floor plans - in which Biles holds the world championship title.</seg>
<seg id="28">She got up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and with a 15,933 on the floor another one.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman gently embraced her when she expected her final appearance - pure formality - and tears poured on Biles bright red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collective book.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old man of the team, called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her downfall she threw down the audience of Kussheba, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Bilal is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-old has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year old girl were shot, who had died in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix, while they stopped in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a drive, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a firearm while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police said that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery of robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they are associated with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed in Hispanic homes within four months and two more were injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," told Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that the suspects used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report about the shooting which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfalls and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday. it is expected to have more rainfalls all Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large-scale floods after extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to help the communities affected.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags have increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that the community of Tangipahua had requested ten thousand sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used across large parts in southern Louisiana to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service allowed an additional 3 to 5 inch rain to fall in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama a flood warning system was used on Friday as it continued to rain in the mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that an upstream flood in Ascension Parish represents a danger, as these rivers are only slowly flowing into Lake Maurepas over the well-worn rivers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest state on Friday at 09.00, which was ever recorded.</seg>

<seg id="21">Hansford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they stayed until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Krautmann said the flooding" "" "spread" "" "quickly, as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities consider evacuation instructions." ""</seg>

<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the soil has been considerably sucked by rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rains and flooding caused the rescuing of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahua Parish and lessons in five school districts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine taking part in the Women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all I've been with each summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three Turnerines, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholicin, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among the female female dancers was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, but masterly gyms.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-competition event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the peak of this sport, but we don't see gymnastics classes all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily associated with private gymnastics held by parents responsible for training, orientation, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are in affluent suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to offer the municipalities aun innumerable, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy accessible gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my Turnkey for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, which brings thousands of young girls to care for the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of Girl Power through the holding of the Olympic team golds and thanks for starting so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anticoagulant medication Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="7">Approximately 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form plaque.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the layer breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clot loosens, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more probable.</seg>

<seg id="7">Beat him then with his knee to the bar and twist, while the aggressor is bent before pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the gun on him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright shouts his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe for a guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller subtracted his immune system and strangeness to a serious test, by putting some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The host and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shook off his course on a euro note, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a purging button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the removal of each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is getting involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of leaking the sink of a toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he licked out, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money stations to stations to dishwashing buttons of toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he did justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial score showed a luminometric score of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometer number of newly washed hands amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick after their luminometres had more than 4000 units, while fresh washed hands were less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "This comes close to the worst I have gerocked in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not dock here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we wanted to offer the consumer something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we carried out crazy Brainstormings, which ended that we said" "" "Let's call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others, in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after a deletion of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and their partner Shaun Treportcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found ownership in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls lined up holes, wooden floorboards were torn, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is believed to be regarded as not as beautiful as Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screams, strikers and curses.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease agreement, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house that may be torn down under certain circumstances, old trash was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, wooden floorboards were piled up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing led her and her partner by force this week by force from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would sow the family to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were summoned at regular intervals, for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown site of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family, as a delogization is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have boldly approached us and have provided us with the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the deletion on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the administration will now have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, police launched a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as balances, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon obtained a fine, after having found himself guilty of owning a drug of class B in merchant custody.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were graffiti with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say they will navigate renters who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow by the police of Devon and Cornwall said that the delogization is a clear warning to the other tenant who do not adhere to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "this goes to those who think they can behave without reproaches and to those who were harmed by such behaviour," "" "she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers in the country are on the road to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so do not select the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays there are helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, spread flyers and count on the end of the voices, only to apply painstakingly.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and final holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign briefly on the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>

<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalitionality.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old, and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one can see from his big posters.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they have made everything quite jagged," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station." ""</seg>

<seg id="8">The work in charge of the construction work is also commended, for example when it comes to furnishing houses.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the asphalt road in Ofandingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg exists again, the traffic situation within the village was relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from Ofandingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>

<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many crews were looking for and more familiar with their Navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were franchising in residential areas.</seg>

<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the road is open again for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales quarries, each one asks is scrutinized.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>

<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the local restaurants along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him but all the restaurants" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>

<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I have to let half of his staff have been dismissed." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, otherwise benefiting from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now she must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where something has been handled so much more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">At all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are now seeing less frequently due to the complicated traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't get here, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">But Göhner has no doubt that after the end of the restoration work his family-clientele has come back.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on its clientele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the commentary arrow to sow it under the pseudonym of non-allele men's middle age with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed revival of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horde by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older Plattenkopurchasers retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit before I stand, hold my hands and say something intimate like: "so let's have a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho slowly collapses in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent salesmen were resident - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to judge their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I run by Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (number of data: eight men middle aged, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and once again buy objects he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records tend to be introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets on YouGov's profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pump, people who heard about the comeback and have decided to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have conducted, people usually get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica, to realize that record stores offer a comforting community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers were offended by the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retire to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, objects that evoke happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to get involved mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like her social workers!" "" "a staff of a record stack flaps out." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't own record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned, while browsing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came just recently and said," "" "I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musically.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, which only slowly come to life.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a more colorful audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - game of guest's newest synthetic and sextant pop, instead of experimental jazz, wears out of the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks odd but naïve psychotic traumas are hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more like a shopping window than buying a big shopping cart.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives off with a loving sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record labels: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I pretending to be wearing jeans pants, I watched a group of young teenage girls who group up for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "record art." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research yielded that the results of YouGov agree, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with strolling through the record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates while they steer clear of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who worries about middle-aged men over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to submit 72 temporary businesses where individuals within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would be a fire and sanitation risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also explained that temporary shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais" "" "are absolutely understandable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who" "" "live in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the breaks was the Jungle Book Kids'Café of the camp, which is operated profitably and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that" "" "the closure" "" "would be a catastrophe for these children, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two help organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number to date - after a steep increase of newcomers during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-year rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the deodoro stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji issued a master class in handling, side-stepping, back, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medals of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was defeated by the not too bad consolation of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it's unlikely that at least a Brite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This flap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and allowed GBs to bounce out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one were running in driving buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau smashed in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With only four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he changed.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A tweaking Tackle of Mitchell halted the mount of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but Fiji has only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Veremalua placed a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the game of reincarnation and there was still more than a minute of playing... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou stressed by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB brought fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua went through Tuisova after a brilliant interplay from Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an experiment for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South seeinate, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame made the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the fijis embraced, and GB nodded devastating in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the past, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals of 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a scarce semi-final match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton crossed the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling from Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-side team, secured the win - and therefore the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinial gold than these games and that will be what will be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 tough pieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was all present when they rowed to the second Olympic champion in the two without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports, who laid such a benchmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all their 39.ter unprotected use, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlets that glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and no one was as an aid as the coach who did not know about 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risked.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treating early 2014, out of season, which kept the break down to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was hospitalized and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "the work of the" "" "Veitenstein group" "" "is" "" "Bavarian-wide as exemplary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this stands Rupert Göller, who was a member of the Zweckverband workforce for 31 years, 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water-purpose association of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, transports approximately 150,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchberg, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply agreements for other cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, Breitbrunns mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Geller was appointed Wasserwart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational skills, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the elevated tanks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial refurbishment of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and you have always added new things because water is life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudatio she praised Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he has lived up to the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group to the nitrate reduction before the water forum of Lower Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller on his part praised Wasserwart Alfons Griebel who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best waterman and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a highlight from his point of view he described the well construction and restructuration of the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the biggest challenge and the hardest use were the piping in the high tank near Kirchberg on a 3rd of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">The supply of Neubrunn can be maintained only once, because it was filled with hoses from Pettstadt.</seg>

<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it remains at the release from the Renewable Energies Convergence to the so-called" "" "self-stream production" "" "in the German steel industry," "" "said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" "" "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" "" "(WAZ, Friday edition)."

<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission following talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levelling of 20 percent is assumed.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even these are not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for self-producing electricity.</seg>

<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to exacerbate when the world's largest producer of China was forcing mortal steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are throwing price dumping on Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased a little.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties show impact on import steel, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have brightened up.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp wanted last but not to exclude closings of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel producers will remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>

<seg id="30">After a brief upliftment in May, the produced crowd went back to the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in the Lehramt degree she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old is singing in a senior ensemble.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she is doing something good for her health and her spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singen is a great hobby for seniors right from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures are dissolved, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is because senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who demand his lungs regularly will not get out of the puddle in everyday life even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "older people often have a very special effect," "" "says Ursula Lenz von der Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisations." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher value, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through song texts and especially melodies, people themselves deny themselves to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head is also required to perform a particular performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate on one's own voice and to a given rhythm while adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone practice not only concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, Hackler thinks.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I practise for something for a long time, I will get better and wake up beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing are therefore enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate, even if he thinks you have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes next?</seg>
<seg id="29">If you are looking for a suitable offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, you can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you don't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help in the internet search.</seg>
<seg id="35">Whoever wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="9">On Friday morning two explosives went up again, and another man was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket, a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>

<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks that is typical for the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising or with international terrorism.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf the waste water fee will increase again at the latest, if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a rough calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then lie at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, it was determined by the Kulmbach Office of the Housing Administration that there is shelter for these sewage installations.</seg>

<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, citizens as well as industrial and industrial companies from Welding, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the wallets.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases lie between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>

<seg id="10">In all three wastewater facilities, Schmidt founded the company's grave breaches in order to handle relatively small facilities with a very low waste water waste, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the previous calculation period in all three systems, renovation and repair costs have fallen to a considerable extent, not least due to their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welding, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as an Asian caricature criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are immaculate, revolving tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past in which they were accused that the App Blackface would promote or propagate white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested some users a filter that gave them slit eyes, wrong teeth and evaporated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others declined the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos became widespread, that the filter was "vulnerable and said to be uncomfortable."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the deflected extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in our hands.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents - might tend to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "when one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user," "" "so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was earlier," "" "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and a telephone interview, she said that she believes that rapid controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the Snapchat control practices.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinesich-american Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat mostly left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a human resource responsible focusing on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military command falsifies ISIS secret service information, establishes committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which allowed the actual conditions on site to be reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Defence Forces, secret services committees and the military budget report, reports of great discontent under Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence agencies typically pictured by high-ranking CentCom commanders marked a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions were allowed on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "noted Ken Calvert, a republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the CentCom are reaching to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government tips have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superior, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts," "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin already in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigations, it is so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to bring down the threat of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The republicans called the Task Force into life after being admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed with more detailed insights while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">The democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the republican task force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom has created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," stated the highest-ranking Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "shamed the morals under analysts and" "" "gave too little room for divergent opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of having found evidence of a White House intervention in the CentCom analyst regarding a" "" "certain political view" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday through The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector, who were contacted by CentCom analyst complaints.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these key issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have further effects on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">The accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of the dependencies of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush foresaw only a small occupation force in Iraq and refused to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker states that contrary to the statements by the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State could have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This knowledge, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom's damal commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his overly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro events feel constantly and unavoidable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, which is handed down from the Crossbow to the swimmer to the turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the waiting queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Leopoly or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been built under these well-known names, which would be sent to Prime Time, by sponsors and feel-good TV ads, if he was a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports which are not generally recognized: air pistollen, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may have a long rule.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should show arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the jumping on the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparse noticed the last 16 years that many of them, I asked, did not know that it is an Olympic portal at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes for competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and has had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who are responsible for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has a certain outsider, partly because it is suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschule as the sound for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending collision - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed by performance, degree of difficulty and" "" "flight time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists in their quest for gold have to go farther, faster, upward and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also a further highlight in the television broadcast: those of the world or the Olympic Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I consider to be a bit tiresome when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympic Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the Angus and the objectivity of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley awaits his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia clashed with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during collisions with police at gunners.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia struggling to break with it?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shaken the country and spread in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's answer was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Circulating videos about the protests that are probably the last or the beginning of this year show how security people strike young people with sticks while forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now asking for a thorough investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression through the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, and dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or detention, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you oppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a provisionally criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, can benefit from turbulence and be re-armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of falling under the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate through the social media, as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government obstructs access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies hiding where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave up that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who predominantly come from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flat land areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to co-ordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromos areas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 per cent of the population, which are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "the third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia witnessed such upheaval in 2005 after thousands of elections protested that the government was apparently fuelled by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids many protesters have been killed even if it was less than in the last months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters attacked in Gondar, an ambitan city, led by Tigray and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over the neighboring Somalia, although it recently concluded that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse into an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign, fearing that his multiple repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would be the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification gave rise to new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly to the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his comrades who make an effort to protect him during an eventful phase in order to explain to the peculiar position he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump returned in terms of allegation on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that he had created ISIS, the President and Mrs. Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation perfectly serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing of it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism rattles Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump again tried to reverse this issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestion would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump was already in defence of sarcasm.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July, he criticised himself when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course, I said that sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," clear "according to what the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert observing the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump assumed an even more corrosive tone, as his survey values went further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a great lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-at-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries to apologise for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he emphasises the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how provocative his statements may also be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent advocates, was struggling to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr. Giuliani said, so he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trumps about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backtellers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans attempt to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread herself aggressively under control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being roaming at each of his words and being taken against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "TV experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You cannot!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trumps's apology as just a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the President Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicatessen on Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on this day was slightly more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "" "said Jane Ziegelman." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "her husband Andrew Coe added," "" "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes's last book "Chop Suey" was the Chinese kitchen in the USA, while Ziegelman told in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "An decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, fast food in the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered hackers, this found the couple suitable for discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "rich food was very popular," "" "said Ziegelman." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper, which stretched the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating as many peanuts that they serve as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE smiled.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat-Buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pâté for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "a Square Meal" marks the way in which the country went to no longer be the land of land.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when food for Americans was a central, tense theme," "" "explains Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new diet was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserole as a "wonderful way to recycle food residue," Ziegelman noticed, as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the focal point of American cuisine for years, became a rarely serrated luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Odd mixtures were tried, as a low-calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="27">During their research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>

<seg id="32">Like never before or since, budget economists - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943, drove the country's eating habits like this.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housekeeping women" and the challenge of becoming fair as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "a Square Meal" "" "is a feast of historical delicacies." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Especially tasty are the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-me-cakes-food-attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While publicly praised the simple Iowa farmer's kitchen of his kitchen, he spoke as the million-millionaire man of the world to whom he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was delightfully realism alien.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, would have asked him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the hypocrisy of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt made that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with food, was rejected as soon as the country came back on its legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food, "Ziegelman said," as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">In writing the book, the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Brickman's mother-in-law - for example how they could not throw food away.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "she had a real fear of the waste of food," "" "Coe said." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland has only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland-shark is floating along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1,220 metres wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a satte 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this lifestyle embossed by slowness seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" at any rate by a Greenland hai who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "says Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Admittedly, the evolutionist thought for a long time that Greenland will become stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are hard to observe, after all they live mainly in the Eismeer in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures of the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-pentines measured them, when they withheld six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, these sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt asleep animals or patrol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadaver, which torches from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lentists of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempt to spill larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal, with 220 centimeters in length, the lentists, on the other hand, contained a low excess of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons tests, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their liner core, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493 cm long Grönlandhai showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers could assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland haie with the multiplication obviously can be at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methus-emes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland wal, in which bacon on the neck had a 120 year old harpoon tip, was captured in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame of asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they later mature - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible," "" "explains Scheuerlein evolutionist." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewish director beats Berlin hotel because Israeli preselection was removed after "Arab" invitation - RT News</seg>
<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media clock after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli preselection since it had requested Arab guests according to an employee. "</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," issued his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="5">The country, however, was not listed between countries that can be invoked directly from the hotel room.</seg>

<seg id="2">With the lifting of the sanctions, according to Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trading rate between Moscow and Teheran increased by 70.9 percent in the year-on-year comparison.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions against Iran have been abolished, the interest of Russian companies in the country grew strongly, the ambassador said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral unit Efin Valley-Haigerloch, St. Anna, travelled to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were met together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next Romsine ride of all the mini-registrants in the period of two years, the senior ministerial circular St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided for the Episcopal city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and his children, rose up in the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Fr. Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration at St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrimage and shared the Pilgrim's blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster Unserer loved woman stood and so the Pilgrimage was resigned from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were surrounded by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts in the morning and evening.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the minis on field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly made Rast to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the nights, the parishes of the local parishes were at their disposal.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided for a tasty and strenuous dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we continued on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day was the stage after St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at first heated heat had to be descended some 500 metres in altitude and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward in the evening was a common BBQ on the badge.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrim's day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, we went to the final leg to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy the minis arrived at the Freiburg Minster in the late afternoon and went through the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert was welcomed at the evening Mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in a men's team Sprint at the velodrome in Rio to fame when the British team was defending the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. the Jumping and made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory of New Zealand's favorites.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they catch only a modest sixth place in London in March at the London Underground World Championships in London.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a sign.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired had a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - who were four years ago with Hoy defeated - and Skinner put in the qualification round a Olympiarekord, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders prevailed in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was scarce after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that was going on in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic chord in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 Triumph at the site Kenny and Hoys, Hinder said that after a weak start he intentionally descended to the train.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection to England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said:" "" "it feels like the Great Britain flags on the grandstand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have been working as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We came so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on 23 March (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hinder said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be struck to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will be focusing on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had been arguing yesterday with officials prior to the qualification, when functionaries were calling him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue tomorrow and end, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong web-based team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a troop of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary illustration of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Drama was played in the background, such as the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April amid sexism and murder charges and retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, when one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the Portland aluminium melt in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract and thus will lift all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, not giving any further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy, which is scheduled for 20 years, will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2,000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects since the smelting process consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa completed the Point Henry melt, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting plant of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects the plant to continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt", "said the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL also said that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions," which will be effective as of November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "from this point, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the income in the financial year 17," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the revenue to AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $187 million in the "expectation of cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to expel the contracts, to operate the" "" "Alcoas" "" "ability to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt" "" "is not impaired." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would have come into force this year, even if it is still a declaration of why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Due to the poor economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland melt plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements by the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland annually consumes around 600 megawatts and tomato about 900 MW of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market].</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to weeping," "" "Kendall wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), shared reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular Showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest): they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the cliché-haired plot of almost every birthday episode of a child show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to leave her other girls somehow in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, certainly a new era of cardashian has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim likes her beating the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the journal is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles more of an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the newspaper 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover star is eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still seep before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, there were clearly more "celebrities who like fashion" as "models that are celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-laureate and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence in 2013 was on the cover, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenny's success does not like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV history, Jenners has always been a bit tense in the world of fashion.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised them and called them "the Mistings of the Moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings sounded high again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying around on the mise seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertisement for your primer of Estée Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her own pictures of Cindy Crawfords's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her spare time she is to be seen in Reality TV. presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite clumsy.</seg>

<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies who earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software producers, there are attempts to circumvent ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block scoring on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the coding on his advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of what part of the page is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her fight between the open source community and the converters has been in progress since the invention of signatories," and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered into the fight is a strong indication of how worrying advertisements for the industry have become.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a study published last year by Pagefair and Adobe, we use approximately 200 million people display lockers; almost four times as much in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue Facebooks.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police call on witnesses after a woman was driving on a highway in the early hours of the morning with a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a motorway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman laid down in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was transferred from several vehicles, including a lorry, wanted to kill himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She still died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police who asked these as well as any witnesses of the incident to report.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "an investigation procedure was opened, which is a" "" "logical" "" "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a clash avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "this is something the public prosecutor has to decide," "" "said Hofstetter." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers must not assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year, a police officer was acquitted of the negligent killing after having transferred and killed a man who lay in August 2014 on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and had become unconscious in the street, took the judgment.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court noted that the policewoman -- responding to an emergency call -- rode on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely unusual and unpredictable situation," the judge said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably once inhabitable according to projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have met similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and yet turned on slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably indicated more dry areas than earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus benefited also from a sun, which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotational speed of Venus is exposed for almost two months," "" "stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that had previously been suspected of planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen declined, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympics 2016: chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, Weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland cannot start from Poland in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping incidents.</seg>
<seg id="4">A well-caught athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping incidents have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre barrier runner in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the critically acclaimed athletics competitions these messages come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Military Tribunal CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old finished fourth in the finals over 100 m of butterflies, only about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the events of over 50 m of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the IOC has applied for the opening of the B sample and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter very seriously and demands full co-operation with the investigations," "" "said Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history the IOC, but the CAS, is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news spread about the positive test at Danekova, the 33-year-old went to the offensive herself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV channel BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "it is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be nutritional supplements," "" "explained the athletes." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance should be the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B test should also be positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissov promptly spoke with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why sportsmen do not pull the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "We are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doubling nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "on Friday, the case" "" "Adrian Zielinski" "", "the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, was tested positive for three days earlier on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletes, the Danekova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world association banned the entire Russian team up to one exception because of systematic doping, including the Läufernation Kenya producing numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming sport, the previous offences in China had also caused fierce disputes between athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium over 200 m of freestyle, I want to commit myself," "" "said Lacourt in the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun also stood at the centre of a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping fraud," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was positive for the Chinese nationals in 2014 on the stimulant of the Trimetazide, but only a three-month lock had to be removed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data lau: so perfide hermits hacker their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmailing software currently target companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by malware-defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, partly victim of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a Ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software, according to the observations of Malwarebytes, on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially injected ransom is significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of malware," "" "explains Malwarebyte chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malware programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was scary in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the victim's computer, it seeks to search for unused files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end turn code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of coin currency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users have the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of affected German companies reported turnover losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent had even had to break down business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "don't pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In an up-to-date study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackmail users and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their casualties via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, address freely accessible support sites, or decipher free sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively low-risk profits from Ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski of the SOPHOS antivirus provider: "a single person can write a ransomware within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malicious software then in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kits have been created so that malware itself, advice and additional tools have been purchased for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the delivery includes an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for other hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums on the background, buys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is carried out on an infected machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with spreading," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that better safeguard their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of respondents in the Malwarebytes survey put their trust in Ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already following new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful successors, the perpetrators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," "" "explains Malwarebyte chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the potential damage potential depends on the type of data much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things in future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Defcon chipper conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it does not work closely at any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant, only the cockpit top falls down there.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "there is not only a trunk of 453 l at high-featured and 1026 l with reversed back rests, but there is the" "" "Magic Seats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical when it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema seat and thus offer storage space, which is up to 1.24 m from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to make his work somewhat quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another powertrain: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment in the tested top variant" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">For security systems, the City emergency brake assist (operates at speeds 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning sometimes irritates because while maneuvering many obstacles are rated as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed control reacts to the traffic sign recognition and unlocks the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation system, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI bushing are located under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow at the motorway junction</seg>
<seg id="2">It stalls regularly on the bypass road - here is a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But that is to change: the legal remedy is to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is a good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the ambient street every evening when they drive over the highway at Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">On the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August), road construction will be extended in the area between the Hammer Road and exit Weseler Straße the right-hand gauge lane by 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then drive directly from the hammer road to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: the traffic is split up early, thereby improving the overall process on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road narrowing on the feeder is driving the drivers above all between 17 and 7 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the return stau reaches the bridge over the Albersloen route and sometimes also beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason is the needle-eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Weseler Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, traffic is driven only one lane through the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be built back in a good three-quarter period.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason: static calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the load-bearing capacity to absorb heavy duty traffic in two lanes.</seg>
<seg id="15">As long as this bottleneck and the associated workshops will last, the competent state operation cannot say.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, it has to be reckoned with years: because the bridge has an official rest period up to 2034.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep before the wake-up ring.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weber, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands temporarily, however, is the Insomnia, i.e. an inhalation and through-sleep disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just the pass-through experience many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board in the German Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently the sleep disturbance is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is particularly common in depression," "" "says Weep." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are mutually dependent.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly begins to ponder about everyday problems and worries, gives an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I get to the doctor with sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: one is downcast, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to relieve the sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or drugs - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany there are hardly practised sleep medics, Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleeping problems, one should first contact the family doctor, advises woolen.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with studies if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what's going on?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, for an examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors recommend snoring with breathing dropouts, in case of sick daytime fatigue, sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just make no lunch," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After graduating, one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose leather, a chest strap and a feeler at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera is attached to the sleeping alcove on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can place a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">She does count on: regular sleep and downtime, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, refrain from watching alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is completely not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="3">On Thursday, civilians of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspicions had committed several handkerchiefs and bags of baggage as bandits.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30 hrs, civil servants in the Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang known to the police officers from past theft offences.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July and were in a collaborative, collaborative and especially professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the Criminate Commissariate 34 were able to prove four acts specifically for crimes committed in Germany for crimes committed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the process, they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some linden trees, in between still another cobblestone pavement: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain works at first sight, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the facade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which should also be demolished soon, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">In recent weeks, article about this "trendy district," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain is called, will be favoured by burning cars in the last few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have leases, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially Berlin's internal senator Henkel spoke several times in favour of a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "no-go zone" for policemen and 94 as a point of departure for autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After having been evacuated on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police patrolled three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the ground, shut down parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers on behalf of the unknown home owners took the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the evacuation had been illegal, and a day later police and builders refused under the cheering of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late-i.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who runs three children here, is generously annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the building projects they share the care of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "it doesn't sound like a" "" "Kiez" "", "which wants to bring about several police protection against vandaliatory leftists." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin internal senator and the police open between the occupiers and their neighbors, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the east of Berlin, Friedrichshain was actually a traditional working-class district, which today has a low average in comparison with the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR, among them almost the entire Mainzer Straße close to the Rīga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under large police deployments in a regular street fight, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and polling liners from around the world: with them residents from GDR times and former house-occupants are now sharing their neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on raised discs or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with color-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year so often along with the words" "" "left-wing violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as bodily injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest part of the criminal offences make material damage, which tend to meet the newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is complaining: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they have certainly not been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars will no longer exist in Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rīga Street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was also so important that the local residents recovered their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through face-less newbuildings in former construction gaps that displace the old occupants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "finally, these are condos, which are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well drunk here live," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I absolutely cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if someone never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for draughts who are fond of paint bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws, should be aware of it - just like someone who goes into a pub district, can complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons introduced only with first names have asked not to be called by their correct name</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine's customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the unsettling wool milchcock, which has above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, some - less sneaky than rather targeting the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to leave the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an unsettling wool milksau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as networking activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent job for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine's customer that Annika supports Deuschle honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers soon stand in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They need to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the county council office to the municipality and the Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search turned out to be very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not function, while relying on private dwellings, Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">For this reason, communities need to be acidified as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be gripped or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy how Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sports, contacts with local people and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here, too, administration and honorary members jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make time wisely, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever will develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach can't work and be useless, he will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are problems," "" "says customer honestly," "" "People, with whom nothing works." "" "the work of Deuschle and his customers is always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "that's all a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two after recent events fear radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine's customer clearly," "" "which some may call naive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins killed them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary members must look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that soon a new push could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics shy away.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbach is already busy integrating the previous human beings in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">Currently, these are about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
