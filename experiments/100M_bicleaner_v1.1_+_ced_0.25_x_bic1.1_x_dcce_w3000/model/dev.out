Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teher@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it should also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for many years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement building and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal of the two further deterior@@ ated by the deal promoted by Obama to the Iranian nuclear programme .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can before the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had been rejected with reference to the election im@@ pending in Israel .
in a not@@ ebook , Professor tries to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which was on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff members heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with which he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not represent him a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he believed that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he did a doctorate in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was the women &apos;s flock at that time .
all the girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ it in Gau@@ tier .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were both on a summer @-@ fair three years ago .
later they played one or the other gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night September 5th for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Fr . Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ mid@@ t &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wache , while the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sang . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season staff as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it is planning to employ 40,000 people in stores and sales centres throughout the country . 4@@ 5.000 workers were employed at Christmas time in 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with job interviews and the number of employees from October to December is increasing .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shops with employees that sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an im@@ pending documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated G@@ äh@@ nen and an arm &apos;s length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ str@@ it@@ tig the biggest journey film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss reiter@@ ates all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in the face of the crisis in Syria , which they have shown in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand it as flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks at p@@ olls below , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them only won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mps staying power and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of ten re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa said last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters were happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would &quot; enth@@ use &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next one in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would become the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see Tru@@ mps Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first electoral state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six of ten independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they expose their scholars , republi@@ can voters keep tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July set their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at that point in the last cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet it is clear that a variety of GO@@ P voters see Tru@@ mps campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp strikes almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp &apos;s leadership , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is spread over more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp will re@@ ap the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters supporting Tru@@ mp say they have for@@ given their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is the strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
six of ten re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rapi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse was in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will hold decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of ten re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new levels .
in the meantime , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ sider status .
six of ten re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider to be someone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines stops / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; poll@@ uted . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt und Co . : the five most exclusive resi@@ dences in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ok@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , one square meter of a roof building costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter is most cost .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bus in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential neighbor@@ hoods , however , one of the prices is available as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro - per square meter , well noticed .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Go@@ ze
double Tor@@ po@@ ke in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es matches ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth stage success in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received good assistance from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto at his 28th place in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shining .
Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the Royal Class , among them against well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European teams with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went bol@@ dly with their offensive efforts , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous to work .
the attacks were often initiated by a game shift on the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which was rarely interrupted by O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i , the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion passed the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ es of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct @-@ on , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto had par@@ ked with his knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant play , Pi@@ raeus was able to set con@@ i@@ fers .
but on Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was forgiveness .
for example , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye over the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) .
prior to Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola left a quad@@ ru@@ ple with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cabin , was initially sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said athletes Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later .
in front of the game , it was in the stadium to Kra@@ v@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bavaria fans in their audience block evi@@ dently had prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ raeus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
good news : in case of absence , the risk drops rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is derived from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ che .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphas@@ ises DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it could , however , take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing again reaches the level of non @-@ smokers , explains Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people need to convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Study Manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health up to high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years is affected by lack of tooth , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking lowers the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
archae@@ ologists stum@@ ble on the remains of the L@@ ate Anti@@ quity to Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer
for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings have excav@@ ated , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction works on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments .
for all construction projects in the district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a department of archaeological soil conservation .
in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found a fifth .
from text documents it was already known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with some 350 graves was discovered , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman captured by freight train
after a young woman is unhappy at the station at the station in Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the federal police asks the population for assistance .
on the early wed@@ n@@ esday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
due to the acquisition of the train , it has carried he@@ avi@@ est injuries to it according to the Federal Police .
it was treated in emergency medical conditions and transported to a hospital by ambul@@ ance personnel .
on the basis of the noc@@ turn@@ al crossing of the young woman there are no findings to the intermedi@@ ary officials .
the incident could possibly be observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission is propos@@ ing a new court in dispute on TTIP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the resolution of the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement on TTIP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way con@@ forms significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström on the idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de must introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
through TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is to be created with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceeding envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the USA and from third countries .
for the first time , a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to raise obj@@ ections against judgment .
until now , the parties involved agreed with each other to arbitr@@ ators , there was no objection to their judgments .
in the discussion over the past few months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented .
in the long term , they want to work on an international investment court according to their own specifications .
there could then also be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states there .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceeding ( IS@@ DS ) demanded especially from large corporations is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parallel justice , by allowing companies to take damages of tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws , or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act described the EU Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Secretary of State Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission included significant points on the reform that Federal Economic Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel had worked out in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European corporate association Business@@ Europe warned against restric@@ ting the economic possibilities of the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the whole audience , about 40 people , is nearly caught by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of various places he repeatedly shows on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were created and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative Irish .
with the release published in 2003 and the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into the great opul@@ ent at any time .
the rum@@ our , &quot; Mich@@ igan , &quot; would be the first part of a distorted series : each of the 50 US states should follow in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reduced St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live meets him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a nationwide celebrated masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bri@@ mming with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic items .
this sixth full studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ b .
long ago the smaller clubs got up , the stage shows become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly mat@@ ured St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate in essence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected at the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire with suspen@@ se
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire and for the first time set up with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from the vicinity .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several title stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they were referring to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party was originally supported as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also stack@@ ed within Labour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour amendments set out to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and retired minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has since been T@@ ory leader over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who promised another policy set says he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s findings are too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he will refrain from both &quot; impact &quot; and the dispute with ad@@ versaries , and instead , focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minister , is represented if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally took the word and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the Lower House , to discuss the problem .
when he was leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy Theater , &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ aire . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questionnaire with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the Lower House and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms .

Po@@ und increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose mark@@ edly by data indicating an increase in the growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller building target .
between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and er@@ ased estimates of the time of an interest increase since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the takeover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry stocks were after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose by 5 % , after the mining giant said he took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sale as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put Sach@@ s his assessment of the company R@@ ating on sale .
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after having reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

not bad .
hundreds of fans watched Justi@@ n yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
however , since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .

the fans don &apos;t .
Bi@@ eber himself does not .
this has already taken care of .
for the advertisement in the advertising break of the super@@ hero , he collected three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ p firm donated many , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber account .
and with each doll which looks like he and above the counter , Bi@@ eber is also cas@@ hier .
if Justi@@ n Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , you will be amazed at the wind@@ screen .
more than 100 million people have been killed in such a way .
some say the hyp@@ e went too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is finally right in the United States and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at No. 1 .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os at first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to a potato @-@ pat@@ ter idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - and indeed in the Pot@@ ato B@@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the saying &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the shop has a barbecue meal , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has meanwhile passed the Lebanese patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
therefore , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash starts ground @-@ resistance campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branches off an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ resistance campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples distributed in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will release further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day .
there is a lot in the game , since South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries after opening its first markets and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in Eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan has found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and to reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction in sales and margins at the same time .
the wholes@@ aler , however , with@@ stands and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to boost sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week to improve their shops through fast growing fresh foods and deliver a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading remedi@@ ation programmes will be raised to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ burg and deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; fell into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s in@@ famous confrontation with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ator , Har@@ rison had to beat him , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he struck a tennis ra@@ cket , after winning a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I am rather event@@ ful is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is trained in the locker room , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account the important decision that begins on Friday , and it describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ burg &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick has done very quickly the ascent to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have made . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , in which he can only think about it , I think for appropriate , and it is best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declares the emergency stand and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to get illegal into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed when hundreds of migrants in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land re@@ acted and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations went up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against Hungarian stand@@ by police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some expelled from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc with a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be reconc@@ iled .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the un@@ shr@@ unken Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive additional 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put his hopes on a prompt action from Brussels or from his neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency stand launched on Tuesday in two Southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having ended a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail@@ ers were deployed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia became a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come up by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are able to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounding the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to manipul@@ ate the data of people and press a crowd to impose themselves there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he candidate for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is what candidates will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support among the men has fallen sharply , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
but Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections say nationwide that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the sel@@ ect@@ ability are also cited .
as the Vice @-@ President poses a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters of the Pre @-@ elections are asked who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top .
of Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be her second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders increases , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors emerged as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features in choosing the pre @-@ election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den best cuts in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic voters in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server will continue to be questioned during the term of office as foreign minister , most Democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was split in March , just after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was even worse .
it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them to an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the voting rights are also not tru@@ thful and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good sheet music .
from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son many do not think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 democratic voters in the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws near Donald Tru@@ mp on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is at the newest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , half of the voters support the new survey , and others lose a dramatic stop . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp nationwide in large numbers . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot at the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demo@@ graphics groups and sur@@ passes Tru@@ mp under republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , except C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ governor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell to the lowest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son climbs in the surveys - he lands with 19 % support from the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a look at the Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even though peak values are only measured in distance , bathing vac@@ u@@ bers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find warm water .
a bath in the north or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the north and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures still offers the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a sham@@ anic ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five persons were submitted .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police said .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to move across a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g became impot@@ ent and allegedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ o &apos;s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , he said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in general by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Police Chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has repeatedly been added to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs again .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died each year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the murder of the first five counts for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to make responsible persons responsible , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed raises interest
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an interest increase is coming , and the hous@@ ings are turned into fu@@ elling , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy is only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , albeit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the Central Bank have so viol@@ ently stressed that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather at the time needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement might have been exagger@@ ated due to a interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets from 12 to 24 months are estimated after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest rates of the F@@ ed .
more specifically , the market has been in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which Bob Dol@@ l , head of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increases cycle and the yield begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that have not existed before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw up the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If it is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants all year saw a rate increase of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essions are put into the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates interest rates , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
at bonds the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the cycle of raising the bond yields fell immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer cooperation between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interesting is that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending has increased , and volati@@ lity has risen - all features of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
in large and large companies that handle the larger part of their business activities in the US will benefit when interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multination@@ als with high debt will become worse , as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points after each of the rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity with their shares exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a major problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure share games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how quickly it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Euro MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the station because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cur@@ v@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins captured The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said it was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ enced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under another name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I think it &apos;s really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder is needed to engage the audience when it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show purchased by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in special BBC fashion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our own stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if it &apos;s the next time a series of entertainment star@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future or to give money to the pay @-@ pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down expenses
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now it comm@@ utes itself and we may experience that growth will dimin@@ ish .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for subsequent sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases from this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers worried about their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spending was issued a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 dead are borne by Muslims in the first burial places in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane at Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ z@@ ee collap@@ sed .
mour@@ ning , largely dressed in white , the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead arrived their last trip to the al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place where only days before a building crane went through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the worshi@@ ppers pl@@ ung@@ ed .
the corp@@ ses were approved for burial , when the Saudi king ruled over the construction company of the Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the catastrophe that also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 worshi@@ ppers who were killed as a crane tum@@ bled through the Great Central mo@@ cha of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to go to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to town .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree released by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ speaking service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company may be banned abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which collap@@ sed into a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the p@@ add@@ ling that took place later this month .
the Bin Laden group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project led by the bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a dr@@ unken son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay at the hospital .
government representatives ruled that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injuries receive half of this amount .

at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is asser@@ ted that Br@@ its put down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men who carry out the work in their home
if you are skill@@ ful with a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
because British increasingly employ craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new manager from King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ men and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the shop are met by women .
at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends that exhibit more female single households than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our stores .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to shift this stronger towards equilibrium . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company occupying exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the turnover after the Group deb@@ ated the costs for closing the shops .
due to the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball court A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and deportation education on Wednesday .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the accused found that the defend@@ ants were used for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011 .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial off@@ ences .
this fact was the chair@@ woman of the Sho@@ open Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the off@@ ence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence constituted that at no time an asset was created at any time .
the sports function@@ aries would have calculated only allowance damages and the sports club , for which they had invested a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? , &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the B@@ read profession large @-@ scale financial officer of the financial office .
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shed money , our life insurance is laid down as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the recording . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , there must be no debts .
furthermore , with the corresponding financial - success , the reimbur@@ sement of the expense allowance has been retro@@ active until 1991 .
this is why you have paid out a part of the allowance only years later , namely from the year 2003 , as a plus on the account has been paid out .
thus , the former Ob@@ server seemed to explain the events as well .
the accounts and the spar@@ es managed to administr@@ ate the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdrawal from the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial reinforcement , important be only debt free , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as in the year 2011 against which a function@@ ary investig@@ ator started investigations for office abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known according to the statement of the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent had no answer to this question for a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he believed that this was the best thing for the club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , justified himself by the function@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims settlement &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why indem@@ n@@ ity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary , he never referred to a cent salary , he merely calculated mil@@ eage and diets .
on diets , he was charged EUR 1,000 per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were unable to provide accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an operation , in which everything had been judged correctly , they explained .
the second defend@@ ant also referred to the mil@@ eage .
all the deport@@ ations were made in cash , and he said in his statement from his place of residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard st@@ alls more 30,000 jobs
in addition to personnel mining , which has been running for three years , the computer terri@@ ese will build further jobs at the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
the sub@@ missions on the U.S. computer terri@@ esen Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs of USD 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are expected to be saved on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share handed down 2.3 percent .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto group currently spl@@ its up with printers from the c@@ alifor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto : so the computer and printer business should be bund@@ led in a new company - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ appointing PC section as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services continued to be the second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer .
in the third quarter of July the sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under EUR 25.@@ 4 billion .
the proceeds went back to 15 of 16 quarters .
HP responds to changes in the industry with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smart phones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more businesses online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority support the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers to combat operations in Iraq would be mostly rejected : 54 per cent spoke out , 35 percent were agreed .
the fact that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria can be found 61 percent positive .
on the other hand , 24 per cent are to intervene in the conflict .
a cooperation with the Syrian government of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad reject 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be for this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 29 percent could not decide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
car : second day of the day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
at the heart of the fair , up to 27 September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility are at the centre of the fair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mobility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can visit the International Motor Show from Saturday .
the organisers of the V@@ DA Auto Association expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed several hundred refugees on the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water @-@ thro@@ wer .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violent erup@@ tion at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line and behind the polic@@ eman a water @-@ thro@@ wer was ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set up pe@@ pper@@ mint spray .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a bit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant woman and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas shri@@ mps .
other refugees sl@@ ammed in themselves and suffered from difficulty breathing .
the spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pe@@ pper@@ spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note
the world is watching if the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest has been raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists asked by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view that the F@@ ed will do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current stand will be 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed has set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may exit the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global relationships .
it warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
die Death schüt@@ z at the Delta State University
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; gave public authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot someone and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he told the staff of the emergency call center that police officers must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it .
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb went 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed in the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb called for relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police arrived at Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 Lamb received a doctoral degree from the Delta State University , as his life lau indicates on the university &apos;s website .
stars who lost their lucky charm

in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor has also said to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug possession .
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the Group restructuring the workplace .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is an earnings contribution of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will not be responsible for the passenger transaction in the future .
Euro@@ wing &apos;s cheap airline should be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the management team headed by Chef Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new creation , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
until now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was very complex .
the airlines operated under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the pilot agreement cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the scheduled strike on Thursday .
this divided the union with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of talks is to be the retirement regime for pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wants to come as soon as possible to achieve sustainable results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the interim supply of the pilots , the background is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it envis@@ ages that Lufthansa is shifting to the Group &apos;s own cheap line Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left foreign def@@ enders to cry and to exclude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was embedded into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then this happens .
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months and it will not play in the group stage .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red himself .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;

the UK def@@ enders have an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a quar@@ ry when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in another direction so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it almost mem@@ orized .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a child care system provider to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister opted for The Lor@@ ax , which was released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , rein@@ forces the content of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads , partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ ficially and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he agrees to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . here is an un@@ named boy , as the local environment hears through the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ tering , thri@@ ving once @-@ ler , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street Spe@@ aker said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral bure@@ au .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no further comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult .
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a for@@ wards victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks side may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related message : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England @-@ test @-@ cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ eers are geared to results .
there were no question marks with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , because - and I said this to - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago , he would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully turns further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test hammer gets to set up his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and reverse .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first set up Jonathan in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he &apos;s a drummer I highly appreciate .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket@@ eer , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and get four squ@@ cks , appeared , and I don &apos;t mind anything about it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mo@@ een perhaps did not get his job done for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Justi@@ n Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred races straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experiences , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the dressing room , even if the messages are in line with the previously said .
Coll@@ ey &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain from the EU ) could win if the economy is moving into a sl@@ um@@ ber by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ developed ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of ingeni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at and recently said that some member states , so deeply frustr@@ ated in various crises , as the EU is now and not always satisfied with their own blame , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they win alliances for reforms .
it &apos;s always around me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wants to look outside Britain inside the EU @-@ Zel@@ tes - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened in the exc@@ essively long res@@ ins like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain won &apos;t win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press cards , as they did not have during the referendum held by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ z @-@ Eurozone opport@@ uni@@ sts , who has made a name as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ odd ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who was his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , phone @-@ catching foreigners and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ foreigners who have the most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but he discovered that when sitting in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , they were better distributed to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never denied it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly hook on his back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he doesn &apos;t need more time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC couch he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I get it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ Ten@@ dency and the wild Gef@@ il@@ des of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ismus can certainly say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father worked on television to be loyal to his work colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and MPs on Monday evening on Monday evening .
whatever the stirring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a brood @-@ place of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ ee campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ ui@@ ties to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ ui@@ ties to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - in order to make concessions to the British , if this can be anything sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start on Monday , what British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was calling .
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing , which he should have received according to reports by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , added them .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which provide an industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ essed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted previously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by clari@@ fying current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ern@@ ames , says former head of Channel 4
the former leader of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ erly and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast charge should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ cont@@ ested time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC &apos;s Director General , Tony Hall , said that he wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly presented by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t think medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least keep your production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as broad support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ erly is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m tired of seeing how this is meant to be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence on the hunt for reviews is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give this again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue when they go to their sacred missions to justify four billion pounds of radio , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 CEO David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their historic mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said just little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example to inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain in the public television stations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on TV , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers enter alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound stimul@@ i .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound stimul@@ i that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms generally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and be found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when he turns ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with pul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered tissue and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago I became a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ leg@@ ged complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entry into student housing ranges from slightly nerve @-@ writing to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers were .
let people go .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not remember to start the Uni with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted obtain a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space bo@@ omer@@ ang culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
talking apro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship exclu@@ des through baking .
since you start the Uni at the height of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to introduce themselves to a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve made you a bit . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade sweets is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed ra@@ gs of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea ?
check with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a deterg@@ ent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , if it was a bit qui@@ eter for them to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more lu@@ ke@@ able music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep for two hours before she pl@@ ung@@ ed her own music , shut down her door and went to her three @-@ hour trial .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be utterly embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , to take care of them , separate yourself and see them every day and perhaps see how they over@@ lap all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your body a bit of reason .
in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his key in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an Ul@@ k and M@@ ob@@ bing is fine when it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never trust someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut down your door and place your keys into a glass of water that you then put in the freezer - but do not stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling anymore than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single persons , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the servant servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well @-@ built today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushed onto the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner expects to know how quickly appropriate housing can be created : he builds homes for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need sufficient living space over the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you put the people in blocks of housing .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can be converted easily to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have completed my project correctly .
it is particularly complicated that it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch regulation .

it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only educational mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er .
I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well @-@ built today .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , tap &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are recommended to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may possibly mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to delete the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is completed .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone could possibly switch to half way and this could result in a breakdown of the update .

the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation received by Chief Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to include chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .
youth work and talent search are also to be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of its connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined the Social Foundation &apos;s man@@ tle and opened a new focal point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations , one can also participate in courses there .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office recently opened .
from now on , directly next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and install@@ ers receive information on questions such as care insurance or services of health care and nursing homes .
for years now , we have established our ambul@@ ant care service that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone .
there are an endless number of questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , too many benefits of the insur@@ ances are not taken into account , because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health and wellness .
to do this , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physio@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , precau@@ tion and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association agreement at the age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite you to be a regular contribut@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 pm .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang 92 years old died
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus shared on Tuesday .

born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager .

in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the name of the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men examined 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 year old Afghan , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was located at the level of the b@@ ft station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man and struck this with his fist .
the victim suffered a no@@ stri@@ ome break and bleeding strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first dropped off his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their home and found there demonstr@@ atively several times over there .
when one no longer saw the vehicle , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the aid of a head@@ stock , you put on the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
so far there is only a vag@@ ue tat@@ too description .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
also , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ ce@@ breaks on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on the side with his successor in the coming months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the ri@@ ms met years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll who is currently completing her vocational training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the Müll@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far I simply called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with practice .
they still live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a Senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is engaged in the D@@ RK @-@ prepar@@ edness frac@@ tional Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both Inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a house@@ wife .
&quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the reconstruction , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ bearing EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50,000 euros is given by the Müll@@ ers within the scope of a funding programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , about 2000 patients come to practice field breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practical takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no follow@@ er had been found , she would have gone too .
who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s talk hour , inci@@ dentally also looks at familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning force of the ri@@ ms .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she felt a little melanchol@@ y after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and travels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also driven up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as above , it is clear that anyone who wants to put a asylum application can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people are in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear also that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , also not over the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia considers &quot; Kor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia denied
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to travel to Austria and Germany , and may also er@@ ect corri@@ dors for refugees .
however , this was not the case in Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the supervision of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to keep its borders for refugees but not abrasion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to pass the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the near corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has ever been meeting police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with about 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media consistent on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was to make people aware of certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made it , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could actually lead to the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call for details , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently proven a good testimony to the country , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to appe@@ ase Wednesday morning at a local appearance in Hor@@ gos , keeping the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distributing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock market h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who have been accused of having gained insight into even un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the captured information should have been made on the financial markets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insi@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our borders are ultimately trapped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said in the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 additional accus@@ ations continued in the case .
most of the defend@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .

the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce made aware of her 20 @-@ year existence with this action and looks quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ Aid is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as the volunteer staff .
while some pedestri@@ ans spontaneously access the chal@@ k and set the set to &quot; stop my life , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are little discussions about the action in themselves , about life , dealing with death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only if I realize that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Mannheim plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce .
this is why this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
however , that not everyone wants to communicate openly to the tables , but be understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still adher@@ ed to tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped many people open up .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook reduced for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the Gi@@ ant Gig@@ ant lowered his earnings outlook for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a gain between 10.@@ 40 $ and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year that ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous pre@@ diction .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view results in spite of the price increases , which are 4.@@ 9 percent on average and effective on the 4th of January , and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ water transports of heavy and large packages , which will be lifted from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result was increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company gains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday occupation were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million US $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six analysts predicted analysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , bringing sales in its unit express delivery to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result declined due to higher labor costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares were dropped by 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days of this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the glue for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening over them at the end of the decorated , two @-@ storey se@@ ater hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision which is too tight for predic@@ ting it . it is announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned by the unprecedented incentive through the short @-@ term interest rate at the end of 2008 .
although most data on the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets would make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they watch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself to the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists who were recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate increase this week .
however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mitig@@ ate the strike by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage jumped at 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets , so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate would calm the financial markets , because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world joined the end of last month , after China had utilized its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle the global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , and the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the level of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation , when one should increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would put the re@@ ins at this session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former US staff member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; O@@ liner said .
the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be considered technically in its decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
the mere notice of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow up its monetary expansion &quot; triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected that they will not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ er , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest rates , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its cad@@ ins by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives returned these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a heavy crisis like the market collapse in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the Bank of England &apos;s interest fixed .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where she is afraid of a interest rate because the markets upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Life Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
preparing a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
with her 74 L@@ enses she still likes to teach .
every Thursday they do it at the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course , this is quite different than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS is trying to enligh@@ ten women on how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck on breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should carry out .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ini Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited gymn@@ asi@@ um construction at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : during the recent municipal council meeting , the completed building application was unanim@@ ously approved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee had previously decided to apply for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the current planning plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ centered first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation that is required for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will significantly reduce the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was necessary because the construction plan for the til@@ ting of the roof does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ ini municipal council usually rather restric@@ ts in the case of liber@@ ating orders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots promotion .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the Land Registry Office .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Land@@ rä@@ tin Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will take place on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au by fishermen and the further existing interior station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed about the plans .
the change has been triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who was supposed to succeed , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership from October 1st and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this would be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree to both houses , until next year the former hospital of the scar@@ city , which still has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years .
until now , the administrative district has planned this for 2018 , when the current rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , advoc@@ ates that the house , which is owned by the Federal Government , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a tag@@ esp@@ a psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi Mo@@ ving to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .

hunting event with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their corn harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were employed as the police admitted .
after a shot , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the crimin@@ al@@ poli@@ z@@ ei is determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the youngsters were killed and their corp@@ ses were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the corp@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as public prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday .
in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday evening is considered to be a suspect , and the fact that he was evi@@ den@@ ced and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the corp@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit to Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first found the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquaintances , a crime was finally found against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the corp@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities told the authorities to have killed 16 @-@ year @-@ olds and put the dead bodies in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be led to the Haf@@ ner on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead .
the further investigation should be carried out on the immediate circumstances of the action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution gri@@ ds on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the verb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany .
there@@ with there are 14@@ 0.000 dwell@@ ings .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many then come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers in the last year lived for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant savings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a deficit that will grow from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ 0.000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compla@@ ining Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore stayed in large cities without penet@@ rating into WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained invol@@ un@@ tarily longer in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the noise on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has declined again for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should boost the social housing construction .
this could be wai@@ ved on the real estate tax and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be temporarily suspended .
moreover , according to the Alliance , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary .
the funding programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the Kf@@ W state bank is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start was up on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros already more than half of the available around 300 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia establish Cor@@ ri@@ dor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary is practically no transit , since more and more refugees are choosing the way over Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to grant the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the sealing of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws which came into force on the same day , moreover , do not require proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbourhood .
most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees do not encounter a border fence .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 9@@ 0s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but after the closure of the border no more refugees are coming to Hungary .
on Tuesday the police had 3@@ 66 un@@ challenged people .
shortly before Tor@@ tage on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy the overcoming and damage of the Grenz@@ z@@ a@@ uns as a crime .
in the southern Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; transit zones &quot; - almost all - 93 - at the most important crossing of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stopped there .
practically no one has granted a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
they gathered the garbage which tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barrier screens were disman@@ tled and one of the recording managers in the Grenz@@ ort was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary only few refugees reach Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government figures .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge firm on Sunday , when ten people were suddenly standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go to Passa@@ u by train .
on Sunday , however , because of the influ@@ x of refugees with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and picked up the bri@@ st@@ les along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border to the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first saw the un@@ hoped @-@ by guests , with snack and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; that was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers climbed from an ICE in a regional train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in order to try after the short @-@ term announcement that the railway traffic was stopped to Germany , but still to try the border .
however , the regional train was shut down at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border crossing generally is high in the course .
the Bridge @-@ Festival was soci@@ able with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday , the day before a two @-@ leg@@ ged race is sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp to help build structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has publicly and publicly tra@@ cked the attitude of the Hungarian government into the ha@@ ze circle of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to notice that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for vulnerable seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 win@@ try districts
Konrad has to do all the hands with the refugee support .
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place quot@@ as for thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos in the former recep@@ tion@@ ist Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already managed to get a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , who had come to Austria on Monday , was without great vor@@ tex , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior , however , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 lod@@ gings have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 will be able to provide 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial captains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him to create quot@@ as for the coming refugees too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it runs well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also puts great expectations into the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping wie wir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels which are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that the source enco@@ ders must adhere to a certain height of the hand towel holders or the size of the overhead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of Interior in the accommodation , he founded Konrad with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face the un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier don &apos;t charge the Republic as they explained themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
up to now , the company &apos;s own source search has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since it is possible to accommodate those affected currently without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other sites should be examined for their suitability .
critics are critic@@ ised by the city chief on the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts have to make their contribution here too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an extended telep@@ hon@@ y with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) will act on Monday for further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the appropriate border controls .
sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article .
however , the guar@@ dians would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again called for more reinforced solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , a logical consequence &quot; from the German approach to P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger is that now Austria also introduces new controls .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Verk@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology Division .
&quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later also to acquire them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
€ 1.7 million have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is considered by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ credi@@ tor opened second business in the arcade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of the new shop .
in fact , Jutta Bre@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to hand over the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop vis @-@ à @-@ vis the store in which she sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I wondered if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a place where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the great area of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who himself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has put her mother in the cra@@ dle of her mother .
most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture can also not answer the professional woman with the last security .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag is upgraded every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called len@@ ders .
this property also connects people with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for upright .
whether he is alien@@ ating himself from foreign , journalists or vulner@@ abilities in international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presi@@ dency makes the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öh@@ n@@ fresh@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 inhabitants place are related to it via -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed by their K@@ all@@ stadt art , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous offspring , to which apart from Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) as well - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also tend that Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too high German : the enco@@ der , she says .
Tru@@ mp therefore comes from the village of the enco@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold graves in the USA .
first real estate purchases in New York were the corner@@ stone of the real estate company .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to the homeland for a long time , failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
he did not pick up Tru@@ mp because he once was he@@ eded without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Geschichte und Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tru@@ mp ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born @-@ born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ em@@ aker in retirement sees the Americans rather distant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ ittle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension host Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz &apos;s family donated something for the church organ , which was generally well ank@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t get the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wouldn &apos;t have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the president of Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tru@@ mp was inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12@@ ,000 cinema fans , also in the US awak@@ ens the interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the Austrian Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there are no major shifts in the Today reviews .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the German capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase compared to ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
in August Today , Today , Today , 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 was .
in September , Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these mor@@ nings more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had asked if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , gave an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) jumped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators , and in the second half an hour s@@ ated 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will eventually prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute which did not manage to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s .
the woman , finally landing at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was envel@@ oped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before being made out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally give an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed up to the final on Thursday
all three women have inspired the ly@@ rical manner of why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods final rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be their answers to the game killing who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed energies ( Sar@@ ahs ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on &apos;s Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit made her clear last week that Wood &quot; may be the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly tuned to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the b@@ achel@@ or will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .
originally published as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a don@@ key as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ts on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ ts@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his rap@@ ed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens once , you only care about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut in 2007 when a pass led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
all in all , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ agra@@ m .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free Elec@@ tors demand the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn , party and fac@@ tion@@ ist Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get compensation in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag faction of the Free Elec@@ tors conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually , quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now also dominated by the Free Elec@@ tor Meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , as was the case during the Yugosla@@ v wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need nationwide uniform standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is shifting away , others are not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to be able to act more effectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy should not fall under the table in large @-@ wall city .
a long @-@ standing torch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , cult Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; in order to extend the secondary school level from three to four years .
but that is not far enough Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all high schools that want to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 anywhere where it is desired .

in the US , the Dow Jones Index recently noted about 1 percent in the plus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock markets expect the markets to be replaced until after the interest decision in the US and also to the large decline in the fut@@ ures trade on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the discussion around the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has temporarily de@@ pressed the RW@@ E shares to a record low and left deep traces even at E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros in provisions .
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .

according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; looked after the weekend .
accordingly , investors of the German chip@@ maker have now paid too little attention .
investment in future waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .

4 People killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , among them a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police shot rubber floors in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used tear gas and then shot into the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rubber floor .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets known to be able to kill them , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law@@ makers voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be restored .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metres surface .
a mixture of trade , trade and living is planned , but there are no concrete proposals .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market some 4000 square meters of land in direct neighbourhood to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and living .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city .
which investor would come into question is not yet clear .
however , no contracts were concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property that is located at the Ring@@ straße / Corner Great Street , just a few months ago and let the building be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement at the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
many An@@ gli@@ ders are still wor@@ rying - they fear the sale of their leisure @-@ fu@@ gi@@ um
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement are located near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ den Council &apos;s urban development committee .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach went on to the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we haven &apos;t yet answered any questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects have been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners , who had come to the meeting , highlighted the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , marine owner and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like a number of other project critics that the traffic would increase strongly by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus loads to be reck@@ oned with , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the construction plans are still variable .

Google launches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ation Campa@@ ign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google Inc . O ) announced a double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the Don@@ ation call on its blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled up to $ 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many were also fle@@ eing from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .
coverage of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
weight loss surgery can be helpful for overweight diabe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after losing weight loss surgery longer live than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery which wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are deemed obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach cancer - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation declined from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition worsen@@ ed completely and at 28 % in part .
in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , the diabetes was only one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater dec@@ lines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have firmly associated their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , at school times un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries can be created , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set up violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which swal@@ lows strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection agents , says the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 were reported to report the poison control centers , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them land in emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children abst@@ ain from disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants , only a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p whis@@ key around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ hai@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry fra@@ grant dis@@ infection in the school , was brought to the treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold which is legally drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ hai@@ jah had her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ hai@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with fat@@ alities .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities employees suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ an &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; said a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and banned them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the sl@@ ated plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross @-@ pole in the direction of the industrial area and was too late , that two driving vehicles had stopped at the roundabout .
as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a standing Ford Fi@@ esta .
the accident involving the accident involving accidents of about 10,000 euros was caused by the police .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready and had to be tow@@ ed .

there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was spontaneously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates do not stand under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of cover competition in Scottish football te@@ es Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers @-@ Mittel@@ feld player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
you are talking about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Firm Games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic will have to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which is now clearly ahead of the table with five points lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the player better .
getting together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously with January transfer
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , who pointed out that he made a few January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in summer have this season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic destination Mich@@ u with reference card
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le for two years and has not managed the departure from Wales this summer .
hear@@ ts set to S@@ FA battle due to N@@ eil@@ bad &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field , and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of Defender was later abol@@ ished - the third red card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains with what he has said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no power commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rup@@ tible Hi@@ bee was re@@ proved after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is safe to say that I do not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s management team has confidence in the management team to turn things down - but it is , however , that the decline must end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es happy to &quot; win &quot; against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team had to fight for Hamilton Ac@@ cies in desper@@ ation to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points in front of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no team that has won everything in poker games or li@@ lies that have won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it increases overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the UK@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent over the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken disrup@@ ting the process
since the security personnel could not satisfy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pe@@ pper@@ spray the officials could take the stur@@ geons in custody .
a breathing alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,@@ 89 pro@@ mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2.@@ 15 pro@@ mil@@ le and initially remained in custody .
why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January over his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day came closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as often more applications are available as places , a more mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery will take place to decide who will be elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed me to take a not@@ ebook and a pencil to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have form@@ ulate it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had a problem with some of the things I &apos;ve said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to which you can turn to this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he over@@ spoke the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed on Tuesday to a house arrest incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , they tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the tren@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired natives to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he focused on the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria Integr@@ ity Unit and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the race sport and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt t@@ amp@@ y test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ gations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up my head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had raised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eighte@@ en months Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - I &apos;m going to name - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly put themselves in their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to grasp me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should I think that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have cow@@ ard@@ ly behavior and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they are now thinking about it now .
but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will exercise pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the training levels of the trainer have set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known due to his preparation of the un@@ slaugh@@ tered Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the day @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse debate , which was contrary to the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been so yesterday evening .
it would have been the whole day all day , which was so .
but it also had the same on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the day of the race . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we went too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals due to claims to ring fights back
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ire players have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett did a little disgu@@ ised comment on the Storm team after his team achieved final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the cr@@ ass of his crew and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; when tac@@ kling the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was confi@@ dently speaking to him , because they were worried that they were worried about being hit by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights when they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this always appears at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrilling soccer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne talks about exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of it .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have these kinds of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play as they can .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are there breaks and no points are something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm @-@ Team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit on drugs deposit
a man who possibly threatened a lifel@@ ong punishment due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the yacht harbour during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal complaint , he lied to the police concerning his where@@ ab@@ outs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ ous explanations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released from the security deposit under the conditions that he gave his Australian and Serbian passport to the police every day and sat at an exit from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tear apart
a truck driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday evening with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent building site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape to the left at the last moment , as the police hur@@ ried .
the driver &apos;s cab is completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed over six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone from girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ er used the phone of an 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when this was asleep , lo@@ aned into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the confusing messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police looked around and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches which used terms for searching for un@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophil@@ es on the internet &quot; and he then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer from him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused took advantage of computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the indictment , to have taken un@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , to have been viol@@ ated on 25 January this year , and did not appear before the court hearing on 24 March this year .
defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Registry of sexual offen@@ ders since one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; is found in his case .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael prescri@@ bes the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted deposit in this case , but was held in custody for other cases due to hear@@ ings in other cases .
he was admitted before the date of judgment into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user switches on small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are picked up apart from the big control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many people left fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river river Inn in Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were walking over bridges and st@@ ow@@ els to the German side .
there they will be received by the Federal Police and forwarded to the registration .
more refugees arrived at the Munich Central Station in comparison to the week &apos;s start on Wednesday .
around 700 people were arriving in the capital city alone until 8 : 00 , said a speaker in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : runner from tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm o@@ aks in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
because of a low @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , hot marine air is currently in the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
the powerful Deep is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic during the last days .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D it is still to be reck@@ oned up early in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ seek@@ er with bu@@ ds from 60 to 90 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometres .
on Friday we can see the sun again .
the mass makes it : every two years the car builders show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , there is mainly movement among the compact cars that currently sell particularly well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations fell to this segment alone in August , according to the German Federal Office ( KBA ) .
this is reflected in the IAA ( public days September 17 - 27 ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand by dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the brand &apos;s core .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel is launching an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf in view , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only a five @-@ door car .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will be added to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra rival Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an accentu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bo .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Law of Justice Te@@ gel that was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the judges may even hope for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a prison facility in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on the open foot , had been moved to a larger cell .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , his arrest warrant because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
however , the judges raised the judgment of the Court of Appe@@ al in Berlin and returned the case to the re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for compensation were decisive , a compensation claim was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a disgu@@ ise of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of money damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
thus they only said in April a prisoner of damages because he was locked in a cell naked in a cell .
according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , Dec@@ ent Dec@@ ision of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel incident in November 2009 .
the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case over three months .
over the past few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come to the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even in fights , it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not staff@@ ed because of the lack of young talent , 19 shall fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do that , and we do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are used annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : every year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister of Building Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing annually would have to be created and the Federal Government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
scientists and federal states agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find employment in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the intake society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of migrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise labour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the residence obligation to restrict asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society , too , because of the shortage of skilled workers , the view of the labour market has increased in majority a way that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lack of German knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and occupational language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated by personal contacts .
for this reason , the building of networks is therefore the king &apos;s road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents , it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ lio , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
however , in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators is increased by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students are prepared in the lessons without any knowledge of the German language .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state does not prohi@@ bit asylum seekers or tolerated studies - the only exception was Berlin , the internal sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or debt will not receive any services according to the asylum application law more if they begin studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , the latter do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ o@@ iled persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
however , this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively sweep the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state churches right to a new state religion relationship .
the establishment of an Islamic well @-@ being association would also be important to take care of the newcom@@ ers .
rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Muslim Central Council , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to au@@ ge such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , reducing discrimination and racism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ murder series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same opportunities for all : what migration organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and what international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention Germany have to commit to , must become reality in the next few years , if the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far , says physician president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needed to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery requests to susp@@ end all arri@@ vals in the registration of health cards .
services rendered could later be accounted for by the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to extract as many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum application law provides .
otherwise , the doctors make the most of the language barriers .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in physician offices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over .
many refugees have also been helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
in refugee camps , for example , there is much more un@@ treated disability , and in the young people it is about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment .
with the partially other disease pictures German doctors come from their training but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ est@@ ation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the don@@ or is possibly even relief in sight of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill after estimates of the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the University of Munich confirms that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder are suffering from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social @-@ offices generally non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst picks up the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on the tile .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - this is the motto of the current management stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for lovers lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to bring people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen cocktail with world city flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to take it loose .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ons , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and articul@@ ation .
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake @-@ people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with its mot@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; Stephan@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a topic for various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , it is not good for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read from the eyes upon the possibility of every desire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
the first commandment is : care for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ ra jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all our hearts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites its performances every day from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are dis@@ counted .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped down the stairs from a podium in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by statements by members of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ asing .
in the past month they had bor@@ rowed him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones , who warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of Parliament that the immunity in parliament ends and once they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing corporate hardware and service activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before , in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ matched , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; said the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to produce electric systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates have to face the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario implies that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the European Championship will certainly remain uncertain in the next summer .
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it did not stand in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsenal &apos;s 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most of the vulner@@ ability stage .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a possible period of time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger is a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and allow the players who need to take a little break @-@ up break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to go forward by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where the Richter scale was measured 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and is driven by far @-@ away hope to lead the association to its first European triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked with arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to the need for men to open themselves , now more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high level .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a miserable life ) announced in 2015 as the Year of Man , with the aim of asking the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noticed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication through social media , with their emphasis on style and substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lifel@@ ong and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one by interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football coaching in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to each case , even though they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a staff of telephone counsel@@ ing , I explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ murdered , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the completely re@@ designed setting to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink at Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .

angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against Swedish masters , as they do not only strive for the qualification for the kno@@ ck @-@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ected over the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris @-@ Team , which last weekend was 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing @-@ storm was called the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he ended up in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind Malm@@ ö &apos;s defense before he passed to Johan Wil@@ and beautifully into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who struck Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined nine national players on the field with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field lined up a heavy opponent .
but except for a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little to attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes got up , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scrat@@ ched in the first half alone and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had put it after the restart .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth round of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result low before substitute players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we played only in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects $ 2.5 billion through share sales
the mining giant glomer@@ ate Gl@@ en@@ core , which is based in Switzerland , has collected 2.5 billion $ by a stock sale as part of its huge school student plan on Wednesday .
the company Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , stated in an explanation that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds to pay its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , fights with falling raw materials prices , since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
in the early Wednesday morning , the issue of reference rights brought a rapid rise to the head of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning .
the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
last week Gl@@ en@@ core announced the 2.5 billion $ stock sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw materials prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ p@@ ings &apos;s visit to Washington
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and re@@ plying President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be host of Xi &apos;an and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner after the two leaders have led bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President xis visit will offer the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi will give the opportunity to approach areas of dis@@ agreements constructive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before coming to New York City at the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi will address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
apparently a few years ago the FC Bayern was just before the engagement of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times tro@@ phy , four times Champions League winner , twice Club World Champion , twice European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi advises that he was already before the Euro 2008 before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered office of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s Play@@ time 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi was standing for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the grass , turned the Red ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown under@@ scored the need for alternative perspectives and in reference to a black prot@@ agonist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted , with insul@@ t un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Marti@@ an sounded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to invite people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to treat the character of the harmony &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Brown first said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a n@@ ut@@ te beaten by her white watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People set out for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something we do not want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 list@@ ings since its publication .
women &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured content .
in February , the singer Prince made a recording on the movement while introducing the nominated albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums still have their meaning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation as a response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already made the Pope , is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional climbing clim@@ ber and assistant Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the contest show , which just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the fin@@ als .
the last task was climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to finish the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock about winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t get any prize money .
according to the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life is changing , it receives the great ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had exchanged roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit tiger sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tiger .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins spent a chance to climb within a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card square .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad P@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at the bull@@ pen any game , and so I want to go into the game quite concentrated .
the designated tiger hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit song by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on 6 July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the Schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( kick training ) , looked much better out in the bull@@ pen and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back of the seventh inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second ba@@ z@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who vent@@ ures a Two Run away from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the first in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a Double Play
at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings Detroit added a Insurance Run , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ hand man , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit prof@@ ited to the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after having missed more than a month due to a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches da in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third ba@@ z@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers placed in the second one , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not strike very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch @-@ count , did not score any points in the third inning before replaced by the rel@@ ic@@ t right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three races at six hits and a walk with four strokes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the limbs .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; San@@ che@@ z , since middle of August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder distortion , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP has painted Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability to launch against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he was missing on the right hip joint since August 20 .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be signed in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the most enriched people are then to be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the City Wiesbaden ha@@ sten@@ ed on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital were prepared for this case over the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily perish .
they are then to be distributed to other municipalities .
over the past ten days , according to the government president responsible for the first time , 7@@ 500 people in Hessen have arrived in Hessen .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective im@@ par@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup of military involvement passed in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening at the Austrian TV station ORF , to Hungary nobody will be sent back .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Safety and Represent@@ atives of Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concrete figures did not call them and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come across the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not been able to agree on joint action in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who would need protection , also complain .
but if you don &apos;t have a pencil , you can &apos;t stay in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this opinion was strongly divided in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
in the night of Tuesday , Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border with Serbia .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced to set up the border with Romania with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from escap@@ ing from Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of other migrants arrived on the way to the Greek border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sw@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , the moon sw@@ ung easily on his orbit around the ring plan@@ ed .
although this exchange movement is only small , but nevertheless too large for a continuous cel@@ estial body , it is stated in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technical sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ on at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , sp@@ it the water vap@@ or and ice particles , thereby feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Munich Lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to be four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sport director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential obligation of a uni@@ less professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slim line will often turn away from them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. How@@ ever , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support ey@@ esi@@ ght , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ go should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to hearty dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison .

first gro@@ aning tower , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland shared on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and at night to th@@ urs@@ day , the f@@ öhn wind blows partly through the fo@@ als .
after F@@ öh@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of a comprehensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong south @-@ western current .
on the alpine side of the Alps it breaks through the valleys during the night to the Wednesday of the F@@ öhn .
as a result , the F@@ öhn wind up to the th@@ urs@@ day morning in the valleys with arches of 60 to 100 km / h , partly and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can be penet@@ rated to the adjacent centre and on the mountains even or@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair @-@ dryer ensures summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture begins to st@@ ow on the mountain slope .
here is a rain that lasts until th@@ urs@@ day evening .
in total , the South of the Alps has to be calculated in the next 48 hours with partly over 100 litres of rain per square meter , which after the last few days already large rainf@@ all have fallen .
on Thursday morning the blow dri@@ es out , as a result a cold front rolls with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind refresh@@ es strongly to stor@@ my , and temperatures rise significantly .
the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand it is sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of City President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could live as a minority often only in secret their faith .
the place will be visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a com@@ promised sin @-@ ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions should have reinforced him by historians in his later struggle against Rome .
then Luther introduced the split of the Western Church with his theses against the waste trading .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with magnificent images .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which by no means is syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adjusted to the respective topics , it can be quite ble@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that dev@@ ote themselves to themes such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments , or pat@@ ernity .
with this he immediately fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on painting with the respective Bible passages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original biblical quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately a cataly@@ st for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant parish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened once with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to bring me back to the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern was to revi@@ ve art in a faster time : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is today shaped by advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have some secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall into the images &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but also chosen the most important , also mysterious themes for him .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; a picture Bible was created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X ( BM@@ X )
plans made , place found , companies were commissioned to model ground level for a circular course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finished again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration ensured dr@@ uss , especially among the residents who did not want the train to tolerate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill deported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will take place in October , the first joint @-@ mate Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees from 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the worsen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy its help in cop@@ ing with the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say that in principle , I don &apos;t think of anything , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chancellor &apos;s office and meet the Minister of State , Ms. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could and will help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must place the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this weekend , the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ chef Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama of refugees goes to everyone , nobody is allowed to look away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football federal states , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the League &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the Euro qualification match against Hungary this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large collective work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ ences in their places would have started their own projects was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government will provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO lo@@ oses an eye in case of accident
Chairman of the Board of Directors of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in early July .
in the case of the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a glass jar after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost blood @-@ bloo@@ ded , impot@@ ent , he got out of the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully work@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to stand up again when you fell down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ der f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group play of the Europa League have finally broken .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load of his professionals , Tu@@ va will not only change his stem from the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the go@@ al@@ keeper &apos;s position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of master @-@ keepers Roman natur@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europe @-@ league games , however , Tu@@ va was open .
with a high probability , he will also be able to contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ ging statement by Mit@@ gam@@ er R@@ eus that the final move for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , the middle @-@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl considers it understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants pioneering role for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the br@@ ink of the Autom@@ esse IAA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio .
for testing new technology , a test track is currently underway on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to make use of the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged man as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically feasible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are expected to be expected not until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the location Germany value the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around € 8.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still see scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday on behalf of Prü@@ for@@ gan@@ isation Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it at all in 20 years .
in France , 21 per cent of respon@@ dents estimate up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey across all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could be 15 percent , in traffic jam 45 percent .
well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .

the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the disadvantage is , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Single @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from 18th September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially neg@@ li@@ gible attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ ater . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s far @-@ looking oeu@@ vre that has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was carried out : to fr@@ inge the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated .
14 tons of material have returned to Munich according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , delicate fashion designers of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents couldn &apos;t have allowed him .
he later taught the throwing of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course .
for his first own fashion show he didn &apos;t have to pay the models .
they got nothing but could keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of a curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ niche
earlier it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in a large quantity for customers who used them for example to cover ceilings and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ vers P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the lu@@ te lace , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styles , is an increasing customer potential .
anyone who has no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
we already have half of all orders with us .
in cooperation with nine other companies , Mo@@ vers P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Point and Sti@@ cker@@ eien .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of the turnover has been broken away .
private specialist shops and also wholesale stores are almost no longer .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
today , the bulk material is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , the export is weak@@ ening , currently to Russia and to the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger outdoor office of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , we have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that have to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design often only varies slightly to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter recre@@ ated the historical snow@@ ball .
the machine sticks to small spheres in some places .
the P@@ lau@@ d gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; before , I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ dry lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and would like to have a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener summit .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends should not be touched , but Disney dar@@ es to find a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , according to the entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; is not a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director already stands firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wide to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should engage in attracting foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Group for the deep@@ ening of comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new start @-@ ups and push forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; Xi said .
the management board has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list for regulating the access to market , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
according to the statement , a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments .
the system is tested and tested by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it has a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also l@@ ure inspections on the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the ri@@ ghtful interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law of lawyers to ensure their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also attended Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ limit value in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to allow consumers to expect a significantly higher dose of the nerve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has received a corresponding EU work paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , big predat@@ ory fishes are already so strongly charged with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already observe the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sin@@ king in Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal for humans , which strongly accumulate over the food chain , especially in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry stated on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations meet more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide crossed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
