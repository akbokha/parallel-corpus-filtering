Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed is also to be discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for many years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington is critici@@ zing Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and re@@ jects Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the deal promoted by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Party in front of the US Congress , which was partly classified as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election in Israel with reference to the election .
Professor to have shot his girlfriend in an emergency call
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told us that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officers found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand written note , which was on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that lamb eventually made the fatal emergency call afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were happy about his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy mean that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not give him a guarantee of an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trace when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he did his doctorate in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 , when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were mol@@ ten when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously a few times together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played one or the other gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings its own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertaining co @-@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar close to Gau@@ tier , said that he saw lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . September last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic play in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were sitting and jo@@ king together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of humour .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Fr . Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community on a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the demonstration watch , while the University choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that he described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his distress call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it was planning to employ 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . 4@@ 5,000 employees were hired during the Christmas season 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will begin with job interviews and the number of employees from October to December is increasing .
while the holidays are still a few months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shops with employees that sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and I &apos;m gradually real@@ ising that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts and it comes to mind that I am a simulated gn@@ aw@@ ing and an arm &apos;s length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ str@@ it@@ tig the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN chief again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States , Russia , China , the UK and France - on the br@@ ink of meeting the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as flop .
others have dismissed it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks at p@@ olls , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them even won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mps staying power and start letting their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some recent survey values suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now , six out of ten re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enth@@ used &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see Tru@@ mps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of the Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number counts in the first electoral state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and nearly six of ten independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament won &apos;t fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters become accustomed to the idea .
if they expose their scholarship @-@ hats , republi@@ can voters keep Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten states that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money at J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it is clear that a variety of GO@@ P voters view Tru@@ mps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp still beats almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp leadership , whereas the anti @-@ trust support is spread across more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is re@@ aping the majority support .
he has a lead ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T pol@@ l on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half the voters support Tru@@ mp say they have for@@ given their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is the strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are dou@@ bly so frequent for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rapi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse was in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are concerned that Tru@@ mp &apos;s bom@@ b@@ astic terms of expression will be able to keep His@@ panic Americans far away from the Republi@@ can Party and humili@@ ate the new @-@ orientation efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues .
so long as the immigration is in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to be doing it .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders .
six out of ten re@@ public@@ ans say in the New Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider to someone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; poll@@ uted . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt und Co . : the five most exclusive resi@@ dences in Germany
the most expensive residential complex , with a view over the North Sea , is located here in the home of the garden .
on the street , a square meter of a flat roof building costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bus in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ el has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dencies - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro ni@@ x - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : sometimes Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ Dream@@ start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ po@@ ke in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to FC Bayern for a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ raeus . then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have embark@@ ed on a dream start in the &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; to the FC Bayern in the witch chair of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es matches ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth stage success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where in the third run Guardi@@ ola will finally reach the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller won his 28th event in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership of good assistance from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who allowed him to pass as a flan@@ k of the mayor &apos;s shot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm was promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated concept , without shining .
Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the Royal class , including some famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European teams with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went courage@@ ously , but in their aggressive endeav@@ ors they were often too in@@ ventive .
the attacks were often initiated by reloc@@ ation to the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which was seldom passed against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ gl@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion for@@ gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half one .
first of all , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ es head@@ ball from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct tak@@ e@@ off , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee ( 35@@ th ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant play , Pi@@ raeus could set con@@ i@@ fers .
but Manuel Neu@@ er was in charge of Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er .
for example , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye over the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er guar@@ dian ran a qu@@ atri@@ ot with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , back in the cad@@ re after muscular problems , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero was given the green light only after the final session , said Chief Executive Officer Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to do something else from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the le@@ ased Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Ar@@ ma@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still sat on it .
in front of the game , it was in the stadium to Kra@@ v@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bavaria fans in their audience block evi@@ dently had prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ raeus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich @-@ based supporters .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : when dispens@@ ing , the risk drops rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several collabor@@ ators of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the gum , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress .
smoking and loss of teeth therefore go back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment goes back to the level of non @-@ smokers , explains Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , stated study director H@@ einer Boeing from the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and containers and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health right up to old age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness has been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking lowers the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
archae@@ ologists stum@@ ble on lef@@ to@@ vers from the late Anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s banks of the Rhine
for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historic buildings have excav@@ ated , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
for all construction projects in the district of Cologne , the museum is always consul@@ ted as a department of archaeological excav@@ ation .
in the third construction section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists found it now .
from text documents , it was already known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves had been discovered , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman captured by freight train
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a young woman is unhappy at the station in the ghost @-@ ir@@ chen lin@@ ders , the federal police asks the population to help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 a.m. the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the railway station and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
according to the Federal Police , it has carried the he@@ avi@@ est injuries to it by recording the train .
it was treated with emergency medical care and brought to a hospital by ambul@@ ance personnel .
on the basis of the noc@@ turn@@ al crossing of the young woman there are no re@@ aliz@@ ations to the middle @-@ class officials .
the incident could possibly have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
local residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ aker weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .
information about the cause of the accident can be given at around the clock and free hot@@ line of the federal police under telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station .
European Commission proposes new court in dispute on TTIP
in order to mitig@@ ate the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its mode of operation corresponds to considerably more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de must introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
by TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world is to be created with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly appoint independent judges for a new Investment Tribunal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time , a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to appeal against judgments .
until now , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbitr@@ ators ; there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work on an International Investment Appe@@ al in accordance with its own information .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceeding ( IS@@ DS ) demanded primarily by large corporations is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parall@@ el@@ ism which allows companies to bid for damages to tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws , or establish a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organizations like Camp@@ liners described the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission included significant points in the reform that federal minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association business Europe warned against restric@@ ting the economic opportunities of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on the Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on the stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ dly acting fol@@ ks@@ crew recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of different places he records on the map again and again , what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ed and delic@@ ately arranged songs report .
where they originated and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be wonderfully creative .
with the third album Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; published in 2003 , clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can be dri@@ fted into great opul@@ ence at any time .
the rum@@ our , &quot; Mich@@ igan , &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 states states should follow in succession .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ se oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a nationwide celebrated masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
overl@@ apping ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then moves on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic parts .
this sixth regular studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
apart from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk music .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate in essence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first of all , St@@ ev@@ ens expresses his mo@@ dest@@ y , plays only a few older songs and finally deca@@ ys under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s Q &amp; A is expected to be eag@@ erly awaited
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire and for the first time set up with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six pre@@ determined issues shortly after mid@@ day , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several news articles in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of Shadow Ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are calling for differences in the economy , defense and foreign affairs , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within the Labour and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour amendments proposed to remove the whole idea of limiting altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and retired minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory leader over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who has promised a different policy phrase , says he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings are too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he is subjected to both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the strike with bar@@ gains and has instead made a focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of the economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought up the idea that other colleagues occasionally grab the word and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the Lower House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy @-@ Ju@@ dy Theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the prime minister was considered as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the under@@ house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds rose by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the Po@@ und rose jumping @-@ nicely to data , which showed an increase in the pay@@ roll growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and er@@ ased estimates of the time of an increase in interest .
the Po@@ und rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed by 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer of Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world , bringing together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bur@@ berry stocks were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose by 5 % , after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ by a share selling as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had sold his assessment of the rating to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company had posted a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers might mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the costs could meet J@@ D Sports &apos;s expansion plans , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

some say the hyp@@ e would go too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is finally right in the United States and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; ranked 1st .

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A @-@ poster Br@@ ings Lebanese on Pot@@ ato @-@ Greenland idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - and indeed in the potato @-@ dealer , that the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat have put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the shop has a barbecue , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has now been registered by the Lebanese at the Munich Patent Office .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
therefore , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
met@@ cash starts ground @-@ breaking campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ her@@ itance
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branches off an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia prior to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and selling shop owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will release further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day .
there is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA outlets and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in Eastern Australia .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that after opening his first markets , Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and € 250 million by the end of 2016 .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the loss in food and food business and the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around € 13 million before interest and taxes , &quot; said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover in the food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and to reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported that Met@@ cash was likely to disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , supplying about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction while printing on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , is resist@@ ing and investing more than 150 million dollars to compare sale prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week and to provide I@@ GA retailers with the improvement of their stores by fast growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging re@@ development programs to El@@ an will rise and hope that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit in four years in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ ien and deserves praise for his own behaviour , according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; became ra@@ mmed through the in@@ famous confrontation of Cy@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat him , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how to beat a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp worn a potential US Open title by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gra@@ oth for second place in the individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup Final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite event@@ ful about is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player to break a thu@@ g from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he has been treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is well in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday , and it describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the contest and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ ien &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick has made quick progress on what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency exit , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees
Hungary declares the emergency and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to enter the country illeg@@ ally , with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants in a No Man &apos;s land re@@ acted and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indignation .
the people who fled from violence stuck in a country strip at the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations went up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publi@@ ci@@ ze the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some denied food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be discussions with Brussels and other countries over the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ year bloc could not agree on a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the ab@@ rup@@ tly Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a verbal action from Brussels or from its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency situation rested on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ yar@@ to , said that his country was also planning to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it ended a fence along the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most emerging economies are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strong in opposition to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence , which allowed the government to build Serbia along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days on the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that authorities had reached 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are going to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounding the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to force themselves there .
about 20 managed to enter but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton remains a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the primary elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders ranked second , with 27 percent ( increase of 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet declared whether he is nomin@@ ating for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is what candidates should support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphics groups while S@@ anders earned some winn@@ ings .
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support in the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under the age of 50 has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
but Clinton has a big advantage with the older voters .
last month Clinton was with a double @-@ digit advance in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections say nationwide that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are above all excited by her .
the views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about one quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they are supporting Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president to be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the voting are also cited .
as the Vice President poses a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked the prim@@ aries who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be her second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage is higher than S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best odds of winning the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second to this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors emerged as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results with some important traits in the election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion about him .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
with questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term of office as foreign minister , most Democratic voters are happy with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was split in March , just after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion even though 36 percent said that their opinion was even worse .
they are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them to an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voters in the country regard Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tru@@ mp still receive good lead notes .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best in hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ ander rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 democratic voters in the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws near Donald Tru@@ mp in a country @-@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times Survey closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , half of the voters support the two candidates in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son well received demographic groups and sur@@ passed Tru@@ mp under republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , except C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio governor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell to the lowest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place at 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in the p@@ olls - he reaches 19 % support with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the recent pol@@ l of ABC News / Washington Post revealed Tru@@ mp clearly in front of Car@@ son .
with a look at the Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to asking Tru@@ mp faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on Saturday during a campaign presentation in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
in contrast , bathing temperatures still offer the Mediterranean : in the east it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College new@@ bies
almost two years after a student died during a sham@@ anic ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five persons were lod@@ ged .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police said .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to move across a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually compla@@ ined of head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g became impot@@ ent and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ o &apos;s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ ak@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members started to hide utensils and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in general by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ ak@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has repeatedly been attached to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with a bl@@ unter force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year in the ch@@ ic@@ anes , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the murder of the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous attacks and the formation of a criminal organization .
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold it to account , &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed raises interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a price increase is coming , and the sli@@ ps will fall into fuel , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
what we do not know is how long this will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the initial rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , albeit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are responding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the central bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants might find that all the excitement might have been exagger@@ ated because of an interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , advance withdrawal of interest rate things can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets yield 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what is happening after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases .
more specifically , the market has been in the past 35 years in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to price increase , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average yield in the past six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis that published Bob Dol@@ l , chief investment strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increases @-@ in cycle and the yield begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that have not existed before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate of interest in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interests since 1950 had only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 % , only a few expect this to continue and expect the third quarter to be expected by only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop may be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants spent the whole year on a rate increase in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essions are put into the shade very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the firm income was also volati@@ le as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in income , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares when they change their strategic direction .
in case of bonds , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase @-@ cycle , the loans fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate despite &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is interesting is that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alongside the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
in large and large companies that handle the larger portion of their business operations in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multination@@ als with high debt will be po@@ orer , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ Analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate figures in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital return as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares sur@@ passed their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are becoming a major problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how quickly it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Members of Parliament , Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of parliament critici@@ zed the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ bbing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament &apos;s colleague &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacked The Voice and said it was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading MP and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC &apos;s bos@@ ses that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also cited the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Director General dismissed the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to the public &apos;s live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , I think it &apos;s important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he needed to work harder to engage the audience when it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee on the choice of culture , media and sport , to tramp@@ le the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - featuring Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced in special BBC mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if it &apos;s the next time a series of entertainment star@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the pay @-@ pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down expenses in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s major shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure on August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now it comm@@ utes , and we may experience that the growth will dimin@@ ish .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the declining turnover .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers focused on their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers strug@@ gled for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a British Retail Con@@ sortium &apos;s study found that £ 5 spent a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during crane accidents - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia is partially responsible for the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane over@@ threw
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mosque .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead began their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed over to the holy site , where only days before a building crane had fallen through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the worshi@@ pers .
the corp@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi King imposed a san@@ ction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 worshi@@ ppers who were killed when a crane over@@ threw the Great Central Sea of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ ling will continue to Mek@@ ka with thousands who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree that was published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company was banned abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which collap@@ sed into a courtyard of the big mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the h@@ add@@ ling that took place later this month .
the Bin Laden group has not issued any statements about the breakdown of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also critici@@ zed the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s mo@@ z@@ ee as part of the massive building project headed by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia ruling family for decades and is undertaking major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased head of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apo@@ state son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the fall of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people were hospit@@ alized .
government officials ordered 1 Million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injuries receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss states that the time of cheap Eastern European tra@@ des@@ people is over
British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has risen
this leads to 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people .
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q stores nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that Br@@ its are laying down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home
if you are skill@@ ful to deal with a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
because the British are increasingly employing arti@@ sans to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique De Lau@@ ry , new manager from King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a big increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices , is now obsol@@ ete .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which are geared towards professional tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions are taken by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weighed the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to post@@ p@@ one this more closely to a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in manag@@ erial positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is the only company that has just 50 percent of the team busy with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher announced a decline in the half @-@ year profit and the turnover after the Group deb@@ ated the costs of closing the shops .
due to the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian vol@@ ley runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and for@@ bi@@ dding .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he was acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the defend@@ ants used funds from the association accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , using which they were allowed to dispose of their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ ences .
this fact was the president of the White Spo@@ on@@ bill , Justice in Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the off@@ ence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset was incurred .
the sports function@@ aries would have calculated only expense allowance and the sports club for which they had been active between 1982 and 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities transferred around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . € 4@@ 4.000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were faced with the situation : do we carry on or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ cru@@ iser of the finance office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shed some money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , there must be no debts .
furthermore , with appropriate financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the expense allowance had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid out only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
thus also l@@ ump @-@ sum and non @-@ detailed deviations seemed to be explained by the former chairman of the proceedings .
the accounts and the spar@@ es administered the two defend@@ ants together , the second defend@@ ant said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for financial reinforcement , important is only debt free , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in the year 2011 against the one official investigations for office abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared .
this account was based on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time .
he then said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant was informed , justified the function@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why indem@@ n@@ ity , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he had not agreed with this formulation , because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he calculated only mil@@ eage and diets .
he was charged EUR 1,000 per month to the association , but the actual expenditure had been much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were unable to provide accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer maintained after an operational inspection , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also obtained o@@ dom@@ eter money .
all the exercises can be made in cash , and he has to go to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the Bank after Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard st@@ alls more 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts that have been running for three years , the computer can reduce additional jobs when spl@@ itting the company .
the sub@@ missions at the US computer terri@@ fying Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) are no end .
within the scope of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
this will save costs in the amount of US $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
on the stock exchange , the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard stock took 2.3 percent .
the company , which has become a major player in Pal@@ o Alto , California , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ appointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate clients according to its services continued to last to the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo .
in the third quarter of July the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just US $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
revenues declined in 15 of 16 quarters .
HP is responding to change in the industry with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted very late that customers are buying increasingly smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more businesses online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct participation of German soldiers to combat operations in Iraq would , however , overwhel@@ m@@ ingly come up with rejection : 54 per cent spoke out against it , 35 percent were unanim@@ ous .
the fact that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria find 61 percent positive .
24 per cent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
a cooperation with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , rests 51 percent of the respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be for this .
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second day of the press at 6@@ 6th IAA

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed several hundred refugees at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water @-@ thro@@ wer .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line and behind the polic@@ emen there was a wat@@ cht@@ ower ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set up pe@@ pper@@ mint spray .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was dischar@@ ged from the zone .
children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out .
other refugees sl@@ umped together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries thanks to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world is watching when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were inter@@ ro@@ gated by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do so , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed acc@@ ru@@ ed NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a major central bank may leave the zero sector and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Managing Director of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ sty outlook on global circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warned the markets to adapt to an increase but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death Dan@@ ger at the Delta State University left ap@@ ologies
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleague later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; he could do it un@@ done , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but he will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distur@@ b no one &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when he surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He &apos;s not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville on that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. from the Delta State University , as his life lu@@ ke@@ over on the university &apos;s website .

Euro@@ logos : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organisation .
in 150 of the world &apos;s 1,000 managers around the world , the restructuring of the Group will cost the workplace .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa building is expanding its corporate structure and boo@@ sts the low @-@ cost Euro wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was a contribution of around € 500 million a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be responsible for the passenger business in the future .
the Euro@@ wing low @-@ cost airline should be developed as stand@@ alone as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wing in the board team headed by chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new creation , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wing , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been very complex .
the airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of annual sales of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the pilot agreement cockpit ( VI@@ C ) , the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the strike in the court on Thursday .
that divided the union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of the talks is to be the retirement scheme for pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come to sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is behind the pilot supply of the pilot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that Lufthansa is shifting to the Group &apos;s own line of cheap Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , Luke Sha@@ w experienced a double f@@ uss of his right leg .
while this brought the left foreign def@@ enders to cry and to exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the board and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is hospit@@ alized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months and it will not play in the group stage .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno appeared to be happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al gu@@ essed that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an ellip@@ se and a red card were due .
it was a very bad assault with both legs .
a tweet on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery now begins , I come back more strongly . &quot;

when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg burst when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost mem@@ orized .
unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister chose The Lor@@ ax , which was released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a news on Super@@ Camp@@ s website , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the plot of the book , is instead giving a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the pretty short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if it were not yet worthy enough : the text presented by Cameron is sometimes read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . here &apos;s an un@@ named boy , as the local environment is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , trees , the dre@@ ad@@ ful Once @-@ ler , a ho@@ vering , sn@@ app@@ y creature that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral bure@@ au .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the ban from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
b@@ umping into Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batch setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size on a test level , is an option for the attack .
related News : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the England @-@ test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are aligned to results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this to - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the run of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss hon@@ ed his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get such good achievements , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test man gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first deployed Jonathan in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he &apos;s a drummer I highly appreciate .
he is an X @-@ Factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but of course this depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to suggest mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I didn &apos;t mind about it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s cri@@ cket of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques have perhaps not done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Justi@@ n Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop , before he appeared as Open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred races straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cabin as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot during this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the coaching staff .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights that we can benefit from .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the changing room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I don &apos;t have any problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team leaders do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that , as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy falls into a trap by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ postpon@@ ed ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was severely dis@@ bur@@ dened because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at said recently that some member states , as deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always be full of their own guilt , the United Kingdom itself , with spl@@ endor@@ sed concessions and disrup@@ tive amendments that they usually do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened in the exc@@ essively long endu@@ ms such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left one .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they are going to pull a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers possibly don &apos;t plan helpful notes , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain won &apos;t win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press one , as they did not have during the 1975 referendum held by Tony Benn@@ n , which supported our admission in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who has made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who was his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ hack@@ ers , and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ im@@ porting countries most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found out that if you &apos;re sitting in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never denied it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cap on my back on Monday in Westminster , told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me anymore - seems to be in danger to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it pleasantly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ Ten@@ dency and the wild followers of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy@@ sc@@ out fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ uties according to all reports on their Sunday evening on Monday evening .
whatever the stirring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ ee campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ ui@@ ties about EU membership - in accordance with their Benn@@ ett siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among lef@@ tist dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic con@@ ten@@ tions .
as with his ambig@@ ui@@ ties on Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious elec@@ tors - in order to make concessions to the British , if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical professional journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis , &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ ar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ s@@ wis@@ s Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the financing he was supposed to have received after reports by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered , but there are several well known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include an industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the session was attended by the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most of the products in most of the criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he Report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence until now that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have served as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J claims had already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what is proof and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die every year from a disease associated with smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by clari@@ fying current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ern@@ ary , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ erin and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ cont@@ ested time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and tran@@ smit@@ ters like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly presented by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson added to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Kommunik@@ ations @-@ Committee as part of its investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I consider medium or long @-@ term not for a good idea , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as broad support as possible for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ern@@ ary is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
I &apos;m trying to see how this public television is to be .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC is to blame for valu@@ ations &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts will again give the BBC &apos;s former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 suggest@@ ing that the BBC shows like East@@ ern@@ ers .
Johnson said that the rather public niche programs &quot; go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue if they go to their apparent mission to justify four billion pounds of radio , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think that you get a great value for $ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travel thi@@ an mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to educ@@ ate , train and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain &quot; this in the public broadcasting stations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on TV , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers enter alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound stimul@@ i .
scientists have cul@@ tured worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by out@@ bur@@ sts of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound stimul@@ i that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
pul@@ ses work through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
chocolate worms do not usually react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms in such a way that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with pul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics may have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ imp@@ eded tissue and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons suscep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

what we need now is a step forward by the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our front door .

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ reli@@ eved 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those that I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence halls ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to shake : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken sab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal year , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
allow people to be .
people often turn into beverages @-@ recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting places , but they are also the places where people dress up and their under@@ wear coinci@@ de .
referring to this : do not remember to start the Uni with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted people receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space bo@@ omer@@ ang culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is tired of convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos ank@@ le : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friend@@ ships close through baking .
since you start the university at the height of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have made you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are an an@@ ual b@@ aker .
poorly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a deterg@@ ent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the true sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it makes them a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more lou@@ der music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two more hours before she set her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same residence hall ?

row houses for refugees , single @-@ ro@@ unders , low @-@ duty servic@@ er
real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental terra@@ ced house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the single mother and the poor servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well @-@ built today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are forced to go to the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner needs to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay here for a great deal .
in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need sufficient living space over the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you put people in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say that it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
did the building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building legally I have correctly dra@@ gged my project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking place regulation always makes it particularly complicated .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still subject to who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is the place .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which definitely is not true .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the poor servant .
I &apos;ll show you how to build a cheap and good building today .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS if Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , tap &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation because they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by reducing the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install apps once the process is completed .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone might switch to half way and this could result in a breakdown of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; ( chess club Bad Kis@@ singen ) , founded three months ago , has added another member in its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen on the cure .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Service Cross 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation received by Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to include chess players who cannot afford membership fee .
youth work and talent hunting should also be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of its solidarity with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the village of Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ ín have joined forces under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations you can also take part in courses there .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , you get sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ing information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of health and nursing homes .
for years , we have been campaig@@ ning with our out@@ patient care service that often nursing staff are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many performances of the insurance companies are not seldom used because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the new manager Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the mayor &apos;s hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health and wellness .
to do this , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre particularly in demographic shifts .
this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the neighborhood bure@@ au also dedic@@ ates itself to the association with age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the agenda and these invite to a regular soci@@ able applause . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the neighborhood office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

men beating out on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on the road from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 year old Afghan , followed suit by the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the level of the b@@ ft service station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man and struck this with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ bone and strongly bleeding from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first dropped off his sacrifice .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and passed there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you no longer saw the vehicle , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male person .
with the help of a punch pitch , one was beaten on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue activity description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ici@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field breaks on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his way to his successor in the coming months .
after a conversion period Müller opened the practice on October 12 , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the ri@@ ms met years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll who are currently completing their training in the Ver@@ den hospital and who also want to go into practice in the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the Müll@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ici@@ ausen and laugh@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I simply called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with practice .
they will still live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the tw@@ o@@ fold father Frank Müller was also raised , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical sur@@ geri@@ es as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a Senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is engaged in voluntary work in the D@@ RK @-@ prepar@@ edness in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ sei@@ zur@@ es works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ alist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a house doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ bearing EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the mil@@ ler receives a total of 50@@ 000 Euros as part of a subsi@@ dy programme by the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ t@@ congregations @-@ mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , about 2000 patients come to practice in the field of field breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practical takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ici@@ ausen .
if no follow@@ er had found it , she would have gone too .
who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s talk , inci@@ dentally also looks especially in familiar faces : the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power take over from the ri@@ ms .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ eat re@@ members with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she already felt a little melanchol@@ y after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the dormit@@ ory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and loves to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to submit an asylum application can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people are in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - denied Slovenia
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia hopes to continue travelling in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances set up corri@@ dors for refugees .
in this way , however , the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ no@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister pointed out , Sloven@@ ian wants to make its limits for refugees but not abri@@ dged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to pass in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby maize fields .
since then , according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving at the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , including many women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also already in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with some 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would be diver@@ ted towards Croatia , the Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was people wise to propose certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was around 500 kilometers away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard Hungary did , so the police said to us that we are going to come here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany , Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could in fact lead to the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route from Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call for details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . since then , the EU partners have consistently maintained a good testimony concerning the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , some 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees are now going to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to soo@@ the Wednesday at a local appearance in Hor@@ gos . he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be about very high refugee rates at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distributing maps indicating alternative routes through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land there are still 20 years after the end of the Cro@@ at war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Help is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well for questions and discussions as the volunteer staff .
while some pedestri@@ ans spontaneously go to the chal@@ k and read the sentence about &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; stop the war , &quot; &quot; stop the war , &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer long , &quot; others stay short , read , say sentences like &quot; as far as I &apos;m not , &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only if I realize that eventually the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the Director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband supports the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce .
therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wanted to communicate on the tables openly , however , is understandable , after all , it was a very personal matter .
the subject of death and death is still adher@@ ed to tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped to open up to people .
an estim@@ ation that shares An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ andro .
the death and mour@@ ning companion belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce helped by calling honorary officials , she immediately reported and had been there during the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ bes belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and depend@@ ant in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ hr@@ uro is able to deal well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another source , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of health insur@@ ers and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning companions .
training courses for new employees are offered every two years .
the tablets described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
also there , other personal wishes can be recorded on post@@ cards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the Gi@@ ver @-@ Gi@@ ant lowered his earnings outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire around 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. told us to make a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year ending in May , 20 cent less than in previous forecast .
according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
despite the increases in price increases , the lower level of view is 4.@@ 9 percent on average and effective on January 4 and despite higher charges for body transport of heavy and large packages , which will be le@@ vi@@ ed from November .
the company said , however , that the result is expected to increase compared to the previous year due to lower costs , higher revenues and due to growth in online trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company considers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income when considering the weaker than anticipated economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for vacation jobs were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research &apos;s analysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts charged analysts forecast $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which resulted in sales in unit express delivery .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales of bo@@ d@@ board transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express Unit recorded higher earnings because of higher prices , while the result was lower due to higher labor costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares ten@@ dered by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they ended with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
on their most expected session in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an table to decide whether it is time to lift the Lei@@ tz@@ in for the first time for almost a decade .
there is a mur@@ al of the United States at an end of the decorated , two @-@ story seating hall .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the nation &apos;s economic interests above all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight for predic@@ ting it . it is announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives from close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data on the economy show that it is growing solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on global financial markets might frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - even if it is just a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are observing , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which will uns@@ ett@@ le itself the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate increase this week .
however , the financial markets expect F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mitig@@ ate the blow by promising that further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial Standard jumped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the proposition this week , said John Lon@@ sky , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would calm the financial markets because they would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ella said in spring and early summer that in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the set would be expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level which the F@@ ed considers full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world sent together at the end of last month after China had utilized its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Price declined by more than 16 % in May when investors feared that the slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would boost global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , while the Dow is now almost 10 % below the top of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation when one should increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere advice of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its monetary expansion , dis@@ b@@ anded del@@ u@@ sions around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ er , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest rates , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its own interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited appreci@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability at first place only during a serious crisis like the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Sav@@ ings Bank of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come near that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she fears a wage increase because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Life Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome , does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
also with her 74 l@@ ences she still likes to teach .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seekers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , the whole thing is different than at a proper school .
Rio Grande &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS is trying to enligh@@ ten women on how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet affects pregnant women in fact the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million euro @-@ expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited sports hall at Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds progres@@ ses step by step : in the latest municipal council meeting , the completed building application was unanim@@ ously approved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee had previously decided , among other things , an application to a statutory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the current development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ room@@ y first and roof @-@ top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation that should be prescribed for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary , because the development plan regarding the til@@ ting of the roof did not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Bern@@ ina municipal council usually rather restric@@ ts in the case of deliver@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gymn@@ asti@@ cs at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated .
subsidies are expected from school and amateur sports promotion .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will now be submitted to the Land@@ rats@@ amt ( Land@@ rats@@ amt ) .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is seen by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed Land@@ rä@@ tin Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and will meet next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg will continue to work .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the still existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has spark@@ ed the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who was supposed to take over , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership from October 1st and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this would be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on In@@ ner Station on gastro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer and his team will be expected to manage both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years .
until now , the administrative district has planned to do so for 2018 , when the current rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
Land@@ lord J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , came to meet rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the Qu@@ asi Mo@@ ving to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for over 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
in the past few decades , the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar @-@ Li@@ ons are called tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at Berg@@ ischen HC .
although the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce .
in the last season , the Bad@@ wers took a painful defeat at the Bh@@ d and got something good there .
hunting Dark@@ ness with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police had shared .
after a shot , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the crime police determined .
miss 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victim of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds who have been missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has been missing a victim of violence since Saturday .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , including public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday .
a 20 year old , also captured on Tuesday evening , is considered to be a suspect , and the fact that the investig@@ ators lead to the discovery site of the corp@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen had not come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
during the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially opened the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the corp@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , it was reported to the authorities that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the dead bodies were put in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought forward on Wednesday to the Haf@@ ner , the investig@@ ators put a dead stop to him .
conclusions about the close circumstances of the action are to bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing shortage
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable place to stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction faces a challenge .
the distribution disputes in the German housing market have long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built every year by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the Association Agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
thus there are 14@@ 0.000 apartments .
refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers during the first three months of their stay .
many then come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers are living in the last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising refugee rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study also sets out significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a deficit of housing that gets bigger from year to year .
currently some 77@@ 0.000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther compla@@ ins , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in large cities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained invol@@ un@@ tarily longer in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the noise on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has been declining for the first time .
in order to solve the problem , the &quot; Social housing construction &quot; alliance proposes a re@@ boot .
the aim is to revi@@ ve new incentives for social housing .
in this way , the tax on the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic income tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats is temporarily suspended .
furthermore , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary according to the Alliance .
the funding program for Refu@@ gee Coun@@ ties of the Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start on Monday evening , more than half of the available around 300 million euros had been rec@@ alled on Monday evening .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia establish Cor@@ ri@@ dor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary is practically no longer going through , since more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the sealing of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees moved to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported by the Croatian broad@@ caster RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , are also virtually eliminating proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
according to media reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and with taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees don &apos;t run on border f@@ ences .
the border strip covers other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine clearance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should now quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , after the closure of the border no more refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday the police had 3@@ 66 contacted people .
shortly before Tor@@ tage on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years of prison and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ onen &quot; and almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
there were 13 families with small children and two elderly persons among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stopped there .
but practically nobody has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
they collected garbage which had left tens of thousands of people at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
bar@@ rage screens were disman@@ tled and one of the recording managers in the Grenz@@ ort was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants remained in the country according to government figures .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot regularly .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy after the Bridge Festival on Sunday with the clearing , when suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
on Sunday , however , because of the influ@@ x of refugees from Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the bri@@ st@@ les together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
first of all , we have opened the un@@ hoped @-@ for guests at first , with snack and drinks .
we said the same , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was natural for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a pleasure for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train in W@@ els from an ICE train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in order to make it after the announcement that rail traffic was stopped after Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
the regional train was put off at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , on the day before a two @-@ leg@@ ged race spor@@ tive - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp right away in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has publicly and publicly tra@@ cked the attitude of the Hungarian government into the ha@@ ze circuit of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leading these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees too will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land of land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they have invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for vulnerable seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - maintaining peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof lod@@ gings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Konrad has his hands full to deal with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to impose quot@@ as for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first concentration centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless any more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the shelter of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great vor@@ ti@@ ces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad uses 85@@ ,000 districts in the he@@ ur@@ ry year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 properties need to be found over the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the Länder , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial captains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these would have assured him of creating a quot@@ a for the coming refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ate supports Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Asyl@@ um Co @-@ ordin@@ ator sets great expectations also in the ORF @-@ campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels which are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers must observe a certain amount of the hand towel holders or the size of the upper light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , he is more successful in accommodation , Con@@ rad establishes with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say in the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Con@@ rad and Ma@@ ier don &apos;t charge the Republic as they themselves explained .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
his own quest for lod@@ gings has not been successful yet .
Konrad would have wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , there is no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for refugees planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons concerned are currently unable to accommodate these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other sites are to be tested for their suitability .
according to critics , the chief of the city council exercises the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts have to make their contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a lengthy telephone conversation with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday has dra@@ fted further action on the issue of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is now the appropriate border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the time being , special trains with refugees in Germany won &apos;t be able to give any more .
the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again demanded more reinforced solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , Austria now also has control over its borders , is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the course of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased to young innovative companies from the Technology Division .
&quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later also acquire them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
€ 1.7 million was invested in the location by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , one third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria , and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ flu@@ er opened second business in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually Jutta B@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to hand over the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she now grew up in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the store in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I should open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who herself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been put in the cra@@ dle by her mother .
I love most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why such a woman gets into rap@@ tures when seeing a beautiful hand@@ bag , the specialist woman cannot answer with the last certainty .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag fits every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called len@@ ders .
some people associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for upright .
whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , touching journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls up the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öh@@ n@@ fresh@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the win@@ em@@ aker village at the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 inhabitants place are related to it via zig @-@ z@@ ags .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del shot a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed by their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter Art , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , which besides Tru@@ mp also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) too , so with the statement that he would be successful also if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already a bit a big mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - too high German : the don@@ or , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , Tru@@ mp is coming from the village of the don@@ or .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the real estate company was the corner@@ stone of the real estate business in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp because he once was cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican migrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter the illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tru@@ mp ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The gran@@ ny was a born tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gro@@ wer in retirement sees the Americans rather distant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension coun@@ t@@ ess Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something to the church organ during a visit , which was generally well ank@@ ed .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t confess the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who saw the Sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the USA had been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even without the President Tru@@ mp the grapes are ripe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for whom Tru@@ mp has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 Kin@@ o@@ ists , also in the USA awak@@ ens the interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ steiger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for the award of the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one @-@ fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son come to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there are no major shifts in the ratings for Today .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international TV programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five major cities , compared to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for mon@@ day ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last tu@@ esday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
in August today reported an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
in September , Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators up to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these mor@@ es more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently swe@@ at@@ y father , who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and beat The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 a.m. to 5 : 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , resulted in an average 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) jumped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators on Monday evening and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
average Hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot Se@@ at will eventually prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute which could not beat the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery to reveal ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly have known who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , who eventually lands at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was covered with greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally have issued an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed up to the final on Thursday
all three women have settled in ly@@ rical fashion why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons for why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If you don &apos;t , who should get W@@ oods last Rose ? , &quot; their answers could become a game per@@ plex@@ er who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both of them fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sar@@ ahs ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a pair .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit of the house last week made her clear that Wood was &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally set to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , then she was en@@ ig@@ matic .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams looking for their impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ vert at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running game following a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
meanwhile , Tom@@ sul@@ a publicly supported Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the match .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ ts@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his p@@ atz@@ t catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne sank after the f@@ um@@ ble cur@@ sing the playing field and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens once , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
overall , however , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the free voters demand the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn break in large Wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ ki@@ ger warned against a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools . &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ ki@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get gra@@ dations in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Free Elec@@ torate &apos;s state parliament conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian municipality .
in fact , quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lap the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ ki@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as was the case during the Yugosla@@ v wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ ki@@ ger also called for more staff for the administrative courts , which are responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ ki@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a nation @-@ wide uniform standard of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is shifting away , others are not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to be able to act decisi@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the regional policy in the metrop@@ olitan city should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing favourite remains on the agenda : the educational policy .
for the new school year , cult Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Medium @-@ level plus &quot; at 47 gymn@@ asi@@ ums in which an extension of the grammar intermediate level will be tested from three to four years - in the result it will take nine years to finish school .
but Ai@@ ki@@ er is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 needs to be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want to .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever you want .
fortress Wall Street helps D@@ ax to jump
the German stock market has closed with profits over long stretches of direction and nervous trade .
only in the afternoon was a firm start of the US exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .

the Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as the index of the Eurozone dropped by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
net trading posts in London and Paris also booked solid profits .
in the US , the Dow Jones Index recently noted about 1 percent in the plus value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock markets are expecting the markets to be replaced by interest in the US and even to the big decline in the stock exchanges this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has temporarily pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and also left deep traces on E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel &quot; German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros in provisions .
the Federal Government denied the figures named in the press .
the share of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon equi@@ ties grew by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax peak .
according to a retailer , a positive report from the U.S. investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive effect from the weekend .
accordingly , investors gave too little attention to the German chip manufacturer .
in this context , investments in promising waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the automotive market should be paid .
automotive values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year , as the AC@@ EA industry association announced for the launch of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the papers from the Daimler and BMW motor@@ ways increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen virtu@@ es increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market , the return on return of listed German securities papers fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the Re@@ x market index climbed by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Federal Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the course of the euro sank in the afternoon to 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .
at mid@@ day the European Central Bank set the reference rate to 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars .

4 People killed after polic@@ emen shooting rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd fighting against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used tear gas and then shot into the air before it res@@ or@@ ted to rubber floor .
twenty polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ let that is known to be able to kill them , but they are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ sen@@ i say that new provinces being formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there have also been protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ rif@@ les who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the law@@ makers voted this week about certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the land at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be re @-@ built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters .
a mixture of trade , trade and living is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den City aims to market an approximately 4000 square metre plot in close proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , trade and living .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city .
which investor is coming into question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts have yet been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property that is located on the Ring@@ straße / Corner Great Street , already a few months ago and the building on it can be torn off .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented public plans for the project for the first time .
many An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure park
for months , behind closed doors had been negotiated , gre@@ ets , debates and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement are located near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ press company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; system construction , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ den Council &apos;s urban development committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach commented on the system construction management on the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the council members and over 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
violent reactions among sea bu@@ d owners who came to the meeting caused the pictures and new details to the desired hotel structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and committee member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant block that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like a number of other project critics that traffic would increase tremend@@ ously by the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus loads , so that this should be reck@@ oned &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what happens on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we must have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ation campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( goo@@ g . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million to humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the Don@@ ate call on its blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled up to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has distributed more than 4 million people this year .
many were also fle@@ eing from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq , and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight diabe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether obes@@ e people with diabetes live longer after losing weight loss surgery longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery &apos;s new study .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted among people who are disease @-@ obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I above 30 are obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity @-@ surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach cancer - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I was among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % dis@@ b@@ anded the diabetes condition and at 28 % partially .
in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with the diabetes , the diabetes completely dissolved in only one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results of controls in blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol in general were better in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surgical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group , the authors found out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass @-@ surgery group had lost more weight compared to the host rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater dec@@ lines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of more serious men in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies between 27 and 30 with his BM@@ I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East could lie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders urged to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama has addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama pra@@ ising Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you must reflect on long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we need to think about how killing is less@@ ened in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and found out that the violent reaction of the US pulled down a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that his motives were good , but he used violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in the intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , who swallow much alcoholic wash disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 were reported to report the toxic@@ ity control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them will go to emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants visi@@ bly while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of the social media .
videos on YouTube show how te@@ ens disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers allegedly have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few pi@@ ps can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning especially in infants .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison Emergency Center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the channel Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p around whis@@ ky , but people let this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ hai@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought to an emergency call for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold covered by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency medical doctor who treated them at the G@@ inn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ hai@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ hai@@ y@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands @-@ on disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario following the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ m@@ ological &quot; teacher by laying down anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to anti @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants and banned them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the vain plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross @-@ p@@ liers towards the industrial area and realized too late that two previous vehicles had stopped at the roundabout .
as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta .
the accident involving injury caused damages of some 10 000 euros , the police det@@ on@@ ated .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready and had to be tow@@ ed .
od@@ ors : no di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays the talk of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , Dei@@ la says that the ho@@ ops stand on a bad place , but that he will turn this again .
Hear@@ ts will fight S@@ FA for the accus@@ ation of N@@ eil@@ son and be cau@@ tious with January @-@ new commitments that could destroy the unit of the squ@@ ad
D@@ ons raise the lead on Celtic on five points
Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ ra@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected spontaneously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates were not under increased control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football dri@@ es Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
the former ran@@ ger mid @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and this is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm Games , and it &apos;s not just people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic fighting has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man out of Aber@@ deen , now with five points lead clear at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel exactly this - but we must continue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we really need to really support Celtic because that makes the player better .
getting together now is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously during January transfer
despite his comments only a few weeks ago , pointing out that he made a few January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic @-@ Target Person@@ s Mich@@ u with reference point
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer @-@ period in conversation , indicated he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le for two years and did not manage the passage from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts dis@@ continued on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts took 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red card of the Defender was later abol@@ ished - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains with what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I did not comment on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swear to avoid ty@@ ab@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was rebu@@ ked after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts on Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Greater Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is safe to say that I do not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has faith in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things up - but it conf@@ esses that the decline in the field has to end .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; win &quot; Hamilton against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in desper@@ ation to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic on the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , which have won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it increases overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
the unemployment rate of Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was 5.5 percent , as the figures from the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year since Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unk@@ ards interfer@@ ed with the process
as security guards could not paci@@ fy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pe@@ pper@@ y spray the officials could take the stur@@ geons in custody .
a respir@@ ation alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,@@ 89 Pro@@ mil@@ le .
the adolescents were picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2.@@ 15 Pro@@ mil@@ le and initially remained in custody .
why I &apos;ll be witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Death chamber if Richard Glos@@ sy is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January over his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as often more applications are available as places , a more realistic lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will watch it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist so it will not be allowed me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have formulated better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against capital punishment .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter at the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ k would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale Po@@ lic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to det@@ ra@@ ct the police was un@@ successful when he found himself in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , only a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the bank . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale were sum@@ mon@@ ed on Tuesday to a house arrest event in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , they tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me &apos; , said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired natives to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ i for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ pi sample at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ gations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking I don &apos;t do it , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had raised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly put themselves in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to grasp me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reign@@ ing president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the opinion that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L act in a cow@@ ard@@ ly manner and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people out there think I &apos;m there .
maybe they have to take my license and drive me away , and I have no doubt that what I say can now be thought about it .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the coach &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to say that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack had been applied mud or clay on the horse debate , which fell against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my colleagues wrong@@ ly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was also so on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy sets back against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critici@@ zed the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites in the N@@ F@@ D .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster &apos;s coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett did a barely concealed remark on the Storm team after his team finished the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy advoc@@ ated the cr@@ ushing of his team and said they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; when tac@@ kling the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team makes him confident , because they were worried that they were worried to be defeated by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about w@@ rest@@ ling when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year we didn &apos;t change anything about our defensive system or the techniques . but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus and that has provided us with the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he is probably not accustomed to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it is funny how this time always appears at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said that he will take care of it .
but now he has a team that can play and that we view as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co versus cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are drums doing and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
when they mention us it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm @-@ Team released this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ b@@ ail for Drug Ad@@ diction
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long punishment due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ ogram of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released for a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ accused in the yacht port during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge of the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the prosecution , he lied to the police concerning his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Justice Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on security deposit , under the conditions that he gave his Australian and his Serbian passport , reported to the police daily and to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver had been seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks taking part had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to move to the left at the last moment , as the police said .
the driver &apos;s cab of the crash @-@ causing collision ri@@ pped completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone from girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophil@@ es to send images
a ped@@ ophil@@ er used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she fell asleep , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the bewil@@ dering messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed the computers found under the address and searched &quot; concerning &quot; web searches that used terms for searching for un@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then Ho@@ gg affir@@ med that he did it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophil@@ es on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer from him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he then wants to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and thus confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused took advantage of computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
on 25 January this year , Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded not guilty to the charges brought against un@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year and did not appear before the court appearance on 24 March this year .
defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; is found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the judgement until October in order to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was given a security deposit in this case but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings in other cases pending .
he was taken up before the date of judgment into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
bad user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the big control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many Schle@@ user caused fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn in Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
you have come to the German side by foot via bridges and st@@ ow@@ age .
there they will be welcomed by the Federal Police and forwarded to the registration .
more refugees arrived at Munich &apos;s main train station on Wednesday , compared to the week &apos;s start on Wednesday .
around 700 people arrived in the capital city alone until 8 : 00 p.m. , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached 17@@ 59 refugees on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : runner of tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected in the southwest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm o@@ aks in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air is currently circul@@ ating in the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) announced in Stuttgart .
the powerful low is the footh@@ ills of the tropical tree &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic during the last days of the Bermuda Islands .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are especially expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , there is still to be expected in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ seek@@ er with bu@@ cks from 60 to 90 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometres .
on Friday we can see the sun again for a longer time .
the mass makes it : every two years , the autom@@ akers show their innovations at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , there is a significant improvement in the compact cars , which are currently especially well @-@ selling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , cars from the compact class are particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( September 17 to 27 ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year .
Rüssel@@ sheim . one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand by dealers in the fall .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the brand &apos;s core .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is also not to be much more expensive .
Rüssel@@ sheim . Opel is the first to enter the world &apos;s largest competitor , VW Golf , which starts at 17@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are for the first time .
in contrast to the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IAA .
and what will be added to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault will send the fourth generation of its Astra competitor to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen only as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an under@@ lined sporty GT version .
in trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan trigger is trying to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions at 170 New@@ ton@@ meters ( Nm ) .
the sales launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe will be in spring 2016 .
Ds 4th : not quite new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger put their first hand on the front panel : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , above all the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time in Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the ri@@ pped Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Pen@@ al Pen@@ al Pen@@ al Pen@@ al Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners generally claim financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected may even hope for money if they were confined to narrow spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was housed in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison facility between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally absent .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on the open foot@@ ing , was transferred to a larger cell .
his arrest warrant for the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
but the judges took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and returned the case to the re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity injured .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention were decisive for compensation , a compensation claim was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear the privacy of the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court must now clarify the amount of damage compensation .
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
in April they said a prisoner of compensation only in April because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
according to a decision of 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to an in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was accommodated in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case for three months , between 15 and 21 hours a day .
in recent weeks , the pris@@ ons in Berlin had come to the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore included again and again 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even in fights , it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young talent , 19 are to be cancelled in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to a different pre@@ diction Bet@@ ween 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is currently being built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space , however , is dramatic above all with affordable rent objects : every year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply to refugees .
for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments per ann@@ um would have to be built and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
scientists and Federal Minister for Building Construction also agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
according to Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation , the refugees in Germany are not systematically asking for their qualifications to help them get started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find employment in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of migrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , there has been a political turn@@ around according to Mr Thr@@ ash : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation to limit the asylum seekers to a residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , too , the point of view has prevailed - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking German knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and extra @-@ occupational language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the building of networks is the main road to integration in the view of Thr@@ es@@ enh@@ y .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ zi@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators is increased by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students with no knowledge of the German language are prepared in the classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case says from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal land does not prohi@@ bit asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , the internal sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his position .
student willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
because refugees with a res@@ titu@@ tion or cancellation do not receive any services according to the asylum application law more if they start studying .
in principle , the latter do not receive a bill , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to violence .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
however , this gap must also be closed , Mr Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively sweep the same rights to Islam as the churches have , and to further develop the existing state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ state church law into a new state religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic well @-@ being association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take preced@@ ence over religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the central council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to re@@ strain such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , the exploitation of discrimination and racism is more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination policy and a general equality law since a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders show , which systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same opportunities for all : what migrant organizations and stakeholders of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and what international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention should commit to Germany must become reality in the next few years if the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens should use its opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , Germany is in a position to provide medi@@ cally to the refugees expected so far , says doctor @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needed to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks to susp@@ end all deriv@@ atives in the registration of health cards .
services rendered could later be rec@@ las@@ si@@ fied with the Länder .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to pick up so many people with the limited power catalogue , which the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors mainly do the language barriers .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over , she calls for .
many refugees have also been helped with more general health care centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among refugee children there is a clearly more un@@ treated disability , and the young people are about HIV education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the partially other disease pictures German doctors come from their training but realize that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ est@@ ation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the don@@ or is possibly even relief in sight due to the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians have developed a highly developed education system , a number of refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill after estimates of the Federal psycho@@ therapy chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder are suffering from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment would be necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social institutions , in most cases , experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production , the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sings and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst in Man@@ ege invites you to dream on a brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - this is the motto of the current Man@@ e@@ gen@@ staging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the Circus is held in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for lovers lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus program convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies the Cuban duo wants to take it loose .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
their humor@@ ous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ v@@ ages , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with t@@ act and arti@@ fici@@ ality .
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
sli@@ mming people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with her ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are too often a topic for various animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if it doesn &apos;t work well for our animals , it doesn &apos;t work well for us . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every stroke unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read from the eyes every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena .
so the first commandment : care for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or one 200 people , we always do our best and are with all our heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks at his ideas from 17 to 20 September every day from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5 pm the prices are dis@@ counted .
in addition , the open daily Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , dropped the stairs from a podium in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media .
the opening of parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
in the past month , they had bor@@ rowed him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech that he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of the Parliament that immunity will end in parliament , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief spokes@@ man said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will be split into two publicly tra@@ ded companies this year and will separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing corporate hardware and service business activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP announced in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Me@@ g Whit@@ man , Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930 &apos;s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Kapitän Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says team@@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was not until September and as long as his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ ist scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the European Championship will certainly remain uncertain in the next summer .
the big shame on this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing back in the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als in 15@@ 7 league players in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most of the injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement will last in the injury rate during the last season .
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and gain fighting power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger is a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and treat the players who need it to break a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to go forward by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured by the judge scale 3.@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains driven from the far @-@ away hope to lead the association to its first European vocation triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked at arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , has now become more desperate than ever before , as self @-@ mur@@ ders among young men on a 15 @-@ year high level prove .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of questioning the culture that men are preventing to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominant .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the Beau@@ tiful with Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which spark@@ led through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football coaching in cosy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the phone pastor , I explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one talks about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest at this weekend with the completely new designed scenery , why don &apos;t you take your friends for a drink at Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone around alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game reports and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ pla@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally got their lead when Cav@@ ani got a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only strive for the qualification for the kno@@ ck @-@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was not a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c . he was later changed in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents to cause problems and look back , even if there are certain things that we still need to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not score one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could last a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Mary in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ eller was called the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he ended up in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ ti &apos;s pass behind the Malm@@ ö @-@ defense before he passed to Johan Wil@@ and beautifully into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who defeated Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but except for a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fosten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes got up , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which was not less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had started it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he showed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus achieved his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can come back to the game , and only an excellent pick from Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result low before substitute player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized a goal at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification rounds are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which resi@@ des in Switzerland , is affected by the collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected € 2.5 billion through a share sale on Wednesday as part of its huge debt plan .
the Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , stated in an explanation that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds to pay its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling raw materials prices since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of reference rights brought a rapid increase to the top of London &apos;s stock exchange trading on Wednesday morning .
the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core announced last week the 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around one @-@ third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have declined by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .
refugees arrive in Weimar

white House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , the first official in Washington , will take place on September 25th and re@@ plying to President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing in November , said the statement .
the US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be host of Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a Sta@@ ats @-@ D@@ iner after the two leaders have led bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President xis visits will offer the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but also to give President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to approach areas of dis@@ agreements in a constructive way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was first announced in February , will probably meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi will address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ es@@ pion@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 switch to FC Bayern
world champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago before the engagement of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times tro@@ phy champion , four times champion league winner , twice Club World Champion , twice European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi advises now that he was already before the Euro 2008 before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t have anything , &quot; he says .
and the registered office of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann bought the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns play time 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi was standing for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , switched off the Red ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s grand triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted as he stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black prot@@ agonist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ t un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments by the actor of The Marti@@ an intensified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invite people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown first said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a fil@@ ly beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People champi@@ oned the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on answered that her directing &quot; at the end could give us something we do not want . &quot;
after the discussion was aired , the social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval by Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et deserved more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its publication .
women &apos;s comments arrive at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement generated national impact and forced leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to cur@@ b anti @-@ discrimination practices .
in February , the singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already made the Pope , is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport climbing and assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten managed to reach the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard won victory , still under shock about winning the Big Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than 10,000 $ or had a life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , he receives the great grat@@ u@@ it@@ ousness .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any res@@ ent@@ ment over it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had exchanged roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for the eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
the T@@ wins spent a chance to climb within a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintains his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at the bull@@ pen any game , and therefore I want to go into the game quite concentrated .
the designated tiger hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first triple hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle &apos;s Navy on 6 July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the fight well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the Bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back meeting at the end of the seventh inside , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left h@@ ander Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy handed over the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who vent@@ ured a two @-@ run on the right @-@ handed rotation of Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run , Ver@@ hagen awarded the third Ba@@ z@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a Double Play
after he added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth in@@ ward , Detroit created an R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed sty@@ led S@@ ano on three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit prof@@ ited to the start of the game by a non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ h@@ ander veter@@ an , who had been stri@@ cken before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month due to a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches da in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game which made a single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up the middle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runner in the scor@@ ing position .
the third bass player Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not strike very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a breach of the Wur@@ f@@ schul@@ ter .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is deleted from the vulner@@ ability list to launch against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) is playing against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be signed in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it will then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , just as the city of Wiesbaden stated on Tuesday evening .
she estimated 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital were prepared in recent days for this case .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily perish .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
over the past ten days , according to the president of the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium , responsible for the initial up@@ take , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he proposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective destiny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the spot for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , on Tuesday evening declared the Austrian TV station ORF , to Hungary nobody will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send back refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an agreement on which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concrete figures did not call it and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start for a binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees in a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Federal Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin .

but if you don &apos;t have a place to stay in Germany , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this opinion was strongly divided in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or emphasized that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border with Serbia in the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania was set up with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling over Romania to protect themselves , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ yar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had gone through the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness accounts in Turkey , thousands of other migrants were on the way to the Greek border .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this de@@ fle@@ ction movement is only small , but nevertheless too big for a permanently fixed cel@@ estial body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State State ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technical sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Munich lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to be four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we need to think about it now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ reimbur@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential commitment of a uni@@ form@@ less professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slim line will often get dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly sm@@ elling .
the color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so even green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .

first blow @-@ rush , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ öhn wind through , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland ha@@ sten@@ ed on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and during the night on Thursday the F@@ öhn wind blows partly through the fo@@ eh@@ ind valleys .
after gro@@ oming on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area on the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the side of the Alps the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys on the night of Wednesday .
as a result , the F@@ öhn winds until Thursday morning in the valleys with bu@@ cks of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can penetrate to the neighbouring Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture begins to st@@ ow at the Alpine slope .
here ra@@ ins start , which lasts until Thursday night .
in total , in the south of the Alps , over the next 48 hours , some 100 litres of rain per square meter have to be calculated , this after huge amounts of rainf@@ all have already fallen over the last few days .
on Thursday morning the blow dri@@ es out , as a result a cold front rolls with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind picks up strongly to stor@@ my , and the temperatures are clearly back .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend , it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the work community of the Luther@@ an churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often only live in seclu@@ sion for centuries as a minority .
with the pla@@ za , symbo@@ lically it becomes apparent that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
at that time he perceived the city as a deca@@ ying sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions should have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome .
with his theses against the outlet , Luther had initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) mand@@ rel crown is one of the major works by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not by the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the painting for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated in 150 motifs his very personal interpretation of Bibli@@ cal stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is not syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite ble@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subj@@ ectively artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles which dev@@ ote themselves to themes such as cross paths , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ land .
with this he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther publishing house with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with a focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original biblical quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts to the respective situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family which belonged to the strict Protestant ruling elite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing has already happened with the cane &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work out to bring me back with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to restore the art of art in the quick@@ est way : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is today marked by advertising , and it is loud .
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like to let the viewers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; einf@@ all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look into the pictures , discover them and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not pay attention to completely compreh@@ ending the Bible , but also selecting the most important and mysterious subjects for him .
&quot; this was not collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther publishing house , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X
plans made , space found , company mand@@ ated to model earth @-@ hills for a circular course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finally finished .
failures in politics and administration ensured that it was dr@@ unken , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railways .
so hill deported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will go down in October , the first community @-@ mate Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another mem@@ ento &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga sets out a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football re@@ acts to the deterior@@ ating situation in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy its help in addressing the problems that arise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest every individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Ms O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the crucial course must be policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the si@@ delines of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
already this weekend the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they will carry the print &quot; Wir helfen - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen rider Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is about everyone , nobody can look away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use the federal state , no , we have to use our beam power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championships against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large collective work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government , provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost his left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the case of the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a glass jar after midnight that he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , impot@@ ent , then dra@@ gged out of the street - he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can pass such a thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to stand up again when you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ C without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : herd of wil@@ lows in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group play of the Europa League have finally broken .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load on its professionals , Tu@@ va will not only change its stem cells on the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the go@@ al@@ keeper &apos;s position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of gene@@ alogy Roman brush .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europe @-@ League matches , he left the door open .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ ging statement by Mit@@ tier R@@ eus that the final move for the BV@@ B in the European League should be the goal is to comprehend Julian Wei@@ gl : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be technological pioneer in changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic , &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the ministry of transport highlights , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a fast rise in digital radio communications .
in order to test new technology , a test track is currently underway on the free@@ way 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will not be br@@ ushed up additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to employ around the world to raise the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to advocate a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically feasible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , cars on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are to be expected not until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value added in driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around EUR 8.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied .
however , the German auto @-@ driving cars still look scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA Institute on behalf of the survey organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents estimate up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the US .
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the free@@ way , this could mean 15 percent in flowing traffic , 45 percent in traffic jam .
well each fourth would leave the car under no circumstances control .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ groom Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsorship program in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said single @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the list of yachts in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then Timo was also missing and we became Europe champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Water List Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible !
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who became the big star of the fashion scene , among others , with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially rejected attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ zer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly overlooked oeu@@ vre of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which a lot of effort has been carried out : to fr@@ inge the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was specifically engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have scrat@@ ched 14 tons of material in Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather trousers @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l &apos;s old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion design of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he wore his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him .
he later taught the throwing of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole the fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought the then of course .
he didn &apos;t have to pay the models for his first own fashion show .
they got nothing but could keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as a fashion niche
earlier we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabric and lace were created in a large quantity for customers , who processed them for example to blankets and curtains .
this is no longer working , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ vies .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze mode , fashion plays a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past stal@@ em@@ ates , is an increasing order potential .
those who don &apos;t use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of the turnover has been broken away .
there is almost no more private specialised shops and wholesale trade .
our products rarely reach customers in this way .
nowadays , the bulk goods are manufactured much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US .
enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness such as C@@ ord@@ ula farmer from the embroi@@ dery mill in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have been introducing a quality seal which shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger Zentral@@ enst@@ elle der West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that must first of all think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design often only varies slightly to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter resh@@ ap@@ ed the historic snow@@ ball tip .
at some places , the machine is sti@@ cking small spheres .
the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith master@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from them : &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and the surrounding area and would like to have a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ d peak .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends are not supposed to touch , but Disney dar@@ es to find a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; is not a new movie but a sequ@@ el that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magic n@@ anny .
it &apos;s about the experiences of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the Great Depression in England .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wide for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wide out@@ wards to foster growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was t@@ asked with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management board has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
according to the statement , a negative list is drawn up that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system will be tested gradually and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it shows the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guaranteeing a legal business environment and making the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also l@@ ure controls on the powers transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how they manage their businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy vis @-@ à @-@ vis foreign investments and will protect the legal interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law of the lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also attended Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double its mercury @-@ limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and allow consumers to expect a significantly higher dose of the toxins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has received such a work paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects missed in industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily poll@@ uted with mercury , that approximately 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the current limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller fish @-@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low poll@@ uted that they already comply with the planned maximum values today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal , highly toxic to humans , which is heavily enriched in predat@@ ory fish across the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system particularly in case of un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion to the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations reported more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish around the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide exceeded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted in March from paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most common reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
