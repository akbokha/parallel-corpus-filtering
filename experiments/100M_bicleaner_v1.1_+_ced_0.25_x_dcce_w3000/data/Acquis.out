the tooth@@ brush association is liable for the persons who owe the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned sums , as a general schul@@ d@@ ner@@ isch for the direction of these amounts .
( 2 ) If the laws and other provisions of a contracting party are not present in the cases referred to in paragraph 1 , the guarant@@ y has to undertake , under the same conditions , to pay a payment in the amount of the input or initial charges , to compens@@ atory interest rates .

however , within the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned period of two years the matter has been made to the object of a judicial procedure , so the demand for payment must be issued within a year after the date the judicial decision has been concl@@ usive .
( 3 ) The Om@@ bud@@ sman has the requested amounts to be paid within three months after the date of payment .
the cent@@ ered amounts are rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sed to the guarant@@ e@@ eing association if the customs authorities have been sufficiently demonstrated within two years after the date of payment of the payment , that an in@@ contro@@ vers@@ y was not committed in the case of transport .

( 1 ) For the temporary import of road vehicles , trucks or containers , which are used for the transport of goods in the TI@@ R procedure , no special customs document is required .
( 2 ) Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 does not prevent a contracting party to demand that the destination , which is intended for domestic law , to ensure that after completion of TI@@ R @-@ transport the road vehicle , the lor@@ ry or container is re@@ produced .
road vehicles or load recei@@ pts , which carry out a TI@@ R transport , must wear the right front and rear a rectangular table with the inscription &quot; TI@@ R . &quot;

if customs closures are viol@@ ated or damaged in other cases referred to in articles 24 and 35 , or if goods are destroyed or damaged without any violation of customs closures , the protocol contained in Anne@@ x 1 will be accepted for the use of the Car@@ net TI@@ R and the protocol contained in the Car@@ net TI@@ R ; the domestic legislation remains un@@ affected .

B ) To guarantee optimal cost effectiveness , for example , the following procedures are applied : I ) spatial f@@ ing@@ ling as a means of determining the material balance zones for accounting purposes ;
III ) Focus on the stages of the fuel cycle , which may affect the production , processing , use and storage of core material from which without further nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons could be produced , and the greatest limitation of verification procedures for special core material , provided that this does not hin@@ der the implementation of this Convention .
a ) To effectively implement the securing measures pursuant to this Convention , the Community of the Organization issued information on core material , the securing measures , and the characteristics of the systems which are for the implementation of the securing measures in regard to this material of Bel@@ u .
B ) The organisation requires only the minimum amount of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks according to the Convention .
II ) Information about plants will be limited to the minimum level required for the use of security measures in regard to core material , which is subject to the securing measures according to this Convention .
C ) At the request of the community , the organization is prepared to examine investment data , which the community considers to be particularly vulnerable to check in the premises of the Community .
these data do not need to be materi@@ ally transferred to the organization unless they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community without further access .
a ) i ) The organisation brings the consent of the community and the states to the designation of inspec@@ tors for the states .
II ) In@@ cre@@ ase the commun@@ ion either against a proposed designation or at any time against a given designation , the organisation of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative den@@ om@@ inations .
( III ) If due to the repeated ref@@ usal of the community to appro@@ ve the appointment of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which are hin@@ dered by this agreement , the Council shall discuss the ref@@ usal after it has addressed the general director of the organization - in the following as &quot; the general director , &quot; with the aim of meeting the appropriate measure .
B ) The Community and the States Parties shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization can actually perform the tasks assigned to them after their agreement .
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and disturb@@ ance for the community and the states and for which the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection are as low as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the organisation for knowledge of applicable confidential information is ensured .
each State applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks according to this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and deliver@@ ances of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization .
the securing measures after this agreement are termin@@ ated with regard to core material when the community and the organization see that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable or practically non @-@ usable for a nuclear activity which is under the point of view of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang .
the Community noti@@ fies the organization according to the provisions of this Convention , the transfer of nuclear material from the states that are subject to the security measures under the Convention .
the security measures under this Convention are termin@@ ated in relation to the core material as soon as the recipient state , as fores@@ een in this Convention , has assumed responsibility for it .
the organisation carries out documents from which any disclosure and , if necessary , arise the re @-@ use of the securing measures on the distributed core material .
should core material , the securing measures under this Convention shall be used , in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the Community agre@@ es with the organization of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures can be termin@@ ated in relation to this material .
II ) that during the period of non @-@ application of the security measures , the material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons .
B ) The organization and the Community shall ensure that the hed@@ ging measures provided in this Convention shall not be applied as long as the core material is used in such activity .
as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under what circumstances these securing measures will not be applied .
in any case , the securing measures en@@ vis@@ aged in this Convention will again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity .
the organization is held on the ongoing basis over the total quantity and composition of this material in the state or the states concerned and on any transfer of such material from this state or these states .
this explains their understanding as quickly as possible ; it only covers issues such as time and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a secret knowledge of military activity , and does not apply to the use of the core material .
the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in carrying out their respective obligations under the Convention .
if the community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereignty , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special search of the organization , the organisation ref@@ uses to rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se the costs , provided that it has been prepared in advance .
in any case , the organisation carries the costs of all additional measurements and sampling , which are demanded by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and the States ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be taken to the Organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as on the nation@@ als of the states .
any claim to which the community or a state vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization against the community or a state due to damage - with the exception of damages arising from a nuclear incident - is governed by the implementation of the security measures pursuant to this Convention , is governed in accordance with international law .
after veri@@ fying the objective information submitted by the General Director , the Council is unable to verify that no core material , which has to be subject to hed@@ ging , has been diver@@ ted for nuclear weapons or other nuclear parts , so he can rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se the reports provided in Article XII ( C ) and if necessary also the other measures provided there .
in the case of such steps , the Council , in which mass was gained by the measures applied to the securing measures , takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties is concerned - any justi@@ fiable opportunity for the Council to provide the necessary security .
on request of the organization , the community or a state , consult@@ ations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of the Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes , an establishment of the Council after article 19 or one of the Council adopted by the Council are disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement , and which are not included in the negoti@@ ation process or by another of the organization , the community and the states , on the request of a party to submit to an Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal , consisting of five arbit@@ rators .
the community and the states ap@@ point two refer@@ ees , the organization also names two refer@@ ees , and the four arbit@@ rators shall elect a fifth who leads the pres@@ idency .
if the Community and the States or the organization within thirty days after the request for an arbit@@ ration have not been appointed two arbit@@ rators , the Community or the Organisation may seek to ap@@ point the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbit@@ rators .
the same procedure is to apply if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent and all resolutions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators .
the decisions of the arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal shall be binding for the organisation , the community and the States concerned .
a ) The Convention comes for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and members of the Community are noti@@ fied in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention .
II ) if the Community of the Organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of the Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the Parties about a change in the Convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states .
C ) The General Director teaches all Member States of the organization immediately of any amend@@ ment of the Convention .
a ) The Convention enters into force on the day that the organization of the Community and the States receives written notification that their procedures for the entry into force are completed .
B ) The agreement remains in force as long as the states are contracting parties of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term used in this agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures involved in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures as necessary .
the aim of the safegu@@ arding measures defined in this Convention is the timely discovery of the diver@@ gence of significant amounts of nuclear weapons from peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes , as well as the det@@ err@@ ence of such an off@@ ence by the risk of premature discovery .
to en@@ rich the target defined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , composite with spatial integration and observation as important supple@@ mentary measures .
the technical completion of the inspec@@ tions by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity not proven for each material balance sheet is specified for a specified period of time , indicating the limits of accuracy for the given directions .
in carrying out their veri@@ fications , the organisation is making full use of the security system of the community in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of its securing measures , the Community of de Proc@@ ed@@ ure and measures of the following kind will make use of it and , as far as necessary , proceed as far as it is determined and appropriate in the supple@@ mentary agreements :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , contra@@ cted , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and stock ;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and ass@@ essing measurement uncertainty ;
( C ) Proc@@ ed@@ ure to determine , review and evaluate differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for ass@@ essing the accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which identifies the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) provisions that ensure that accounting practices and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proc@@ ed@@ ure to rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures under this agreement do not extend to material in mining or in the ore processing .
B ) ur@@ anium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ al material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , which is described under the letter c ) , divi@@ des the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced specifically for non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) its core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ open@@ enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the protection measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , the Community believes that the recovery of core material , the securing measures according to this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable from resi@@ du@@ es , so consult the organisation and the community on the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The securing measures en@@ vis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community clearly notice that this core material is practically non @-@ profit @-@ able .
at the request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the safegu@@ ards following this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams - or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material when used in non @-@ nuclear activities after article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which lies over 80 % .
at the request of the Community the organisation of core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures based on this Convention , fre@@ es from these securing measures , if the whole , due to this article in the countries fre@@ ed core material quantity at no time is more than
a ) a kil@@ ogram of special fol@@ dable material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ plying its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with forti@@ fication , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calculated by multi@@ plying its weight with the fifth square of the enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the core material is to be processed , processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the hed@@ ging measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions will be taken for the re @-@ use of the securing measures on that material .
the Community meets with the organisation supple@@ mentary agreements , which are necessary to determine the extent required for successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organization in accordance with this Convention , in detail how the procedures specified in the Convention are applicable .
the supple@@ mentary agreements may be extended or changed without alter@@ ing this agreement in the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supple@@ mentary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report named in Article 62 , the organisation provides a summar@@ ized inventory of the entire core material contained in the states , regardless of its origin , on and carries on this inventory list based on the following reports and the results of their veri@@ fications .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its member states Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other
( a ) The E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is imp@@ eded by common Res@@ sour@@ cent@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ Hits .
C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
d ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted one another about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the middle ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC has submitted a table which is evident in which way it intends to apply the criteria set in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the term &quot; Special Acc@@ ep@@ tance account , &quot; which consists of the funds , which the member states contribute to the special action account in accordance with this agreement ( in this capacity , the organization is referred to as &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special action account is se@@ per@@ ated separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able promis@@ sory notes of the member state to pay upon request in the currency of the relevant state to the Order of the Organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be depos@@ ited with the organization in the respective country .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first amoun@@ ting to at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or another between the E@@ EC and the administrator agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the rema@@ inder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different time agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State can make payments in front of the above @-@ mentioned dead@@ lines upon request .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about propor@@ tion@@ ate draws on the cash or the Notes to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and to compens@@ ate the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
when gran@@ ting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ e@@ eable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional credit absorption capacity for loan terms without discounts ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries are regulated by contributions from other sources .
every transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly pay@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , which is considered , approved , approved and managed for the loan program of the organization , according to the procedures and practices that are considered by the organization funded by the organization ( b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special action account must not be used instead of ord@@ inal means by the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization which has been approved as part of a loan or loan for a programme or project which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 Special Ac@@ counts are subject to the same payment terms , which are generally valid for the organization granted by the organization ; thus , they are rep@@ ay@@ able in ten years in each case in 50 years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are pay@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay for this watch are to be paid directly to the organisation which it ret@@ ains .
every transaction loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which , in particular , the origin of the means is given .
the revenue from any special transaction loan can be used for spending in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced bz@@ w . ii ) in developing countries that are members of the organization and who , according to the measure of what the car@@ et@@ aker has set at the time of loan granted , may be recipients of a special loan .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of a special transaction account are made to the special action account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be re@@ mitted to the member state as soon as possible by the administrator to the member state .
the car@@ et@@ aker will instru@@ ct the E@@ EC for the complete dispens@@ ing of all transactions on behalf of the directors in preparation and on the plans and programmes approved by the directors .
during the period of rep@@ ay@@ ment of the transactions loan , the car@@ et@@ aker instru@@ cts the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the transaction loan and the expendi@@ tures made for this .
the administrator transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after conclusion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account .
after full payment of the transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC transfers as soon as possible a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special action account .
the administrator creates and condu@@ cts appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special action account , which account from the accounts pay@@ able to the account , and the amounts paid out from the account and the withdrawal payments to the Member States are obvious .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the complete edition of the special action account from time to time will lead to an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects funded by special actions and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organisation possibly agree , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are invalid with immediate effect .
in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fy the Council of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Secretary General condu@@ cts these noti@@ fications together with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organisation .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organisation .
this agreement is written in two sig@@ natur@@ es in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch language , although each wording is binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of a change to the amend@@ ment of the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE RE@@ PLA@@ CE@@ MENT :

I permit me to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :

an agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States within the framework of the medium @-@ term financial subsi@@ dy
the BIS could conclude Stand@@ by credit agreement with the central banks of credi@@ tors when the banks submit an appropriate request .
the agreements could be concluded up to the total amount of the fee paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion b@@ illing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future member states &apos; future deplo@@ y@@ ments .
however , some conditions are already mentioned , to whose application the BI@@ Z would be prepared .
with each stand@@ by credit the BI@@ Z would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of prolong@@ ations , without having to be exceeded altogether five years .
at the opening of the loans , as well as with their previous renewal , BI@@ Z would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , the initial draw would not be made before the end of a month after conclusion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liqui@@ dity .
the proceeds will take place in the BI@@ Z at the disposal of the agreement at the disposal of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods intended to negotiate with the funds of the bank , presum@@ ably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those engaged in the BI@@ Z at the respective time on similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ Z has to obtain the required funds themselves on the market , then the interest rate will reach a maximum , corresponding to the Li@@ bor increased by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb
I appeal to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to define provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep - and goat meat by the community .
- fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - lamb - and go@@ at@@ meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
within the framework of this agreement , the export possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in slaughter body weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina under@@ takes to ensure that the actual quantity not exceeding the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the offer form is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this Agreement shall consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the Committee mentioned below , in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community accepts the protective cl@@ ause , it is obliged to ensure that the access to Argentina &apos;s access to the Community market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed the stipul@@ ated quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year .
the Community committed itself to con@@ fine the exhaus@@ tion on imports of the products collected by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st rate of 10 b.@@ o.@@ ad val@@ or@@ em .
at the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount of Argent@@ inian trade in accordance with the scope of Argent@@ inian trade with each new member state .
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be borne by the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ satz of the exhaus@@ tion under number 5 .
the total amount known under number 2 is set on the day of the accession of Greece to the community to 23,@@ 000 tons of slaughter body weight .
the community takes everything to avoid market developments that may affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the community meets precau@@ tions so that the sales of intervention stocks of frozen meat are not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation the sales of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agre@@ es that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat as well as for slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only take place at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms are interpreted in a way compatible with Article XVI of the GAT@@ T , and in particular article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the general customs and trade agreement .
Argentina , in particular , ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular by gran@@ ting the quantities of export licenses set out in the agreement for the products specified in this agreement .
the Community committed itself to meet all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent on the submission of an export license , which is issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine government .
the details of the application of this system are stipul@@ ated in such a way that the position of a security deposit will be wai@@ ved for the gran@@ ting of import license for the products in question .
in implementing provisions , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority shall also stipul@@ ate that the responsible position of the Community in regular intervals has noti@@ fied the amounts necessary for export licenses ; these details may be dec@@ ryp@@ ted according to destination country .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and functioning smoothly .
he regularly reviews the tendency on the h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat @-@ meat market of both parties and on the world market , as well as sales conditions on these markets , including conditions specified under number 7 .
the committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat under the agreement will not be carried out under the agreement .
the Committee shall discuss all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall be considered un@@ har@@ med by the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the GAT@@ T .
the annual amount of the year is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the quantity applicable by the entry into force of this agreement will be set to 1 January of the following year , in proportion to the total volume of the year and will take account of the seasonal character of trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; at this time , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties prior to 1 April 1984 with regard to changes they are deemed necessary for necessary .

in addition , the two parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of creative workers in the community without danger to market stability .
taking into account the goals and provisions of this agreement , the Community agre@@ es that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat as well as for slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only take place at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products .
new Zealand ensures compliance with the amounts mentioned in cl@@ ause 2 in particular , that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts .
the Community is committed to meeting all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products with origin in New Zealand is made dependent on the presentation of a export license , which is issued by the competent authority designated by the New Zealand government .
the details of the application of this system are stipul@@ ated in such a way that the position of a security deposit will be wai@@ ved for the gran@@ ting of import license for the products in question .
in implementing provisions , the competent New Zealand Authority of the competent authority of the community in regular intervals has noti@@ fied the amounts necessary for export licenses ; these details may be dec@@ ryp@@ ted according to destination country .

C ) which are not free of transmitted diseases by blood trans@@ f@@ usions , so far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history .
the blood flow takes place as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ de into a ster@@ ile bottle by a closed , ster@@ ile tube system , in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution was introduced before ster@@ il@@ isation .
after the blood removal is finished , the bottle is immediately closed and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it must be opened immediately before using the blood .
moder@@ ately , the anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution should not exceed 220 ml per litre of human whole blood , and the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration must not exceed 97 g per liter .
the blood type after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to be determined beforehand by the blood cells and ser@@ um ; the R@@ h factor is determined by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
in@@ sof@@ ar as it is standardized or recommended for blood group determination in individual countries , these apply .
the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific tests have yiel@@ ded the absence of anti@@ gens C , D , Du and E .

a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human whole blood , from which the most part of the plasma has been removed .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been won ; other blood cells components can be present or may have been partially removed .
the liquid content of the concentrate is either of the rest of the plasma or a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial water solution , which was added after plasma removal .
the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approxim@@ ate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit ) is indicated on the label .
all processes required for production must take place under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the assistance must be carried out using a ster@@ ile , closed system and exclusively by pressure .
if an artificial irrig@@ ation solution has been added , it is also possible to specify its volume and composition on the label .
the human dry plasma is extracted through dehy@@ dra@@ tion of the liquid , which is depos@@ ited at cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ ation or sedi@@ ment human whole blood above .
the human dry plasma is obtained by cold drying or any other method , by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins is avoided .
the dry product can easily be dissolved in a water quantity , which corresponds to the amount of fluid , from which one went out in the production of the substance .
the protein concentration of the solution won &apos;t be less than 45 g per litre , and the solution must not show any visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products .
donations in which ( using a fresh blood sample ) have been established a dangerous salary of I@@ so@@ h@@ äm@@ oly@@ sin or immune Hä@@ mag@@ glut@@ in@@ ine are excluded .
if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours of blood withdrawal , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood volume of at least 10 ml .
to turn off the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in plasma , blood donations are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood volume of at least 10 ml .
to reduce the risk of transfer of I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation h@@ epatitis , compounds are to be taken to contain compounds that do not contain more than 12 donations , or apply other methods that are known to reduce this risk in a comparable manner .
one of the liquid quantity from which one went out during the production of the plasma , corresponding water quantity must be added ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C .
a given quantum plasma is dissolved in the amount of water that corresponds to the amount of liquid produced from which it is produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests :
1 ml solution uses a sufficient amount of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de , so co@@ ag@@ ulation is done ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ furn@@ ace at 37 C .
due to the 24 @-@ hour drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des under a pressure of 0,@@ 02 mm mercury , weight loss over 0,5 % may not occur in human dry plasma .
human dry plasma is in a nitrogen ath@@ mosph@@ ere or in an air @-@ empty space in a ster@@ ile , sealed bottle under exclusion of any micro @-@ organisms and the possibility of any moisture to store ; it is protected against light and keep at a temperature below 20 ° C .
human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions of human plasma proteins are preparations from the protein component , which comprises about 60 % of the total protein of the plasma of the human whole blood .
regardless of whether the final product should be flu@@ x or dry , the preparation of a suitable stabili@@ zer in the final container must be heated up to 60 C ± 0.5 C in the final container for 10 hours to in@@ activate the agent of the I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation h@@ epatitis .
in preparations from human alb@@ um@@ in at least 95 % of the mass of the existing proteins have to be alb@@ um@@ in .
in both preparations no more than 10 mg of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin G may be present per gram of the product .
if the final product is fre@@ eze @-@ dried , it must contain at least 950 mg protein per gram of the product .
if the fraction is made of human plasma rot@@ ein as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 g per liter .
if human alb@@ um@@ ine is produced as a solution , there must be a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per liter .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the recommended way by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ äm@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated th@@ inning of the re@@ agent to the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um dil@@ lution , in which a reaction occurs ; th@@ inning is calculated solely of the volume of blood cells floo@@ ding in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , activity is expressed through time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are executed at the time of standards .
according to definition , an International Standard prepar@@ atory contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .

re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities , that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount must be so large in a container that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy test described in this protocol .
the manufacturing laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all given re@@ agents can be stored for so long from the laboratory until some lik@@ eli@@ hood may be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood @-@ group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective share in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin exclusively or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .

under NOTE , DAR@@ LING that its cultivation will depend on the existence and standard of living of millions of families , which in turn depend entirely on the measures required to maintain and extend the consumption of olive products in the producing countries themselves and in the non @-@ generating consumer countries ;
with regard to DAR@@ LING that olive oil and table oli@@ v@@ ae are essential ingredients in the areas in which olive cultivation is common ;
with regard to DAR@@ K that the essential feature of olive production is the in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies of harv@@ ests and the market supply , and that this leads to fluctu@@ ations in production , prices and export revenues as well as to very different producer revenues ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to DAR@@ LING that this causes all special difficulties which seriously harm the interests of producers and consumers and endanger@@ ing the general policy of economic growth in the countries that lie in zones where the olive cultivation is common ; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mention the extraordinary importance of olive production for the economy of many countries , especially the olive growing countries currently under development ;
