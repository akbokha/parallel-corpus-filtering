<seg id="645">A) In the implementation of hedging measures after this agreement, technological development is fully charged in the field of security measures, and all efforts are made to ensure the optimal cost effectiveness and application of effective securing monitoring of the flow of nuclear material, which is subject to this Convention, to ensure that the current or future technology allows this.</seg>
<seg id="646">B) To guarantee optimal cost effectiveness, for example, the following procedures are applied: I) spatial fingling as a means of determining the material balance zones for accounting purposes;</seg>
<seg id="647">III) Focus on the stages of the fuel cycle, which may affect the production, processing, use and storage of core material from which without further nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons could be produced, and the greatest limitation of verification procedures for special core material, provided that this does not hinder the implementation of this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="648">A) To effectively implement the securing measures pursuant to this Convention, the Community of the Organization issued information on core material, the securing measures, and the characteristics of the systems which are for the implementation of the securing measures in regard to this material of Belu.</seg>
<seg id="649">B) The organisation requires only the minimum amount of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks according to the Convention.</seg>

<seg id="658">II) the protection of industrial secrets and other inspectors of the organisation for knowledge of applicable confidential information is ensured.</seg>
<seg id="659">Each State applies to the organization, including its assets, funds and assets, as well as to their inspectors and other officials, the tasks according to this Convention, the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the prerogatives and deliverances of the International Atomic Energy Organization.</seg>
<seg id="660">The securing measures after this agreement are terminated with regard to core material when the community and the organization see that the material is consumed or diluted in a way that it is no longer usable or practically non-usable for a nuclear activity which is under the point of view of the securing measures of Belang.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Community notifies the organization according to the provisions of this Convention, the transfer of nuclear material from the states that are subject to the security measures under the Convention.</seg>

<seg id="669">The organization is held on the ongoing basis over the total quantity and composition of this material in the state or the states concerned and on any transfer of such material from this state or these states.</seg>
<seg id="670">This explains their understanding as quickly as possible; it only covers issues such as time and procedural provisions and agreements for reporting, but does not include a endorsement or a secret knowledge of military activity, and does not apply to the use of the core material.</seg>
<seg id="671">The organization, the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in carrying out their respective obligations under the Convention.</seg>

<seg id="696">The aim of the safeguarding measures defined in this Convention is the timely discovery of the divergence of significant amounts of nuclear weapons from peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosives for unknown purposes, as well as the deterrence of such an offence by the risk of premature discovery.</seg>
<seg id="697">To enrich the target defined in Article 28, material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance, composite with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical completion of the inspections by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity not proven for each material balance sheet is specified for a specified period of time, indicating the limits of accuracy for the given directions.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out their verifications, the organisation is making full use of the security system of the community in accordance with Article 3.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the Community for core material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In the application of its securing measures, the Community of de Procedure and measures of the following kind will make use of it and, as far as necessary, proceed as far as it is determined and appropriate in the supplementary agreements:</seg>

<seg id="710">B) uranium or thoriumal material, which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle, which is described under the letter c), divides the quantity and composition of the material, provided that it is not introduced specifically for non-nuclear purposes;</seg>
<seg id="711">C) its core material, which is suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or isotopenenrichment, the plant or the process phase in which it is produced, or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle, so it is subject to the protection measures mentioned in this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="712">A) The safeguards provided in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11. however, the Community believes that the recovery of core material, the securing measures according to this Convention, is temporarily not possible or desirable from residues, so consult the organisation and the community on the application of suitable securing measures.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The securing measures envisaged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13, provided that the organization and the community clearly notice that this core material is practically non-profit-able.</seg>
<seg id="714">At the request of the Community, the organisation frees the following core material from the safeguards following this agreement:</seg>
<seg id="715">A) special fissile material when used in grams - or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments;</seg>

<seg id="723">C) twenty metric tons depleted uranium with an accumulation of 0.005 (0.5%) or below;</seg>
<seg id="724">If the core material is to be processed, processed or stored together with core material, which is subject to the hedging measures under this Convention, precautions will be taken for the re-use of the securing measures on that material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The Community meets with the organisation supplementary agreements, which are necessary to determine the extent required for successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organization in accordance with this Convention, in detail how the procedures specified in the Convention are applicable.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplementary agreements may be extended or changed without altering this agreement in the agreement between the organization and the community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention. the organization, the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within ninety days after the entry into force of this Convention; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report named in Article 62, the organisation provides a summarized inventory of the entire core material contained in the states, regardless of its origin, on and carries on this inventory list based on the following reports and the results of their verifications.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its member states Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organization (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">(a) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help the immediate needs of individual countries with low incomes, whose development is impeded by common RessourcentransferHits.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the organization have consulted one another about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the middle ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organisation of the EEC has submitted a table which is evident in which way it intends to apply the criteria set in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the term "Special Acceptance account," which consists of the funds, which the member states contribute to the special action account in accordance with this agreement (in this capacity, the organization is referred to as "steward"), and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special action account is seperated separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or irreconcilable promissory notes of the member state to pay upon request in the currency of the relevant state to the Order of the Organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited with the organization in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment is made in two installments (i) the first amounting to at least 45 v. h. the fee within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different time agreed between the EEC and the caretaker, taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State can make payments in front of the above-mentioned deadlines upon request.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the caretaker takes about proportionate draws on the cash or the Notes to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and to compensate the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its additional credit absorption capacity for loan terms without discounts; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries are regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Every transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly payable development programme or project (including a sectoral project), which is considered, approved, approved and managed for the loan program of the organization, according to the procedures and practices that are considered by the organization funded by the organization (b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special action account must not be used instead of ordinal means by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization which has been approved as part of a loan or loan for a programme or project which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4 Special Accounts are subject to the same payment terms, which are generally valid for the organization granted by the organization; thus, they are repayable in ten years in each case in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are payable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts to pay for this watch are to be paid directly to the organisation which it retains.</seg>
<seg id="750">Every transaction loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which, in particular, the origin of the means is given.</seg>
<seg id="751">The revenue from any special transaction loan can be used for spending in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced bzw. ii) in developing countries that are members of the organization and who, according to the measure of what the caretaker has set at the time of loan granted, may be recipients of a special loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of a special transaction account are made to the special action account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be remitted to the member state as soon as possible by the administrator to the member state.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker will instruct the EEC for the complete dispensing of all transactions on behalf of the directors in preparation and on the plans and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of repayment of the transactions loan, the caretaker instructs the EEC quarterly on the development of the transaction loan and the expenditures made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after conclusion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement of the external auditor of the organization to this account.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC transfers as soon as possible a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special action account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and conducts appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special action account, which account from the accounts payable to the account, and the amounts paid out from the account and the withdrawal payments to the Member States are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker up to the complete edition of the special action account from time to time will lead to an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects funded by special actions and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date, which the EEC and the organisation possibly agree, the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are invalid with immediate effect.</seg>
