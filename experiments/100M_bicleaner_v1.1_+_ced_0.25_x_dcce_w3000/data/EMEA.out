this document is a summary of the European Public Review Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evalu@@ ates the studies carried out to make recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ y thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things which are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a mental disorder where patients have a normal mood alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episo@@ des and to prevent man@@ ic episo@@ des in patients who have responded to the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of disturbed rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when oral in@@ gest@@ ing of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases the solution can be applied or the tablets can be used in patients with the swal@@ lo@@ wing of tablets difficulties .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time , the same as A@@ bili@@ fy should be removed , the A@@ bili@@ fy dosage should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for recep@@ tors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recep@@ tors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin can play a role in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing mental or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar disorders that were suffering from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with plac@@ ebo .
in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence , in 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from disturbed rest@@ lessness , compared with which by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to the intake ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episo@@ des in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg cans were also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for taking ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled access ) , trem@@ or ( trem@@ ble ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( increased sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disturb@@ ances ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Dru@@ gs ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ bili@@ fy &apos;s benefits in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episo@@ des in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder as well as the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episo@@ des and in which the man@@ ic episo@@ des addressed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , predomin@@ ate against the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with multiple episo@@ des in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , predomin@@ ate against the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission approved the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . a permit for placing A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episo@@ des of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients displaying mostly man@@ ic episo@@ des and their man@@ ic episo@@ des addressed to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ctor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorder and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , transi@@ tions disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ing for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( dehy@@ dra@@ tion , hypo@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
if patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy are signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there was one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to und@@ esi@@ rable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no exact risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related adverse events in A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients who permit direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes Mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes Mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a degra@@ dation of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar mania because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , decreases the res@@ or@@ ption of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % while C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose re@@ ductions should be made .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites may result in common use with highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sion@@ sive metabol@@ ites .
if one considers the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose re@@ ductions should be made .
after lowering the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , A@@ bili@@ fy dosage should be lifted to the dose at the outs@@ et of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 jointly administered with A@@ bili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of humans and due to the concerns raised in animal reproduction studies , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk of the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including vehicles , to operate until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative impact on them .
the following adverse reactions occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the inci@@ dence of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of lower inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 57.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with oph@@ thal@@ mic therapy .
man@@ ic episo@@ des in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ Dis@@ order - in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 53,@@ 3 % in patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % was treated for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters , no medi@@ cally significant differences were found .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole versus 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
to the side effects related to anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their inci@@ dence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , und@@ esi@@ rable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes Mell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plasma protein .
it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is communicated over the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
in vit@@ ro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recep@@ tor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor as well as an even aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hi@@ stam@@ ine H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor .
at the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks of healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ depend@@ ant reduction in the binding of 11@@ C Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ amen .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 of the respon@@ der patients who attended study medi@@ ation were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from the measurement scales defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sions@@ advise scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of decline , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol group and at 57 % plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ tor @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study &apos; weight gain &apos; occurred , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a efficacy against plac@@ ebo superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a efficacy of plac@@ ebo superior efficacy in week 3 and an overall effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
also in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania as Lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disturb@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially talked about 2 weeks not to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirror , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabili@@ zing phase before mar@@ ginal stimulation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol prev@@ ailed against plac@@ ebo in terms of preventing a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the mania .
based on in vit@@ ro studies , the enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for dehy@@ dra@@ tion and hydro@@ xy@@ d@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ung is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean eli@@ mination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ is@@ ers via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and for approximately 146 hours with &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
simulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose trial in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and kan@@ cin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects have only been observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ depend@@ ant epi@@ der@@ mis @-@ tox@@ icity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 @-@ 10 times the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose during the human race ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gate found in the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found in the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in G@@ alle , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vit@@ ro sol@@ ub@@ ility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control the Agi@@ tier@@ edness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with multiple episo@@ des of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in order to increase the absorption and minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used already for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the features of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution in patients with Agi@@ tier@@ edness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been caused differently than by schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic episo@@ des of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is additionally considered necessary for the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme sed@@ ation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solutions are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , transi@@ tions disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ing for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( dehy@@ dra@@ tion , hypo@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .

clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a degra@@ dation of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enic patients and patients with bi@@ polar mania because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .

105 The H2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , decreases the res@@ or@@ ption of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sion@@ ers can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in higher plasma concentrations compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose re@@ ductions should be made .

107 The following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified in clinical trials involving or@@ ally applicable ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters , no medi@@ cally significant differences were found .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole versus 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .

110 and behavi@@ oral disorders were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements in Agi@@ tier@@ edness / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 hours ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as Agi@@ tier@@ edness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in the symptoms regarding the Agi@@ tier@@ edness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am reference arm .
the mean improvement of the bas@@ eline at the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episo@@ des or patients with severe Agi@@ tier@@ edness , a similar effectiveness in relation to the overall population was observed , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a decreased patient count .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 of the respon@@ der patients who attended study medi@@ ation were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from the measurement scales defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg dep@@ res@@ sive rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , a significantly higher reduction in the rate of decline was reported for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ tor @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; occurred , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in part talked about 2 weeks not to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirror , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabili@@ zing phase before mar@@ ginal stimulation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol prev@@ ailed against plac@@ ebo in terms of preventing a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the mania .
in the first 2 hours according to intra@@ mus@@ cular injection , the AU@@ C is 90 % bigger the AU@@ C after the administration of the same dose as a tablet ; system@@ ic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time was to reach the maximum plasma level in 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol In@@ j@@ ection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys , resulting in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated administration in system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - or 5 times above the maximum human therapeu@@ tical exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on the re@@ productive tox@@ icity of intra@@ ven@@ ous application there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) about the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and kan@@ cin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ depend@@ ant epi@@ der@@ mis @-@ tox@@ icity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 @-@ times the mean steady @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
these effects were observed in rab@@ bits , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the middle steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
if one considers only patients treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators , such as time and degra@@ dation of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it should also not be used in patients who breast@@ feed or have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood prior to treatment .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was not more effective in patients with which the first treatment was no longer more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that in contrast to other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs should not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission approved the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and is not shown for the treatment of standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine therapy ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sens@@ orial neu@@ rop@@ athy during Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced in the following series to 220 mg / m2 .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to Grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
there are no studies conducted with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data on recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ artic@@ ulation formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have essentially different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient may not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te speed rose to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
whereas a clearly defined kar@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity has not been proven in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents in the indicated patient collective are not unusual , especially in patients with early anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying cardi@@ ac or lung disease .
in case of patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ative means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age that do not practice effective contra@@ c@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoid@@ able .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contra@@ c@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not bear a child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sper@@ ma con@@ served , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
abra@@ sives can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect the traffic and ability to serve machinery .
listed below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane once every three weeks .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported to 71 % of patients .
ana@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in any dose and indication in trials ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ act@@ ance hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in blood , elevated blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in blood , reduced pot@@ assium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain of g@@ ums , loose stool , op@@ soph@@ ism , pain in the abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kid@@ neys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , head@@ aches , p@@ ains , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , dis@@ comfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual inci@@ dence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules drug which promotes the aggreg@@ ation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tubes and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ formation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ ference of plasma components into the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ ale transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ um@@ bi recep@@ tor and due to the alb@@ um@@ ming protein SPAR@@ C ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two random@@ ized trials and from 45@@ 4 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in form of sol@@ vent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with pre@@ medication for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % only had a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are outlined below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy for the sound at bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmaceutical grade of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 g / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active substance exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ v@@ ascular distribution and / or past@@ ure binding of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of sol@@ vent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearing of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on human liver micro@@ some and tissue hi@@ stories , Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast car@@ cin@@ oma the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine secre@@ tion was 4 % of the total dose , containing less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data on patients at the age of more than 75 years are available because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and in light of light over 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ous drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be preserved when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a ster@@ ile sy@@ ringe , it is slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de inf@@ usion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ pier@@ cing bottle .
after full delivery of the solution , the pier@@ cing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good use of the solid .
then the pier@@ cing bottle should be swi@@ v@@ elled and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes , until complete res@@ us@@ ability of the powder is done .
if precip@@ itations or sin@@ ks are visible , the pier@@ cing bottle must be inver@@ ted gently again in order to achieve complete res@@ us@@ ability prior to the application .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drugs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood trans@@ fusion , where blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur , if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the drug is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron levels of all patients are checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the whole treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , ana@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ id deficiency or that the body does not adequ@@ ately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby mi@@ tig@@ ate the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was produced , enabling it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a v@@ ein in a v@@ ein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
in all patients participating in this study , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein at least eight weeks before they were either um@@ um@@ ed to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were changed to Ab@@ se@@ amed were uph@@ eld in the same degree as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in accordance with the European Union regulations , the medicine has been proved that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which establishes Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce Arzneimittel P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG .
treatment of ana@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion in adults with solid tum@@ ors , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ plex@@ es of my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is based on the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing ana@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with which ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
because of the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed via or under the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
given this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the lasting hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is 25 % .
patients should be monitored eng@@ mes@@ hed to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of ana@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

symptoms of an@@ emia and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor .
given this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the patients should be monitored eng@@ mes@@ hed to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required to control an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tik@@ u@@ loid numbers of ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week .
when the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tik@@ u@@ loid number &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl compared to the bas@@ eline , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tik@@ u@@ loid number has increased ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl , the dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week .

patients with slight ana@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary intake of ≥ 4 blood con@@ v@@ ents is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive up to 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa pi@@ cks 300 I.@@ U. / kg each on 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine into the circulation system .
patients who suffer from a ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin at a ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ loc@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ loc@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina p@@ ect@@ oris , increased risk for deep ven@@ ous tum@@ ours ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
in patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c operation and which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , companion or underlying disease , v@@ ascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recent heart attack or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ loc@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ based PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the reverse cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid , or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ ums tox@@ ic@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ oo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the ana@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten &quot; index &quot; ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0,5 % ) , which are determined by th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers , and if no other cause of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be investigated .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ icity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for anti @-@ antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In case of chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in clinical trials , an increased risk of mort@@ ality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefits attributed to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control an@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ denti@@ al cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , the treatment of ana@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in case of tumour patients under chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who need to be trans@@ f@@ used ) .
if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dosage must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therapeutic an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing under the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic procedure , if possible , prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic procedure should receive adequate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis because they have an increased risk of oste@@ o@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , an increased risk of post@@ operative thro@@ mb@@ otic / v@@ ascular events may exist in the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial mus@@ cular level of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic ana@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy , when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in@@ do@@ sis can be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vit@@ ro studies on tumor tissues there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
about thro@@ mb@@ otic , v@@ ascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al im@@ ams , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ cts , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( brain bleeding , brain inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , intra@@ ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ lia , lung em@@ bo@@ lia , retin@@ al thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys was reported in patients with Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of existing hyper@@ tension .
increased inci@@ dence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ v@@ ascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations to thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular complications .
the gene@@ tically obtained epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ lic and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate share with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown using cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
389 patients with hem@@ ost@@ atic tum@@ ors ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin &apos;s lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ ost@@ atic tum@@ ors , 64 gy@@ nec@@ ological tum@@ ors , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas , 22 prostate car@@ cin@@ omas , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal car@@ cin@@ omas and 30 more ) .

survival and progression were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etic patients with ana@@ emia were consistent with an un@@ clari@@ fied , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality than in the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the inci@@ dence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ ic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are applied to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transferring a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa laws after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa &apos;s ser@@ um levels are much lower than the ser@@ um levels achieved after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis is a known comp@@ lication of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be caused by secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the inci@@ dence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal studies with approxim@@ ate the 20@@ ble of the recommended weekly dosage , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced f@@ ö@@ thal@@ ous body weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in f@@ ec@@ al mort@@ ality .

• have suffered a heart attack or stroke within one month before your treatment • If you suffer from un@@ stable ang@@ ina p@@ ect@@ oris ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of blood graf@@ ting in the v@@ eins ( deep Ven@@ enth@@ ro@@ mb@@ oses ) - if , for example , such a blood @-@ graf@@ ting occurred in you , for example .
you suffer from severe blood circulation disorders ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( periph@@ eral arter@@ ial inf@@ ectious disease ) , the cer@@ eb@@ ral v@@ ascular disease ( v@@ ascular disease of the car@@ ot@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can result in a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in blood plat@@ el@@ es within the normal range , which re@@ forms in case of further treatment .
your doctor will perform regular blood tests if necessary to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , resolution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated before beginning of therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ based ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ oc@@ op@@ enia after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you are suffering from ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ loc@@ ia , it will break your therapy with Ab@@ sin@@ amed and determine how your ana@@ emia is best handled .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by inj@@ ecting into a v@@ ein ( intra@@ ven@@ ous ) if you are treated due to an an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death .
in case of increased or increasing pot@@ assium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the pot@@ assium values are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or dam@@ aging sign by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a given value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of blood im@@ pover@@ ishment with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney disease ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to minim@@ ise the risk of blood graf@@ ting ( thro@@ mb@@ otic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed in relation to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of oste@@ o@@ otic v@@ ascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if there are already oste@@ o@@ otic v@@ ascular events occurring in the past ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed works like a growth factor for blood cells , and under certain circumstances may affect the tumour neg@@ atively .
if a larger orthop@@ edi@@ c operation is about to undergo , before treatment begins with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed since an increased risk of blood graf@@ ting after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take / use other medicines / / or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription drugs .
if you are taking Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are the means for building up the immune system , for example for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your ana@@ emia ( ana@@ emia ) refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works correctly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a given value .
once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally big inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a given value .
depending on how the ana@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a given value , the treating physician will conduct regular blood tests .
if necessary to sh@@ orten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given to 10 consecutive days before the surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after the surgery .

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ tures risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a trau@@ matic hi@@ ft as in case of H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ ck , an illness that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first inf@@ usion or by inj@@ ecting into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days following the inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
A@@ cl@@ asta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta .
in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ tures ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months .
the main indicator for efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood is again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cl@@ asta Over@@ side effects occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ onate or other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ asta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the inf@@ usion point and oste@@ opor@@ osis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
A@@ cl@@ asta &apos;s producer provides educational material to physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as a similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should consult the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to author@@ ise A@@ cl@@ asta in the whole European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg of A@@ cl@@ asta is once annually recommended .
in patients with a low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ tures ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , a long term of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure adequate intake of calcium , twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a very low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or@@ inal or intra@@ mus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta may be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ atine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adol@@ escents A@@ cl@@ asta are not recommended for use in children and adol@@ escents under 18 years of age , as data for the harm@@ lessness and effectiveness are missing .
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population .
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta before starting treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure adequate intake of calcium , twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene ) should be carried out before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental surgery , no data is available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days of administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the inci@@ dence of adverse events reported by atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ asta ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0,6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ ZON - Recur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) , overall inci@@ dence of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions associated with ren@@ al ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited ren@@ al function were in a clinical study at oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed at 1.8 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo versus 0.8 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , showed up to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study on the prevention of oste@@ opor@@ osis after a hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently learned hip frac@@ tures , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study , local reactions to the inf@@ usion area , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ opor@@ osis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area has been known primarily in cancer patients , over oste@@ opor@@ osis ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interfer@@ ences .
7 studies with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area in one with A@@ cl@@ asta and in a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
in the case of an over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , an equ@@ ation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years with either a bone density lid ≤ -@@ 1,5 and at least two light or medium @-@ severe existing verteb@@ ral fra@@ cture or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2,5 with or without any signs of an existing fluid body fra@@ cture .
effects on morph@@ ometric frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta lo@@ wered significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta demonstrated a consistent lasting effect over three years resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ral acid , hip and dist@@ al radius , compared with plac@@ ebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 In@@ cre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the thig@@ h around 5.2 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es were taken from the pel@@ vic spon@@ ge .
a micro@@ computer@@ tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume compared to plac@@ ebo in comparison to plac@@ ebo , and the preservation of tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 517 to 1,@@ 246 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ asta reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value of 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value of 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. l@@ itt@@ oral or intra@@ mus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before the inf@@ usion .
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ ZON @-@ RF@@ T study , the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment increased the BM@@ D compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment led more than 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % on the total balance and 4.3 % on the thig@@ h .
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ ZON @-@ RF@@ T study was random@@ ized 508 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the inci@@ dence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta was not inferior to the percentage change in lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ chens A@@ cl@@ asta was examined in patients aged more than 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , particularly light to moderate Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.7 @-@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily for 2 months has been proven in two six @-@ month comparison studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain of pain was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients participating in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response at 141 patients with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , could be maintained in an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minute inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients gave the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
then the plasma bar decreased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bio @-@ phase dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination peak time of ½ γ 146 hours .
the early distribution stages ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kid@@ neys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dosage 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a reduced clearance of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances by Cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , met@@ abolic inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was at the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and moderate kidney dys@@ functions down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing up to 35 ml@@ . / min does not require a dose adaptation of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid .
as for heavy kidney dys@@ functions ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ let@@ ally acting intra@@ ven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies on dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C were six times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub @-@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity In studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was given in rats by administered intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ day intervals , in total 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , referring to the AU@@ C , equ@@ als ) , toler@@ ated well .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to cum@@ ulated exposure positions , which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects with other organs including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection point .
the most common use in trials with repeated use was a multip@@ ly primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hy@@ si@@ cs of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an inf@@ est@@ ation that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats , one observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity of dos@@ ages from 0,2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embr@@ yo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity was distinctive at 0.1 mg / kg due to the reduced ser@@ um calcium mirror .

z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ onate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the mor@@ bus pa@@ get of the bone .
decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens made of andro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , bon@@ ing is too fast , and new bone material is structured in@@ order , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
A@@ cl@@ asta acts as it norm@@ alizes the bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus gives the bones again strength .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ asta .
if you use A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you take / use other medicines / / or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines from which it is known to damage the kid@@ neys .
when using A@@ cl@@ asta , along with food and drink , you are worried that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you have sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ tures .
the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
since A@@ cl@@ asta acts for a long time , you may need to take another dose once a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium mirror in your blood in time after inf@@ usion is not too low .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
before termination of therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta if you are considering the termination of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please perceive your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects in connection with the first inf@@ usion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , however , less frequent after the following inf@@ usions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta .

if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta lasts two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ tures .
before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atically current , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding to at least twice daily 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in patients with a low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures , an initial dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or@@ inal or intra@@ mus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta .

in addition , four studies have been conducted to over 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a supp@@ or@@ tive tool to adjust the smoking compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , the studies on setting up smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application .
which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? he The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia noted during the studies ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory system .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or are treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can cause suicide thanks to a small minority of patients .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Review Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which it explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not shown .
it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly obes@@ e patients ) , which cannot be satis@@ factory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ ated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl rubber or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin and insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , whereby type 2 diabetes can be adjusted better .
in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ t study , the effect of the additional administration of ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ yl resin in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional plac@@ ebo injection led to a reduction of 0.35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin had been studied in 289 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin have decreased H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.0@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who also took plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual disturb@@ ances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ a@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other ingredients , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ( high k@@ et@@ one mirror - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the import of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or int@@ oler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients affected by the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserves .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease has been performed .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in patients with elevated liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror is increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be monitored as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms which point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , upper stomach problems , fatigue , appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be guided by clinical evaluation until the laboratory parameters are present .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , there was a slight reduction in the mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral double or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ f@@ onic acid or dual combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch was reported under treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , about occurrence or deteri@@ oration of di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct link between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but or@@ derly doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report about disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated fra@@ cture inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medi@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ ation .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to receive a pregnancy or enter it , the treatment is to be cancelled ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not perform relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A redu@@ ct@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 indu@@ ctor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernity unit decreases and thereby decreases the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 1000 ; &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the refra@@ ctive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T asc@@ ents above three times the upper limit of the normal range also frequently appeared as under plac@@ ebo , but less rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin .
in an out@@ come study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease the inci@@ dence of severe heart failure in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one res@@ ides .
since the market launch has rarely been reported on con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , however , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients were performed in the groups treated with compar@@ ision medication .
in the Pro@@ Active Study period spann@@ ing over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ision medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms appeared .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on appears to act on activ@@ ating specific nuclear recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ator ) activated by re@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glu@@ cos@@ ine production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral glucose util@@ isation in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been conducted over two years to examine the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the treatment commen@@ ced , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin was random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients suffering from pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in clinical studies over a year .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small examination of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics in a small , 18 @-@ week study .
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slight , but clin@@ ically non @-@ significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced overall plas@@ tic@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level over a period of up to two years .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on whereas values were observed under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both in effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and present advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized to receive either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardiovascular treatment .
after oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the efficacy in roughly three times the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minim@@ ally pronounced .
in interaction studies , it could be proven that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 / indu@@ ctor ) or lo@@ wers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ active mark@@ eted Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the waste ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma elimination period of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and all active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearing of the mother substance are similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys were in accordance with repeated administration plasma volume aug@@ mentation with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ex@@ centric cor@@ on@@ ary hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernity unit decreases and thereby decreases the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased inci@@ dence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( male rats ) were induced by the ureth@@ ra epithel@@ ium .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an resulted in increased frequency of col@@ oni@@ ums .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated fra@@ cture inci@@ dence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medi@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ ation .
another study of two years has investigated the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in , each with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or gli@@ o@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
clinical trials for more than 1 year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents in comparison to the initial values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both in effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eride synthesis .
although the study missed the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal M@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one there are no cardiovascular long @-@ time risks associated .

in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who were treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients who received comparative medi@@ ation showed an increased inci@@ dence of bone frac@@ tures in women .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c sp@@ eg@@ els suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were significantly reduced like with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package case ) .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks associated with diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the launch of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day , when a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dosage was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar adjustment has improved significantly , for example , by intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be changed and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding thickness , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bio @-@ phase , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA opposite insulin origin ) may cause a change of dosage needed .
if the change to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is required in patients with dosage adjustment , this may be necessary at the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and always consult his patients after other medicines taken by them .
4 hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or con@@ vul@@ sions and end with temporary or permanent disturb@@ ances of brain function and even death .
disorders of the nervous system , Neu@@ rop@@ athy - Periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of the blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute pain neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement of blood sugar adjustment can however be associated with a temporary deteri@@ oration of di@@ ab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and skin @-@ skin tissue jel@@ ly - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy An injection site may create a pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if failed to switch in@@ sti@@ ch@@ points within the injection range .
general diseases and complaints at the administration site Gel@@ occasionally - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) .
disorders of the immune system Yellow - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rarely - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alised r@@ ash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , g@@ astro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ otic ede@@ ma , breathing difficulties , low blood pressure and impot@@ ence / un@@ consciousness .
however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sugar @-@ containing foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape cand@@ y , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cu@@ its , or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven auxiliary person or by glucose , which is given intra@@ ven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration amounts to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed absorption .
a number of hydro@@ ly@@ sis loc@@ alities on the human insulin molec@@ ule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is taken from the fridge - the temperature of insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) increases before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ed according to the manual for the first use .
some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and always consult his patients after other medicines taken by them .
12 hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
13 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement of blood sugar adjustment can however be associated with a temporary deteri@@ oration of di@@ ab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .
the termin@@ ale half @-@ life time ( t ½ ) is therefore rather a measure of res@@ or@@ ption as a measure of elimination per se of insulin from the plasma ( insulin has a t ½ of only a few minutes in the blood@@ stream ) .

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin humane ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d across the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin must first be raised , then the amount of insulin acting .
3 If the change to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d is required in the patient a dose adaptation , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration amounts to about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adol@@ escents The phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ k@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d was examined at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ ab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adol@@ escents is similar to that of adults .

A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already signs of cryst@@ alline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or rheum@@ atic notes ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger urine cryst@@ alli@@ zation that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , g@@ noc@@ ents can still occur , so it is recommended that patients with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic are still taking additional medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks during the first six months with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended for children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study on which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( head@@ medi@@ cam@@ ents ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once a day of 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were below 6 mg / dl in the blood during the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) patients who took A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) patients who received 120 mg once a day , with the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ uria ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and ab@@ normal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart complaints in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to urine drainage ( including one of the patient &apos;s history known or currently available , and / or arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily can be taken into consideration .
in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated yet ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adol@@ escents since there are no experiences in children and adol@@ escents , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recep@@ tors , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or un@@ controlled con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ ns@@ dating drugs , it can come to acute g@@ out attacks during the treatment , because the reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ ic acid can initially be mobili@@ zed in the tissue by lowering the ser@@ um har@@ ic acid .
B. for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver diseases Dur@@ ing the phase 3 clinical trials , mild ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of the Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ sta treatment and in the further course depending on clinical findings and a liver function test ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was no exchange rate studies carried out to Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times a day associated with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ s exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .

in a study with subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of D@@ esi@@ pra@@ mine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which points to a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , the recording of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) delayed and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C causes .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal @-@ experimental studies do not include direct or indirect dam@@ aging effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or performing dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher inci@@ dence of cardiovascular events reported in the investig@@ ator showed in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1,3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term renewal studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be established .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the patient &apos;s history .
common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse events that could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all of the treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients who are also treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe skin fail@@ ures or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term prolong@@ ation studies In the open long @-@ term prolong@@ ation studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years .
the related events reported during long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all of the Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ e- treatment groups , and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term prolong@@ ation studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies in phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hyp@@ a@@ esth@@ esia , show@@ y E@@ KG , cou@@ gh , short@@ ness , skin f@@ ainting , skin l@@ esi@@ ons , kidney failure , erectile dysfunction , rise in the concentration of the blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decrease in the number of white blood cells .
mechanism of action ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and is produced as part of the reaction cas@@ cade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is a powerful , non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for the in vit@@ ro @-@ in@@ hibition left below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients with which the last three monthly ser@@ um har@@ den levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cancer value for study start from &gt; 1,5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the reduction of ser@@ um har@@ ic acid to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um car@@ cin@@ inate values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( d. h .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decline of ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects , despite their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the group of patients with ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl 2.5 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of ser@@ um rates at &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 required a treatment against a g@@ um ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a g@@ um ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the toxic node size , resulting in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the po@@ ison no@@ des by month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ A / m@@ L ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to administration easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional .
for the doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in the ser@@ um resin concentration was observed , if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 liters after consumption of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at &apos;s plasma gas binding is approximately 9@@ 9,@@ 2 % ( primary binding on alb@@ um@@ in ) and is consistent with the concentration width reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vit@@ ro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ eted Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as an unchanged Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 30 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as an unchanged Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups kidney failure After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean total AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with lighter ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh Classi@@ fication A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver dysfunction , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function .
alter There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ air@@ ment of fertility In male rats was found a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( interim cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the high @-@ dose treated group , with about 11 @-@ times exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical application .
it has been noted that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and re@@ productive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
in case of high doses , which were about 4.@@ 9 times of human therapeu@@ tical exposure , mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity occurred , which went along with a reduction in breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , approximately 4.3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to approximately 13 times the human@@ ist exposure , had no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder where bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplement ) .
to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and Vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE regarding increasing the vitamin D level .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only recorded Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also stipul@@ ates that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , p@@ ains of mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of diges@@ tive appar@@ at@@ uses such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diges@@ tive disorders ) , ul@@ cer ( ul@@ c@@ era ) of es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( swal@@ lo@@ wing ) , suction @-@ driven abdom@@ en , as well as sau@@ res .
in patients with severe hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE must not be applied .
it must not be applied in case of diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low cal@@ ci@@ fication mirror ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following indications are to be followed exactly to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after treatment of the day . • The patients should not che@@ w the tablet or put the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B . pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , except p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , are given only under special care ( see Section 4.3 ) .
mal@@ ign@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al frac@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially these were severe and required a hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all the signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end symptoms of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain in swal@@ lo@@ wing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ m@@ ble heart@@ burn , and take medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who are not taking the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms pointing to mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was detected , rare ( after market launch ) Mag@@ en- and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose therapy ime contains mainly intra@@ ven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ onate .
there is no data available to indicate whether the setting of bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who need a max@@ il@@ surgical procedure , reduces the risk of a oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is crucial for therapeutic planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instru@@ cted to take the tablet next morning when taking the dose of an AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE dose after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as planned on the planned week of the week .
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequ@@ ately before beginning treatment with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is intended only for use in post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate do not allow any indication of directly harmful effects in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients but also in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients were also reported .
nevertheless , the ser@@ um @-@ cal@@ ci@@ ums up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were performed in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at In@@ stead of oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract like stomach up@@ set , heart@@ burn , op@@ es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the conversion of 7 @-@ dehy@@ dra@@ tion to vitamin D3 .

the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tures in post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the Fra@@ ktur intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6,@@ 459 ) .
in the phase III trials mean the mean asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3.2 % versus plac@@ ebo 6.@@ 2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients suffering one or more verteb@@ ra@@ e frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of verteb@@ ral column and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to pers@@ ist ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ oral neck and the entire body was maintained .
it consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and subsequently 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the appearance of at least one new spine by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Based on an intra@@ ven@@ ous reference dose , the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate at women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after noc@@ tur@@ nal fast@@ ings and two hours before the intake of a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability increased to approximately 0.46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in Oste@@ opor@@ os@@ est@@ udi@@ en , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( increase in the range of 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats have shown that al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is distributed in soft tissue after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly circul@@ ated into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , about 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the com@@ part@@ ments .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was 71 ml / min and the system@@ ic clearance is not 200 ml / min .
in rats , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not believed that in humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines is affected by these transport systems .
absorption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) , after the gift of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE , after noc@@ tur@@ nal fast and two hours before the intake of a meal , the medium surface is below the ser@@ um concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng • h / ml ( excluding endo@@ genous vitamin D3 ) .
the mean maximum concentration in the ser@@ um ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D3 was 5,@@ 9 ng / ml and the medi@@ ation until reaching the maximum ser@@ um concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
in the liver , biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation vitamin D3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ ated in the liver and then met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in the kidney to 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion At the gift of radio@@ active marked vitamin D3 to healthy volunteers , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the cases after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine .
although no clinical data is present , it is still expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as in the animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , patients with reduced kidney function can expect a somewhat increased accumulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in bones ( see Section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients to which a kidney or liver has been transplan@@ ted to prevent the rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , while the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a year of treatment ( for example investigating how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a res@@ ump@@ tion of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , more recent studies have been conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and investig@@ ates how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft .

in patients with severe hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other ingredients may not be applied .
patients and doctors need to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with adv@@ an@@ age , as the adv@@ an@@ age dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased inci@@ dence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see sections 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adaptation must be performed to ensure that system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood @-@ level measurements ( see below &quot; Recomm@@ end@@ ations &quot;
after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels should be checked before switching over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , system@@ ic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ agra@@ f D@@ os@@ is@@ schem@@ as can last several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post@@ operative phase does not allow oral in@@ gest@@ ing of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca .
the duration of the application For supp@@ ression of gra@@ ft rejection , the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - Nier@@ enz@@ transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sion The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be required later , since pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sion The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust must be converted a Tran@@ splan@@ t Receiver of twice daily dosage of Progra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion has to be done in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation must begin for pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to adv@@ ent , an oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recep@@ tors although there are no clinical experience with adv@@ an@@ - , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as@@ - and bo@@ wel @-@ transplan@@ ted patients , came into an oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in p@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tes in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in case of intestinal transplan@@ t recep@@ tors in an oral initial dose of 0,3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintaining blood levels in the targeted area may be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dose adaptation is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um Cre@@ atine insp@@ iegel , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ cts and a monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
conversion from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in- to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the blood level in the whole blood The dose should primarily stem from the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low controls .
it is recommended to perform common controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while applying substances which could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the per@@ spi@@ ration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recep@@ tors , blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has resulted in serious adverse events including transplan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sions or other side effects which may occur in consequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
for pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recep@@ tors and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
because of possible interactions , which can lead to a degra@@ dation of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , is to be avoided or other plant enh@@ ancers during treatment with adv@@ an@@ ate ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentrations in the blood is offered , as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels may be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , it was possible to observe a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturb@@ ances are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid pollution and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a solar protection device with a high protection factor .
if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ ache , altered states of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and visual disturb@@ ances , should have a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ ances contain hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ose , l@@ act@@ ose , special caution is recommended in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption .
simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or indu@@ ctors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or lower blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood levels while taking substances that can change the metabolism of the CY@@ P@@ 3A and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain consistent concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was treated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole , and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the rise in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabolism .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism imp@@ air .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious when decisions regarding contra@@ cep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal tests have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially l@@ essen the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in the uter@@ o exposition , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) .

cases of BK virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progres@@ si@@ tive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative conditions and skin tum@@ ors associated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high connection to ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it is assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may be convey@@ ed by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ enic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of sign@@ alling path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the T cells dependent prolifer@@ ation of the B cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin 2 recep@@ tor .

overall , the safety profile of oral programs in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the observations in the major studies in which Progra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recep@@ tors for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis using a recently conducted , multic@@ enter study with oral programs has been reported to more than 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
also chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .

the number of cases where Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.0@@ 2 ) than the number of patients who were killed by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute transplan@@ t impact was increased after 6 months ( 50.@@ 7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the patients of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ splan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the inci@@ dence of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syn@@ dro@@ mes with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus patients was significantly lower .

the oral initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to the desired level of the valley from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
intestinal transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral programs as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ tations revealed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ des and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a rein@@ forcement of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion primarily via the bile .
the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Progra@@ f in stable patients ( twice a day ) on Adv@@ agra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .
it is recommended to perform common controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection which has proven to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturb@@ ances are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid pollution and ede@@ ma .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether Adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII @-@ lack , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced by a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling it to form the human scent factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar but is produced differently so that the medicine contains no proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated .
in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ sis with &quot; excellent &quot; and &quot; good &quot; was assessed .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
adv@@ ent may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or one of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG for the launch of Adv@@ ate in the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency , according to the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity during the corresponding period does not sink under the given plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
inj@@ ections every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
during the treatment process , a proper determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma is recommended to control the dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in response to factor VIII , varying in vi@@ vo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ time periods .
3 Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A doses should be given between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities are not achieved , or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be weigh@@ ed .
the appointment speed should depend on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VIII is a well known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ P ) with more than 100 exposure times and an@@ am@@ n@@ esia @-@ known inhibit@@ ors development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occurring of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences over the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the AD@@ R@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which had a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rarely &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estim@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els appeared post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ operative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ OC @-@ inf@@ usion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma as well as the clearing rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th post@@ operative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic difficult to moderate hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor VII ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or type ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ OC .
in addition , in any of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate Hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was detected after prior exposure to factor VII ( ≥ 50 days ) .
previously untreated patients from a current clinical study were 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ OC treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contamination prot@@ eine was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ tres against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but there were no signs or symptoms pointed to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were nar@@ row@@ ly reported on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ oph@@ ile gran@@ u@@ lo@@ c@@ ysts in several repeated product ex@@ positions in the study .
7 As with other intra@@ ven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ ATE reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of allergic types including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VIII works as a C@@ of@@ ak@@ tor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate Hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( basic value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ OC in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP continued to evaluate the benefits risk mi@@ tigation as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the A@@ DV@@ OC safety profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a fil@@ ing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited announced that Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company res@@ umes its application for approval for the in@@ junction of Adv@@ ex@@ in to treat Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that bind other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been altered in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus trigger no infections in humans .
advoc@@ ates would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling cancer cells to re@@ build the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is produced from the p@@ 53 gene in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill cells if DNA cannot be restored .
if Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient , where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer appeared in the field of sub@@ structure , bone and brain .
after CH@@ MP checked the answers of the company to the questions asked him , there were still some questions un@@ answered .
based on the review of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours brings benefits to patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate use &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are put together so that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other is released slowly over a couple of hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( ha@@ y fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al sw@@ elling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adol@@ escents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of Aer@@ ina@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that is to be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membrane ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be rel@@ oc@@ ated to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effect dimensions were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the trial patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all ha@@ y fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients reported that they took a decrease in symptoms of 46.@@ 0 % compared to 35.@@ 9 % in the patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients in Aer@@ ina@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ts , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or one of the other ingredients , anti @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another drug for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow @-@ angle glau@@ coma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or v@@ ascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ) or a ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( stroke caused by brain bleeding ) or have a risk of a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of Aer@@ ina@@ è@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to swal@@ low the whole ( i.e. without sh@@ red@@ ding , to break or che@@ w ) .
due to the lack of data on the harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not continue after the symptoms of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days since long @-@ term use can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after a decrease in the sw@@ elling of mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
as Aer@@ ina@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after the treatment has ended .
this is attri@@ but@@ able to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other v@@ aso@@ con@@ stri@@ ctors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , cer@@ go@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , g@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , or other de@@ con@@ ges@@ tion , which can be attributed to per@@ oral or nas@@ al ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data is insufficient to pronoun@@ ce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ ina@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pronoun@@ ce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or p@@ alp@@ itations , heart rhyth@@ ms , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be cancelled .
patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck reconstruction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing the mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
in the course of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally given , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alter@@ ations of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with the di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether it was taken by the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ ina@@ lance during pregnancy is not assured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to inci@@ dence in the normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the v@@ aso@@ con@@ stri@@ ction characteristics of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , Aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a disease that can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of the traffic or the ability to serve machines .
the symptoms may vary between a C@@ NS depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a C@@ NS @-@ stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ or , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible Latvian trials .
head@@ ache , anxiety , difficult mi@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , p@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pain , depres@@ sions , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturb@@ ances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a Z@@ NS @-@ stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ il @-@ rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the in@@ hibition of the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ iles and the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on @-@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose trial with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gli@@ ding including the ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo was observed in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a Z@@ NS arous@@ al .
1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years participated with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , with 414 patients received Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets was significantly higher compared to the overall cor@@ es for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous sw@@ elling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous sw@@ elling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin about the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets did not show significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ ina@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration .
following the per@@ oral application of healthy volunteers for 14 days , the flow equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on Day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ disciplinary study conducted with the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects , it was noted that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin are poor@@ ly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , however , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin cannot detect any special haz@@ ards for humans .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in re@@ productive @-@ tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was very rare about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulty , whi@@ stling breath , it@@ ching , n@@ ettle r@@ ash and sw@@ elling ) or r@@ ashes .
about cases of p@@ alp@@ itations , heart ch@@ ase , stomach pain , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , stomach pain , diar@@ rhe@@ a , sleep disorders , muscle p@@ ains , cra@@ mps , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous liver values have also been reported very rarely .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - and 5 mg tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml @-@ solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adol@@ escents with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by investigating the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of squares , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to the intake and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harm@@ less .
in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , when the results of all studies were considered , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us led to an average decrease in symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria the decrease in symptom scores was six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted approval to the company SP Europe for the use of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adol@@ escents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( occur@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should take place according to the present disease progression and can be stopped after the end of symptoms and reg@@ res@@ onate when re@@ occurring .
in the per@@ si@@ sting allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( occur@@ ence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can be accepted , which can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of the traffic or the ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in different indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect head@@ ache was the most common side effect , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose trial , at which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ iles and the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on @-@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed itself .
in a single dose trial with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gli@@ ding including the ampli@@ fication of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis can be classified as dependent on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and per@@ si@@ sting allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ si@@ sting allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the strain caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined representative for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , despite the eti@@ ology , is similar in different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily .
as the hi@@ stam@@ ine replacement is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of sp@@ ind@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disturb@@ ance of sleep and w@@ ax@@ ing significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients @-@ demo@@ s were comparable to the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant accumulation once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines are not excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin not inhi@@ bited in vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose trial with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg meals ( fatty alcohol rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the pre@@ clinical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the tox@@ icity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin cannot detect any special haz@@ ards for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available to support a treatment of inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin studies should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and experience a higher level of endurance ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metabolism normally .
this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ l@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ ch@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall inci@@ dence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adol@@ escents in different indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi@@ disciplinary study of adults and adol@@ escents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects have been observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years who were eligible for anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adol@@ escents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adol@@ escents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed itself .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adol@@ escents was no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adol@@ escents in clinical trials do not cause any imp@@ air@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol neither increases alcohol @-@ induced performance imp@@ air@@ ment nor an increase in dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and you@@ thful patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as demonstrated by the overall cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of sp@@ ind@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restricted gene phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ disciplinary study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , which are restricted to metabolism .
the load ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adol@@ escents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients at the recommended doses with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us Sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ id bottles with a child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hi@@ lic acid can be removed without dam@@ aging them .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in different indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets per day than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose trial , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ ate was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vitality signs and EC@@ G @-@ interval data .
as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.r.l. indi@@ cted the Human Medic@@ ines Committee ( CH@@ MP ) for approval to prevent A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov &apos;s authorization to prevent avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vacc@@ ine that should protect from a strain of flu virus which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man , because human beings do not yet have an immun@@ ity ( no protection ) on the other hand .
after the vacc@@ ine administration , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus in the vacc@@ ine as a &quot; alien &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to produce antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this tribe .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , det@@ ects the human body as a body &apos;s foreign ) , was cleaned up and used as a component of the vacc@@ ine .
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for ass@@ essing the safety of the vacc@@ ine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to the intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked out which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood of the virus will respond to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ generation is based on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases related to AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with 206 adults , formerly known as prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / m@@ L than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the viral load , but only very few were treated to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine increased with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r A@@ gener@@ ase the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase , along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , came to a stronger decline in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of a@@ generation ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who have Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are degra@@ ded in the same way as as@@ ec@@ ase and are inj@@ uri@@ ous in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take a@@ generation are the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ opor@@ osis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of a@@ generation in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ k@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefits of a@@ generation in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who did not have a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or are not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Limited a permit for the transport of a@@ generation in the whole European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children aged 4 years .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient &apos;s pre @-@ treatment ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of as@@ ec@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of a@@ generation in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors have not been studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for the harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with medicines which possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ Enzy@@ mes 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations that contain Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a decreased therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ ec@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ generation prevents the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , asp@@ ec@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic h@@ epatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy have increased risk of liver side effects with potentially fatal progression .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of h@@ epatitis B or C please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with reduced liver function including a chronic @-@ active h@@ epatitis show increased inci@@ dence of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that can be metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the side kidney function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A redu@@ ct@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Stand@@ ardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , a@@ generation may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives may be changed , however , the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the potential risk of tox@@ icity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ engl@@ y@@ col@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
a@@ generation should be reduced in duration 5 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases that were needed to treat medicines that are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors such as lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders associated with it .
in H@@ äm@@ oph@@ ila patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous perc@@ ut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ at@@ omas are present .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ences , an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) , leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body @-@ Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ opor@@ osis in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic lati@@ tude are not allowed at the same time with drugs that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ Enzy@@ mes 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with drugs whose agents are confused predominantly through CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resulting in vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the reduced plasma levels by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , und@@ esi@@ rable effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of plant preparations with Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut , the am@@ pren@@ ate mirrors and , if possible , check the virus load and susp@@ end the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
508 % is increased , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily used to demonstrate the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment regim@@ en .
52 % degra@@ ded when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was given .
the C@@ min @-@ values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma which were achieved in combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with calcium ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out for use of a@@ generation in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the ant@@ acid component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase differ at least one hour ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adaptation is required .
treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and available limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin might lo@@ wers the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advisable , because del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made since an accurate predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administ@@ er Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dosage , although there are no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with a@@ generation in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been performed , however the plasma bars of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2,@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value which was observed once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or indu@@ ctors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can possibly lead to interactions with a@@ generation .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions linked to these drugs if they are used in combination with a@@ generation .
based on the data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as as@@ ec@@ ase since it can cause res@@ or@@ ption .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme du@@ ctors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine
the simultaneous consumption of A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase its plasma concentrations and strengthen with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , vision disturb@@ ances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg of flu@@ tic@@ ason@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the Flu@@ tic@@ ason@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate deposits increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % exposure interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of a@@ generation with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with this glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ id , unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG Co@@ A redu@@ ct@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to expect pronounced increases in plasma bars while simultaneously administration of a@@ generation .
as plasma @-@ level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A redu@@ ct@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to My@@ opathy including a rh@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this drug with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
a more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations is recommended as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased at the same time by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , a@@ generation should not be applied together with or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while with simultaneous use of a@@ generation with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable .
data on simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3- to 4 @-@ fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at the moment , as am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is to be adjusted at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives is not predict@@ able , therefore also alternative methods for contra@@ c@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time by A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this drug may be used only after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for fet@@ us .
in the milk of l@@ act@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the in@@ filtration in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the further development of the descendants , including fertility and re@@ productive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ generation was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , coming up early and rarely led to the outbreak of the treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of a@@ generation or another at the same time used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of disease .
most of the adverse events listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which previously untreated patients received 1200 mg of a@@ generation twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medi@@ ation and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and isolated fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ ine for a mean period of 36 weeks , only one case ( st@@ acks ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , in 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre@@ treated patients under am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) were found in 241 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ular nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spont@@ aneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spont@@ aneously within two weeks without having to break the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
oste@@ opor@@ osis cases were particularly reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
in case of HIV @-@ infected patients with a severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of a@@ generation twice a day together with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , species and inci@@ dence of side effects ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception was increased increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which were treated very frequently in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary supp@@ or@@ tive measures can be initiated .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the process of viral Gag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ vor@@ stages with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non inf@@ ectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % protein concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of the HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated regim@@ en with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in six@@ teen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be studied gen@@ otyp@@ ically .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates from 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 patients , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not previously treated , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , A@@ 71@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses of gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and a reduced lik@@ eli@@ hood of vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always bring the current interpretation systems to analyse the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( isol@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret results of resistance testing .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ asing inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with which a Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ators ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ators ) and Ti@@ fli@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ators ) .
on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a fail@@ ing therapy is recommended to stop the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
the receipt of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI previously treated adults ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to a@@ generation , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ sist@@ ence threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the receipt of the effectiveness of un@@ bi@@ ased A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ xi@@ ase solution was examined three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.@@ 5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ generation should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) amounts to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ ob@@ stru@@ cted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of the free active ingredient varies throughout the dosing interval , depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be administered with care if they are given at the same time with a@@ generation ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposition like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is made from solution 14 % less bio @-@ bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also , ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be low to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma mirrors comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on c@@ ann@@ ul@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , which were to the 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application , gave little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vit@@ ro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ nucle@@ us test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al aber@@ ration tests on human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and demonstrated in daily life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity .
so far , no significant liver tox@@ icity has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of a@@ generation nor after the end of treatment .
studies on the tox@@ icity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed which point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of as@@ ec@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with severe or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Stand@@ ardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available .
a@@ generation should be reduced to 27 when a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and associated met@@ abolic disorders such as a lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resulting in vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
508 % is increased , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma which were achieved in combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with calcium ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made since an accurate predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administ@@ er Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although there are no clinical data available .
ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ce@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@
in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg of flu@@ tic@@ ason@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the Flu@@ tic@@ ason@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate deposits increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % exposure interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1,0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or respectively .
this drug may be used only after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the in@@ filtration in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ generation was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary supp@@ or@@ tive measures can be initiated .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ing ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0,50 µg / ml ) .
on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ generation should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of the free active ingredient varies throughout the dosing interval , depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be administered with care if they are given at the same time with a@@ generation ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be low to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on c@@ ann@@ ul@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ el@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application , however , gave little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vit@@ ro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ nucle@@ us test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al aber@@ rations on human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on the tox@@ icity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young animals the metabol@@ isation paths are not fully mature , so am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children aged 4 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not covered with PI previously treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to the intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ ve@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since there is no recommendation for dosage for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination in these patient groups is avoided .
although a dosage adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl@@ engl@@ y@@ col@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated for inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhyth@@ ms ( z ) .
patients should be advised that a@@ generation or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ generation prevents the risk of 47 transmitt@@ ing HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Stand@@ ardi@@ zation R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available .
a@@ generation should be depos@@ ited in duration when a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and associated met@@ abolic disorders such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
in H@@ äm@@ oph@@ ila patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous perc@@ ut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ at@@ omas are present .
it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resulting in vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
508 % is increased , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the simultaneous consumption of as@@ ec@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead to adverse events associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , visual disturb@@ ances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
on the basis of data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution to the intake may not be applied due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ col in pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of l@@ act@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the in@@ filtration in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ generation was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of a@@ generation or another at the same time used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of disease .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated regim@@ en with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
the early departure of a fail@@ ing 60 therapy is recommended to stop the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ generation should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and lets the blood circulation in the tissue close to a large strengthening volume and an un@@ ob@@ stru@@ cted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed which point to a delayed development .

the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream lasts five times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream lasts five times a week for six weeks .
the cream is before bed@@ time thin layer to apply to the affected skin surfaces so that they remain sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before they are washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies in which the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo applied either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with n@@ ude Ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream can continue until all visible event war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ al area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if , after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she not@@ ices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and puri@@ fied in the puri@@ fied , infected skin area until the cream is fully incorporated .
there should be a reduction in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a reduction in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host@@ - reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ h@@ emp@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case were observed with one of the circumc@@ ision of leading stro@@ kes .
in case of an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local irrit@@ ation was observed , which made a treatment necessary and / or led to a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the end of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , requiring emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream directly following treatment with other cut@@ aneous properties for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ ic@@ ular area has not yet been found in clinical experience .
although limited data indicates an increased rate of inci@@ dence of inci@@ dence in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group regarding the elimination of wr@@ inkl@@ es .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair attachment has not been studied .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or reactions form after conclusion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the dis@@ comfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data available for long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other appropriate therapy forms should be considered in super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s there are no clinical experiences , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ak@@ tin@@ ess ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip area .
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ak@@ tin@@ ess ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and sc@@ alp .
the available data on the tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions normally decrease in the course of therapy intensity or go back after setting the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for a few days .
the data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons have a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not produce direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / f@@ og@@ tale development , release or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .

the most commonly used and possibly possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related adverse events in the trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions to the place of the treatment of the event war@@ ts ( 33.@@ 7 % of the patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and considered prob@@ able or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application place with an inci@@ dence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , possibly or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effect were in these studies a reaction to the application place ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects identified by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream were listed below .
the assessment of clinical evidence provided according to the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently came to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ k@@ ori@@ ation / off @-@ sc@@ u@@ ff ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ dem ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
this according to the test plan intended assessment of clinical signs indicates that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very frequently resulted in severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe scar@@ ring and enc@@ ru@@ sting ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials to investigate the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the act@@ ose ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the acci@@ dental unique oral recording of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , existed in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , system@@ ic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the genital war@@ ts over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
in 60 % of the 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , the bo@@ at@@ war@@ ms healed completely ; this was in case of 20 % of the 105 patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a total healing was achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI :

a minimal system@@ ic inclusion of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ gen 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 single bag ) , on the sc@@ alp ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after top@@ ical application to MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super @-@ targeted bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four month study on der@@ mal tox@@ icity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; a study carried out four months for der@@ mal application resulted in no similar effects during the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice with mal@@ ign@@ ant administration of three days a week induced no tum@@ ors at the site .
the mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od only has a low system@@ ic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk for the human being is considered very low due to system@@ ic exposure .
tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UV@@ R .
it can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If one of the listed side effects you significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
● F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ it@@ als ( sexual organs ) and anus ( anus ) ● surface bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma This is a common , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body .
if untreated , it may lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - hence early detection and treatment is important .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with backed diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( MP@@ S I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of the MP@@ S I can occur : enlarged li@@ vers , sti@@ ff joints , the movements ag@@ grav@@ ate , decreased pul@@ mon@@ ary volume , heart and eye disease .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other inherited met@@ abolic disorders .
administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alisation devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was examined mainly by the safety of the drug , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by examining its effects related to the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me sen@@ sed G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensitivity , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion area .
very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , Tach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may react strongly hyper@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other ingredients ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and if necessary update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me will monitor patients who receive al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in relation to the reactions to the inf@@ usion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. company for the import of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ alian cell cultures ( Chinese hamster ov@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese hamster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with backed diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other inherited met@@ abolic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage regim@@ en can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or h@@ ep@@ atic in@@ suffici@@ ency has not been determined , and for these patients no dosage regim@@ en can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be monitored closely , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting where re@@ vit@@ alisation devices are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when applying al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as little experience exists regarding the res@@ ump@@ tion of treatment after a longer break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity has to be handled with caution due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity .
60 minutes before the inf@@ usion begins with medications ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minim@@ ise the potential inci@@ dence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
in the case of mild or moderate inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be induced and / or a reduction in inf@@ usion rates to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought down , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
inf@@ usion can be res@@ um@@ ed with a reduction in inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as reduction in inf@@ usion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate , in which the pre @-@ balanced reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time using chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
animal @-@ experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect dam@@ aging effects on pregnancy that include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended to not breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment .
side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase @-@ 3 study and their prolong@@ ation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred in addition , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , breath @-@ still@@ s and facial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ e- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with mainly severe trial form and a duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients received a ser@@ o@@ conversion within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment , with a he@@ avier follow @-@ up form usually within one month compared to a ser@@ o@@ conversion ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 trial ( or up to a premature termination from the study ) no antibodies were detected by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ lac@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay , including 3 patients with whom it had never come to ser@@ o@@ con@@ ection .
patients with poor to low levels of antibody showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was detected .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ ginal to low @-@ neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vit@@ ro , which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the inci@@ dence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ates and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient re@@ establishment of enzyme activity .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ osom@@ es , most likely via man@@ ure @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which applied the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the average phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a forced exp@@ iratory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to function in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the anticipated percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the size of the children .
from the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG level in the urine ( µg / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in relation to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifest@@ ations between the patients , which were taken into account by using a combined final point , the clin@@ ically significant changes are summar@@ ised for five efficacy variable ( anticipated percentage of normal FE@@ V , range in the 6 @-@ minute test , range of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe decay form and 4 with middle course form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased because of increased Gag@@ - mirror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size @-@ growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found a normal mental development speed after the Z @-@ Score ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe trial form only limited or even no advances in cognitive development were detected .
in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me dosing regim@@ ens were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage diagram with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regim@@ ens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that in elderly and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in single @-@ time administration , tox@@ icity in repeated administration and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed under 6.@@ 6 .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not yet been treated before , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens .
to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is given together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin additionally a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicine against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) should be given .
in patients whose blood is changed , or when certain other side effects occur , treatment should be postpon@@ ed or reduced .
the active form of p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slo@@ ws the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form goes more easily into cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell C@@ ells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta had longer survival times than with the comparative drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission approved the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dis@@ sol@@ dered with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of necessary dosage is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is used in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with either lo@@ - , advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell car@@ cin@@ oma except for over@@ wie@@ w disk epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after conclusion of the pan@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid is required to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions on the day before and on the day of the p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed gift as well as on the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ mus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mcg ) a week before the first p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle .
in patients who receive p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood @-@ picture should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ in trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times of the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into consideration the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood balance or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are applied for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 Blood .
should patients not develop ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value prior to treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled , if in patients after 2 dose of dose the ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies do not give any indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , there is an increased side effect risk of patients aged 65 years or over .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min do not require dose adjustments that go beyond the dose calculations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ atine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver dysfunction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - mar@@ ginal value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ ital supp@@ ression and p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality rate again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - zy@@ t number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te speed and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ec@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity , such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was observed if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients with pan@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed need to be reli@@ ed on fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ - lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non@@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ ls@@ c ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and reduction 2 days after therapy with pan@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients for which a therapy with pan@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pan@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients who experienced these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events including dehy@@ dra@@ tion , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space should be considered drainage of the eff@@ usion before the p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment .
5 overwhelming cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials involving P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic active substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ versi@@ bly re@@ productive capacity of the re@@ productive capacity is made by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised in front of the treatment pe@@ w@@ ter to obtain advice on sperm conservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can lead to a decreased p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased inci@@ dence of side effects .
therefore , caution is advisable if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) are used to dose high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and reduction 2 days after treatment with pan@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should be avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data on the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long semi @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with pan@@ emet@@ ric acid .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as in case of an@@ de@@ - and an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should not be used during pregnancy except if necessarily - and after careful balancing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ versi@@ bly damage to the re@@ productive capacity is made by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised to consult with regard to the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .

ALI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ op@@ last@@ y anti@@ sep@@ tic that performs its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting important fol@@ lic @-@ dependent met@@ abolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vit@@ ro studies , P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed acts as anti@@ de@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ at@@ redu@@ ct@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ amide ri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , which are the follo@@ wer @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ os@@ yn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .

the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medicine ( random@@ ised and treated ) in the treatment arm .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clinical @-@ relevant symptoms ( p@@ ains and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown using the Lun@@ - genital symptom scale in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the all@@ some cis@@ pl@@ a- tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving the lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ central , random@@ ised , open Phase III trial with ALI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in Pati@@ ents with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC led medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat Pop@@ ulation n = 283 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months with patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on treatment effects on overall survival occurred in favor of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,@@ 018 ) .
limited data of a random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed are similar to P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the ALI@@ M@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination ALI@@ M@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1,15 ) , overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27,@@ 3 - 33.@@ 9 ) for the combination ALI@@ M@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of N@@ SC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in accordance with hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = Con@@ fi@@ dence interval ; IT@@ T = Int@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ sub@@ sist@@ ence limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 645 ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) .
patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin require fewer trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28,@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fusion ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te transfer ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green @-@ yellow , without compromising the quality .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take allergy and do not list weight after 12 weeks should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can &apos;t reduce some fats in the food , which causes about a quarter of the fats associated with the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 391 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg , after one year , had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with chair access , chair @-@ pull , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( com@@ part@@ es ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients who are treated with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( for preventing organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in preventing blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where insufficient nutrients are taken from the diges@@ tive tract ) or to cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
the European Commission granted approval to the company Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Limited in July 2007 for the placing of Or@@ list@@ at G@@ SK throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ or , low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i must not be applied to children and adol@@ escents under 18 because there is not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ b@@ ated , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Response time treatment with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Chol@@ ester@@ ase • pregnancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken along with a fat @-@ rich meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved met@@ abolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic must be adjusted .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or high cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contra@@ cep@@ tions in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in plasma is observed .
when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international standards ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a supple@@ mentary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a single @-@ mal@@ do@@ sis A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of healthy volunteers who at the same time received an or@@ list@@ at , observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and generally were light and temporary .
frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estim@@ able ) .
the inci@@ dence of known adverse events noted after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain magnit@@ ude .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days on normal and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported on the market launch , there were either no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid feedback of the system@@ ic effects that are attri@@ but@@ able to the li@@ f@@ inhibit@@ ory properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect begins in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bond to the active ser@@ ine @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ ischen and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at is taken three times daily , the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 determine the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ or , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of the random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of studies ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ est@@ erin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( max. rating 5,20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( starting point 3,30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
in the wa@@ ist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 in general , the met@@ abo@@ lic@@ ated or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of accumulation .
in a study involving obes@@ e patients , which was given the minimal system@@ ically res@@ or@@ b@@ ated dose , two main metabol@@ ites could be identified , M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ s@@ ated lac@@ t@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ cine group ) , representing nearly 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , kan@@ cin@@ ogenic potential and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans .

the most common side effects depend on the mode of action of the capsules and result in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , since at this time you may not have reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the nutritional phenomena : • Start a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a low @-@ fat diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite meals and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ eli@@ hood that you exceed your fat limit sink . • Use your recommended amount of fat ev@@ enly on your daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may consume per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Store medicines for children un@@ appro@@ achable . • You may not apply all@@ i after the expi@@ ration date indicated on the box . • Ke@@ ep the container ti@@ ghtly closed to protect contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed recep@@ tac@@ les with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

obes@@ ity has an effect on your health and increases the risk of the emergence of various serious diseases , such as : • Blu@@ th@@ och@@ pressure • Diabetes • Cardi@@ ac disease • stroke • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis talk to your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
sustained weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ jou@@ les , which you can also find in food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume a maximum per day .
keep in mind the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should consume with each meal .
what amount is appropriate for you , refer to the information below indicating the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Due to the capsule mode of action , compliance with recommended fats is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ eli@@ hood of nutritional defici@@ encies . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight incre@@ mentally and continuously about 0.5 kg per week , without developing fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low @-@ physical activity &quot; means that you spend a day in the garden or do other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you burn 150 kcal per day , e.g. through 3 km Walk , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and keep them . • Sinn@@ liche is a nutrition journal with information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you to feed cal@@ orie and fat @-@ indu@@ ces and give guidelines to become physically active .
in conjunction with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you to develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional administration of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug which can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , since the effects in this age group are not enough information .
this means that the agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no v@@ om@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission approved Bi@@ rex Pharmaceu@@ ticals Ltd . a permit for the acquisition of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with heavily em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to canc@@ ers and prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to canc@@ ers .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids given before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty hom@@ olog@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored eng@@ mes@@ hed after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is required at the simultaneous offering of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or who tend to have such an extension .
in addition to a further chemotherapy regim@@ en , Alo@@ xi should not be used for prevention and treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chemotherapy drugs studied against tum@@ ours ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ t@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interactions between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population based phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ k@@ ine@@ tic analysis , the simultaneous administration of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 indu@@ ctors ( am@@ eth@@ as@@ one , c@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions in the administration of administration ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage similar frequencies of adverse events appeared as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , however , due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy with a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg d@@ ag@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life time 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and dac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine , and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
following clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion@@ ic channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of intra@@ ven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
absorption After intra@@ ven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the total dose range of 0.@@ 7@@ 90 μ g / kg in gest@@ ures and cancer patients dose @-@ proportional .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) measured in 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular car@@ cin@@ oma patients was 42 ± 34 % between Day 1 and Day 5 .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the total tex@@ tual position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved at once in three consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to the value measured after one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was above 0.75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys , and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabolism , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
in vit@@ ro studies on metabolism have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found in the urine within 144 hours , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of joints , the total body temperature was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the termin@@ ale elimination of elimination and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only following ex@@ positions which are considered sufficiently beyond the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of pre @-@ clinical studies , indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion@@ ic channels , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ long the capacity of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately the 30@@ times of the therapeutic exposure of humans ) , which were given daily for over two years , led to an increased inci@@ dence of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , pit@@ u@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is a unique application for humans , the relevance of these results than for humans is low .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report recomm@@ ending the approval of the drug use Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ector solution intended for the treatment of h@@ epatitis C .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon was supposed to resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference doctor &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) h@@ epatitis C ( liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic examination the liver tissue damage damages , and the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ in- amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ normally are increased .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimul@@ ates this to the formation of the active ingredient .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data demonstrating the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and efficacy in h@@ epatitis C ) .
in the study of h@@ epatitis C patients the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference physician to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study showed how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was taken to the drug ( i.e. no symptoms of the virus indicated in the blood ) .

in addition , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be mark@@ eted will not suff@@ ice .
the number of h@@ epatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical trial .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease fl@@ amed more patients once more than with the reference physician ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
in addition to this , the test used in the study to investigate the question , to what extent the medication forms an immune response ( i.e. the body trains antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( crack or chi@@ ves ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been demon@@ stra@@ bly or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go may not work against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface to be treated should not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should re@@ examine the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om@@ es ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo responded to treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ unden , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ filled c@@ avi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a stimul@@ us at the site .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go predomin@@ ate in short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mes , abra@@ sions or stit@@ ched wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection began .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not supposed to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or wor@@ sen@@ ing of the infected place after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after top@@ ical use on moder@@ ately skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous offering of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on sc@@ ared skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive tox@@ icity after oral consumption and are insufficient regarding a statement regarding the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is to be preferred by the administration of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
if the breast@@ feeding continues / expi@@ red or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / stopped , the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy should be considered .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the site , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the effect mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ oms that differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the Bin@@ dungs@@ stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ dungs@@ stelle and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase@@ zentrum .
through binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line blocking the pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , partly block P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines in at least some infection forms seem question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
absorption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was taken daily under oc@@ cl@@ usion to intact and on sh@@ red@@ ded skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was carried out in days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medi@@ ation and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of people after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 off skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , less than CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id gland changes .
in vit@@ ro @-@ examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test respectively in cultures of human periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for In @-@ vi@@ vo @-@ examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 off skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study of rats , oral dosing of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 times of estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ icity ( reduced body weight of the fo@@ etus and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity was established .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and fifteen years that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ine existing from two doses , and a protection against h@@ epatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of h@@ epatitis B infection during the imm@@ uni@@ zation and is ensured that the vacc@@ ine from two doses can be led to an end .
if a refres@@ her dose is desired against h@@ epatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another Hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vacc@@ ine can be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the V@@ acc@@ ine Twin@@ rix Association approved since 1996 and has been the approved vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ine existing from three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for efficacy was the percentage of the vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vacc@@ ine was compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix performed between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody levels against h@@ epatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ tie at a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections was similar .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 vacc@@ ine doses ) are head@@ ache , appetite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may not be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 the European Commission granted the company Gl@@ ax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standard pri@@ ming plan for the pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two ino@@ cul@@ ation doses , with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ine .
the anti @-@ h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ HA@@ V anti @-@ HA@@ V ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ HA@@ V ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ HA@@ V ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody are the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have responded to a h@@ epatitis vacc@@ ination need to have a ch@@ ino@@ cul@@ ation as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , the possibility of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vacc@@ ine .
if a rapid protection against h@@ epatitis B is necessary , the standard pattern is recommended with the combination vacc@@ ine that contains 360 ELISA units of form al@@ in@@ inated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ b antibody levels following the pri@@ ming of the immune system , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ inations can be required .
since intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ mus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal impot@@ ence , these injection paths should be avoided .
in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can however be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneously , since it can result in bleeding after intra@@ mus@@ cular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influ@@ enza type b vacc@@ ine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ences , it is necessary to assume that there is no adequate immune response .
in a clinical trial which was carried out with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the inci@@ dence of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , fatigue , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the inci@@ dence observed in earlier Thi@@ omer@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vacc@@ ine formulation .
in clinical trials , a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations were given in a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations ranging from 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a calculation basis per V@@ acc@@ ine I@@ sis , but not based on a basis of calculation per person .
pain was observed at 5@@ 0,7 % of the subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine .
after the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix had over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ D combination vacc@@ ine .
however , the frequency of Mat@@ ernity was comparable to pro trial ( i.e. about the total ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and fatigue was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vacc@@ ine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study at 1 @-@ 11 year old vacc@@ ine , the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not pro trial , was reported .
the percentage of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with the combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELI@@ SA@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ converter rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose administered to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ konver@@ ter rates for Anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose administered to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted between 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vacc@@ ine with three doses .
in the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was worthwhile , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against h@@ epatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response obtained from a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses supplement scheme using Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses supplement with a combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELISA units of form al@@ in@@ inated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in those who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and Anti @-@ H@@ b antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vacc@@ ine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and Anti @-@ H@@ b antibodies reported 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme is compared to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .

the h@@ epatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food@@ stu@@ ffs and drinks , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in waters contaminated by wast@@ e@@ water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lo@@ wish ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against infection with h@@ epatitis B or h@@ epatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ine series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B virus before the administration of both vacc@@ inations ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of h@@ epatitis B or h@@ epatitis B infection cannot be convey@@ ed .
• If you already have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vacc@@ ine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ ching r@@ ashes , breathing difficulty or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • If you have already an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has .
• If you want to quickly protect h@@ epatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the regular dose of the second vacc@@ ine ) .
at a possible risk of infection with h@@ epatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined h@@ epatitis C / h@@ epatitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second ino@@ cul@@ ation dose of this vacc@@ ine with reduced content of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ine against ending the vacc@@ ine series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected to persons suffering from severe bleeding disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense / is or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response to these individuals on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction is on vacc@@ ination .
21 . tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines / takes ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / has received / has received immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vacc@@ ine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both h@@ epatitis A and B viruses .
if another vacc@@ ine needs to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as different as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine will still be sufficient .
usually Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breast@@ feeding women is not administered unless it is urg@@ ently needed to be vacc@@ inated against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B .
important information about certain components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data known since the first approval for placing on the market , CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , as Ambi@@ rix has been placed in traffic only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ is can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( loss of brain damage due to high am@@ mon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ ica is divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al son@@ de ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study , because Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ medicine , that is , without active substance ) .
am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to loss of appetite , a ab@@ normal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ainting , fluid retention , taste disturb@@ ances , or taste , stomach pain , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ ies in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle are effectively prevented from excessive am@@ mon@@ ia values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this drug was available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for the use if a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy is in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lo@@ wing disorders AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually with regard to the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for the growth and development .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adol@@ escents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early @-@ manifest@@ ed deficiency of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ atal syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered patients with swal@@ lo@@ wing disorders as a risk for the development of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a occurs when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be applied only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be applied only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) it came to a slo@@ wing of neur@@ onal propag@@ ation and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed emp@@ t@@ ying of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be established whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one und@@ esi@@ rable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ oc@@ op@@ enia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occ@@ ured in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms begin with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity in intra@@ ven@@ ous doses of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic compound which con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation of glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is eliminated by the kid@@ neys .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is put at an early stage and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of early @-@ manifest@@ ed form of the disease with the occurrence of first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was previously almost always inf@@ aust , and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nit@@ ro@@ genous an@@ alogues within the first year of life .
by means of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ine form of the Or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism , and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate have been detected .
following different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was detected after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis treated repeatedly with So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no cl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who do not have to swal@@ low any tablets or patients with swal@@ lo@@ wing disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al son@@ de .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ born babies , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adol@@ escents and adults .
the concentration of am@@ mon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be held within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early @-@ manifest@@ ed deficiency of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rats were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , there were l@@ esi@@ ons in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the brain rin@@ ds .
a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ oc@@ op@@ enia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ulate form 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected .
during the duration of durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not more than 25 ° C .
this procedure contains the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spo@@ on 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS may also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products which accum@@ ulate after eating proteins in the body .
if you are considering laboratory tests , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not use AM@@ MONA@@ PS because the medicine can pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturb@@ ances , hin@@ d@@ sight of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disturb@@ ances and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed .
if you determine one of these symptoms , please contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating a corresponding treatment .
if you forget the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose once as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood flow ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin odor , skin r@@ ash , kidney dysfunction , weight gain and an@@ om@@ ale laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may not use AM@@ MONA@@ PS after the expi@@ ration date stated on the box and the container &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Us@@ able up to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as AM@@ MONA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack of AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets are of white color and oval form , and they are provided with the em@@ bos@@ sing &quot; U@@ CY 500 . &quot;
30 If laboratory tests are performed , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs .
you should take AM@@ MONA@@ PS to the same single doses or@@ ally or via a gast@@ ric fi@@ ster ( hose that runs straight into the stomach through the abdominal wall ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Rem@@ ove from the container a he@@ aped measuring spo@@ on gran@@ ulate . • St@@ range a straight edge , e.g. a knife bridge over the top of the measuring spo@@ on to remove excess gran@@ ules . • The recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons gran@@ ules out of the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example with un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; St@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ aly measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox was compared to a single gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) compared to conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , patients often have a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new inci@@ dents ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or one year as well as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ went a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in regarding all indicators , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ine , other mil@@ let or other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd in September 2004 for the launch of An@@ gi@@ ox throughout the European Union .
to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non@@ - ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency interv@@ ene or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of 0,1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in further consequence , an additional pressure of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1,75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be res@@ um@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours following clinical requirements .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and one of these immediately following intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be eff@@ ected .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , re@@ constitu@@ tive and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis is quickly administered intra@@ ven@@ ously .
once the ACT decreases more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administered properly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) to undergo a PCI ( whether bi@@ valent with AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dosage of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is re@@ examined again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT was 5 minutes after the gift of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .

patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ valent in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant is administered ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even though most arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points in the case of PCI patients suffer from arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during treatment in principle throughout bleeding .
in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ valent studies , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Stand@@ ardi@@ zation ) should be considered to ensure that the value after de@@ composition of treatment with bi@@ valent degree is again achieved before treatment .
starting from the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation inhibit@@ ors ) , these agents may increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ valent studies with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation inhibit@@ ors or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ ost@@ asis parameters are regularly checked .
the animal @-@ experimental studies are insufficient in terms of effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , dis@@ infection or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n group and in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an A@@ cu@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of point , reduction of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ spi@@ eg@@ els of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known blood@@ stream , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages that occ@@ ured in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study with bi@@ valent studies in 6000 patients under@@ going a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n group and in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients .

the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after comprehensive application and are classified according to system categories in table 6 .
in the case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ valent udi@@ n can be stopped immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and at the an@@ ion binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or straight .
the binding of bi@@ valent udi@@ n to thro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because thro@@ mb@@ in is slowly spl@@ itting the binding of bi@@ val@@ ent@@ udi@@ n @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generates the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , with ser@@ um of patients with ser@@ um @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ine @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) was not indu@@ ctive .
in healthy subjects and in patients , bi@@ valent studies show a dosage and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect which is verified by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the patients below , an additional radius of 0.@@ 5mg / kg should be given and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the A@@ cu@@ ity study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adol@@ escents and children from six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thig@@ h or the upper arm inj@@ ected or administered as a permanent inf@@ usion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin can not work effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter active time than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in the case of type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot process insulin effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in the first study compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin tri@@ c@@ ages .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.30 % in human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin or one of the other ingredients , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for placing A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the thig@@ h or del@@ ta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion in the area of the abdominal wall .
due to the decreased glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin requirement in patients with a restriction of liver function can be reduced .
any change of the active strength , the brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of manufacturing can change the insulin requirement .
3 An insufficient dosage or failure of a treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another producer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the timing of the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active section of the used insulin and can therefore change when switching to the treatment regim@@ en .
to the substances that can increase blood sugar activity and increase prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias , oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , fi@@ br@@ ate , fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ regulation can be weak@@ ened or absent from the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine .
experimental studies on re@@ productive tox@@ icity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ins occur in human breast milk , but generally insulin does not enter into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it consumed after oral application .

Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is om@@ itted to continuously change the injection site within the injection range , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after glu@@ co@@ ag@@ onal injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episo@@ des .
insulin lo@@ wers blood sugar levels by stimulating the periph@@ eral glucose absorption ( especially due to skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) and the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with cou@@ - man@@ em standard insulin .
in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeutic relevant dosing area of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional amount of glu@@ cos@@ a @-@ lowering effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in glu@@ cos@@ ine effect , just like human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achiev@@ es the full glu@@ cos@@ ine effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was clear that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post @-@ den@@ oun@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached as with human regular insulin that is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ operative control was achieved than with human regular insulin that was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with human regular insulin , which is given 2 minutes before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) , is achieved .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at Gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ LI@@ SIN - before ) before the start of the meal in comparison to human regular insulin that was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human regular insulin that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at a time of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ LI@@ SIN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal in comparison to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
