<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Review Report (EPAR), in which the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) evaluates the studies carried out to make recommendations concerning the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please consult your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of enamel tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wiry thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things which are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a mental disorder where patients have a normal mood alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of disturbed restlessness or behavioural disorders when oral ingesting of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases the solution can be applied or the tablets can be used in patients with the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify should be removed, the Abilify dosage should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is believed to be a "partial agonist" for receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less dimensions than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin can play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing mental or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that were suffering from increased unrest over a period of two hours with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, in 160 patients with which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from disturbed restlessness, compared with which by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorbs the enamel tablets and the solution to the intake (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg cans were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled access), tremor (tremble), nausea (nausea), obstipation (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Drugs (CHMP) concluded that Abilify's benefits in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar-I-disorder as well as the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes addressed the treatment with Aripiprazole, predominate against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with multiple episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, predominate against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission approved the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for placing Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients displaying mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes addressed to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorder and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, transitions disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposing for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolmia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with Abilify are signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesia, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had patients treated with Aripiprazole, an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycaemia related adverse events in Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated patients who permit direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, Polyurie, Polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes Mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes Mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding a degradation of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania because of comorbidities, the application of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable if Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the resorption of aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites may result in common use with highly effective CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6 extensionsive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one considers the joint administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteaseinhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After lowering the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, Abilify dosage should be lifted to the dose at the outset of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 jointly administered with Abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethylan / 3-methoxymorphine-Ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of humans and due to the concerns raised in animal reproduction studies, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justifies clearly the potential risk of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including vehicles, to operate until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse reactions occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The incidence of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with aripiprazole, a total of lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14,8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients with ophthalmic therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Bipolar-I-Disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients with Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% was treated for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters, no medically significant differences were found.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole versus 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects related to antipsychotic therapy, and about their incidence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, spätdyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes Mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch unintentional or intentional overdosage with Aripiprazole was observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of overdose with Aripiprazole, however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing, since Aripiprazol has a high plasma protein.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is believed that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is communicated over the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor as well as an even affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">At the gift of Aripiprazole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks of healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependant reduction in the binding of 11C Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and at the putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled study, 52 of the responder patients who attended study mediation were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from the measurement scales defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- Depressionsadvise scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of decline, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and at 57% placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olantor-controlled, multi-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study 'weight gain' occurred, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder Aripiprazol showed a efficacy against placebo superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a efficacy of placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and an overall effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Also in week 12 Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania as Lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disturbance, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partially talked about 2 weeks not to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirror, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilizing phase before marginal stimulation, Aripiprazol prevailed against placebo in terms of preventing a bipolar return, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxydulation of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealkyung is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolisers via CYP2D6 and for approximately 146 hours with 'bad' (= "poor") metabolisers via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">Simulation-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics did not indicate clinically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose trial in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and kancinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects have only been observed in dosages or expositions that have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependant epidermis-toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3-10 times the mean Steady-State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose during the human race).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- metabolites in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean Steady-State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of sulfate conjugate found in the highest recommended daily dose of hydroxy- aripiprazole found in the highest recommended daily dose of hydroxy- aripiprazole found no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in Galle, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3- and 11-fold of the mean Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="143">Abilify injection solution is used to quickly control the Agitieredness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with multiple episodes of bipolar-I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="144">Once it is clinically appropriate, the treatment with Aripiprazol should be terminated and started with the oral application of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the absorption and minimise variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended under circumvention of obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used already for maintenance or acute therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the features of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify enamel tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution in patients with Agitieredness and behavioural disorders that have been caused differently than by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If a parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is additionally considered necessary for the Aripiprazol injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solutions are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, transitions disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposing for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolmia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding a degradation of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania because of comorbidities, the application of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of sedation was greater compared with the intramuscularly study in a healthy sample of Aripiprazole (15 mg dose), and the same time Lorazepam (2 mg dose) were intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the resorption of aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites, the common application with CYP2D6 extensioners can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol in higher plasma concentrations compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseinhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After lowering the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, Abilify dosage should be lifted to the dose at the outset of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that after all the gift of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were performed in clinical trials with Aripiprazol injection solution more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The incidence of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials involving orally applicable aripiprazole as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% was for patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters, no medically significant differences were found.</seg>
<seg id="169">Enhancements of CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole versus 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">To the side effects related to antipsychotic therapy, and about their incidence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, spellyskinesia and cramps, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioral disorders were the Aripiprazol injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements in Agitieredness / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 hours) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as Agitieredness and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant stronger improvement in the symptoms regarding the Agitieredness and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement of the baseline at the PANSS Excitement Component score in the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe Agitieredness, a similar effectiveness in relation to the overall population was observed, but a statistical significance could be determined based on a decreased patient count.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a Haloperidol-controlled study, 52 of the responder patients who attended study mediation were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from the measurement scales defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depressive rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the rate of decline was reported for Aripiprazol (oral), which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and at 57% placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olantor-controlled, multi-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' occurred, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which in part talked about 2 weeks not to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirror, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilizing phase before marginal stimulation, Aripiprazol prevailed against placebo in terms of preventing a bipolar return, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours according to intramuscular injection, the AUC is 90% bigger the AUC after the administration of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time was to reach the maximum plasma level in 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazol Injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys, resulting in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15- or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutical exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on the reproductive toxicity of intravenous application there were no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) about the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazol (oral) on safety-harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and kancinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans; therefore, they have limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependant epidermis-toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10-times the mean steady-state-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- metabolites in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81-times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was examined in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters previously had an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or as monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, in the main study 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If one considers only patients treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time, there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators, such as time and degradation of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It should also not be used in patients who breastfeed or have low neutrophils in the blood prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) found that Abraxane was not more effective in patients with which the first treatment was no longer more effective than conventional paclitaxel, and that in contrast to other Paclitaxel drugs should not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission approved the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the transport of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first-line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and is not shown for the treatment of standard anthracycline therapy (see also Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer) or severe sensorial neuropathy during Abraxane therapy the dose should be reduced in the following series to 220 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy grade 3, treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to Grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see section 4.4 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">There are no studies conducted with patients with impaired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data on recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with impairment of kidney function (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticulation formulation of paclitaxel, which could have essentially different pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should immediately be removed and a symptomatic treatment is initiated and the patient may not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no new Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrophils rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte speed rose to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunction (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">Whereas a clearly defined kardiotoxicity has not been proven in connection with Abraxane, cardiac incidents in the indicated patient collective are not unusual, especially in patients with early anthracycline treatment or underlying cardiac or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">In case of patients after the administration of Abraxane nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, they can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constipative means.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be applied in pregnant women or women in childbearing age that do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is unavoidable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraception method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane are advised to not bear a child during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperma conserved, since the therapy with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abrasives can cause side effects such as fatigue (very frequent) and dizziness (frequent) that can affect the traffic and ability to serve machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">Listed below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane once every three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported to 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed at 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>

<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubules drug which promotes the aggregation of microtubules from the tubes and stabilises the microtubules by inhibiting their deformation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin conveys the transference of plasma components into the endothelial cells and has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendotheliale transport is mediated by the gp-60-albumbi receptor and due to the albumming protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two randomized trials and from 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as 3-hour infusion with premedication for prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>

<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for the sound at baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmaceutical grade of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 g / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active substance exposure (AUC) increased from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or pasture binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel after intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane were compared with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearing of Paclitaxel was higher after Abraxane administration (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on human liver microsome and tissue histories, Paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma the mean value for cumulative urine secretion was 4% of the total dose, containing less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>

<seg id="361">Treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the drug is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron levels of all patients are checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the whole treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by a erythropoid deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby mitigate the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) was produced, enabling it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to a vein in a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">In all patients participating in this study, Eprex / Erypo had been injected into a vein at least eight weeks before they were either umumed to Abseamed or continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented results of a study in which the effects of abseamed under the skin were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were changed to Abseamed were upheld in the same degree as in those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which may occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, piercing migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that in accordance with the European Union regulations, the medicine has been proved that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>

<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Because of the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin values can occasionally be observed via or under the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value exceeds 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month or if the lasting hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be monitored engmeshed to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required for control of anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which the initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Initial dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with a dose of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and follow-up may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="397">The patients should be monitored engmeshed to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required to control anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the haemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the retikuloid numbers of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.E. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">When the haemoglobin increased &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the retikuloid number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline, the dose should be increased to 300 I.E. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the retikuloid number has increased ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If, on the other hand, the haemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) resides over &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline, a response to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with slight anaemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary intake of ≥ 4 blood convents is required, Abseamed should receive up to 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the Abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg of epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>

<seg id="410">Erythroblastlocia (PRCA) Very rarely reported on the occurrence of an antibody-based PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reverse cyte value should be determined and the usual causes for a non-contact (iron, folic acid, or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminiums toxication, infections or inflammations, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the retikulooocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the retikulozyten "index"), is degraded (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0,5%), which are determined by thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers, and if no other cause of an active loss is found, the anti-erythropotin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow for diagnosis of a PRCA should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk for anti-antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In case of chronic kidney failure, maintenance therapy should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 limit of haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefits attributed to the administration of epoetins when the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control anemia and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin rise should not exceed 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evidential coronary heart disease or insufficiency, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which is not yet dialysis, does not accelerate progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In case of tumour patients under chemotherapy, epoetin alfa should be considered a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response (patients who need to be transfused).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dosage must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapeutic anemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to apply recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk weighing under the participation of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are envisaged for a larger elective orthodontic procedure, if possible, prior to the beginning of epoetin-alfa therapy, the cause of anemia is examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a larger elective orthodontic procedure should receive adequate thromboseprophylaxis because they have an increased risk of osteootic and vascular diseases, especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that during treatment with epoetin alfa, an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events may exist in the treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial muscular level of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>

<seg id="428">Epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporindosis can be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues there is no evidence of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial imams, myocardial infarcts, cerebrovascular events (brain bleeding, brain infarction), intravenous thrombosis, arterial thrombolia, lung embolia, retinal thromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with Erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or deterioration of existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of the erythropoetin treatment, it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically obtained epoetin alfa is glycolic and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydrate share with the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of anemic patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown using cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates erythropoesis and does not affect leukopoesis.</seg>

<seg id="439">In the open study, there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and the control patients.</seg>
<seg id="440">In these studies, patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetic patients with anaemia were consistent with an unclarified, statistically significant higher mortality than in the controls.</seg>
<seg id="441">Overall survival in the studies could not be satisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thromboses and associated complications in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk of thromboemic events in tumour patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin, and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is not clear how far these results are applied to the use of recombinant human erythropoetin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transferring a haemoglobin value below 13 g / dl, as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data.</seg>
<seg id="444">Epoetin-alfa laws after repeated intravenous application showed a half-life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half-life of approximately 5 hours in patients with renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="445">After subcutaneous injection, epoetin alfa's serum levels are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="446">There is no accumulation: the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift.</seg>

<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of fractures in patients under Aclasta (without any other osteoporosis treatment) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without any other osteoporosis medication), the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fractures, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most Aclasta Overside effects occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonate or other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion point and osteoporosis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">Aclasta's producer provides educational material to physicians who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, as well as a similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should consult the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • for postmenopausal women • in men with an increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recently suffered traumatic hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg of Aclasta is once annually recommended.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low traumatic hip fractures the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fractures (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment with Aclasta, a long term of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget to ensure adequate intake of calcium, twice daily at least 500 mg of elemental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a very low traumatic hip fractures, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125.000 I.E. orinal or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta may be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal dysfunction (see Section 4.4) In patients with a creatine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, as data for the harmlessness and effectiveness are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Preexisting hypokalemia is to be treated with Aclasta before starting treatment with Aclasta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the rapid insertion of the effect of zoledronic acid on the bone structure, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia develops whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget to ensure adequate intake of calcium, twice daily at least 500 mg of elemental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="604">For patients who need dental surgery, no data is available, whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days of administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after application of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of adverse events reported by atrial fibrillation was increased in patients who received Aclasta (1,3%) (51 from 3,862) compared to patients who received placebo (0,6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), overall incidence of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction of zoledronic acid was associated with renal dysfunctions associated with renal renal function (i.e. an increase in serum-creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Kreatinin-Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited renal function were in a clinical study at osteoporosis over three years comparable to the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in the serum-creatinins within 10 days of the gift was observed at 1.8% of the patients treated with placebo versus 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2,10 mmol / l), showed up to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study on the prevention of osteoporosis after a hip fractures and in the Morbus Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently learned hip fractures, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of zoledronic acid in a large clinical study, local reactions to the infusion area, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteoporosis in the orthodontic area has been known primarily in cancer patients, over osteoporosis (primary in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonate, including cioledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interferences.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 studies with 7,736 patients showed osteoporosis in the jaw area in one with Aclasta and in a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of an overdose, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, an equation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconat.</seg>

<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric fractures Aclasta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta demonstrated a consistent lasting effect over three years resulting in a reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased the bone density at the lumbar vertebral acid, hip and distal radius, compared with placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.0%, the thigh around 5.2% and the distal radius of 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), one year after the third annual dose bone biopsies were taken from the pelvic sponge.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputertomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume compared to placebo in comparison to placebo, and the preservation of trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale Propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in sub-groups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclasta reduced BSAP significantly by 30% compared to baseline value and was kept at 28% below the initial value of 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value of 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value of 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125.000 I.E. littoral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Overall mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased the BMD compared to placebo treatment at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BMD by 5.4% on the total balance and 4.3% on the thigh.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study was randomized 508 men and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of Aclasta was not inferior to the percentage change in lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the Knochens Aclasta was examined in patients aged more than 30 years with radiologically confirmed, particularly light to moderate Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum mirror of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.7-fold age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledronic acid compared to intake of 30 mg Risedronate once daily for 2 months has been proven in two six-month comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain of pain was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six-month study (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 with Risedronate patients participating in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response at 141 patients with Aclasta, compared to 71 patients treated with Risedronat, could be maintained in an average duration of the follow-up phase of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledronic acid in 64 patients gave the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma bar decreased rapidly to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid bio-phase disappearance from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination peak time of ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution stages (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent the fast resorption in the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is independent of the dosage 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the zoledronic acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of metabolized substances by Cytochrome-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because zoledronylic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, metabolic inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the zoledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinine-Clearance, and was at the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50 - 80 ml / min) and moderate kidney dysfunctions down to a creatinine clearing up to 35 ml. / min does not require a dose adaptation of zoledronylic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for heavy kidney dysfunctions (Creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only restricted data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letally acting intravenous dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies on dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC were six times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Sub-chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was given in rats by administered intravenous infusion in 3-day intervals, in total 6 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7fold of the human-therapeutic exposure, referring to the AUC, equals), tolerated well.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated exposure to cumulated exposure positions, which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects with other organs including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common use in trials with repeated use was a multiply primary spongiosa in the metaphysics of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, an infestation that reflects the pharmacological, antiresorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats, one observed a teratogenicity of dosages from 0,2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was distinctive at 0.1 mg / kg due to the reduced serum calcium mirror.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Review Report (EPAR), in which it explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be applied to metformin in patients (particularly obese patients), which cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl rubber or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonyl resin and insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, whereby type 2 diabetes can be adjusted better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of actos in tripletherapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a decrease in HbA1c value, which suggests that blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triplet study, the effect of the additional administration of actos for existing treatment with metformin and sulfonyl resin in a decrease of HbA1c values decreased by 0.94% while the additional placebo injection led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin had been studied in 289 patients, patients who took Actos in addition to insulin have decreased HbA1c values of 0.069% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in the patients who also took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects related to Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may react hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other ingredients, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone mirror - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for the import of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white until whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the mark "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and where metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for patients under 18 years of age, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients affected by the presence at least one risk factor (e.g. heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease has been performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated liver cirrhosis (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror is increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be monitored as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms which point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper stomach problems, fatigue, appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical evaluation until the laboratory parameters are present.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, there was a slight reduction in the mean haemoglobin (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) under treatment with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 3.1-2% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral double or triple combination therapy with a sulfonic acid or dual combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch was reported under treatment with Thiazolidindian, including Pioglitazon, about occurrence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but orderly doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pioglitazone and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to receive a pregnancy or enter it, the treatment is to be cancelled (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not perform relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous application of pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in the AUC of pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the maternity unit decreases and thereby decreases the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 1000; &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not estimated from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT ascents above three times the upper limit of the normal range also frequently appeared as under placebo, but less rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease the incidence of severe heart failure in pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo when pioglitazone resides.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch has rarely been reported on congestive heart failure in Pioglitazon, however, if Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients were performed in the groups treated with comparision medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive Study period spanning over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5,1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparision medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon appears to act on activating specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome proliferator) activated by reeptor-γ (PPAR-γ), which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucosine production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilisation in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazide as monotherapy has been conducted over two years to examine the time until after the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the treatment commenced, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) was maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin was randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients suffering from pioglitazone the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients showed a statistically significant decrease in clinical studies over a year.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small examination of type 2 diabetics in a small, 18-week study.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction of overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as slight, but clinically non-significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced overall plasticglycerides and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol level over a period of up to two years.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under pioglitazon whereas values were observed under Metformin and Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both in effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and present advanced macrovascular disease were randomized to receive either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is quickly absorbed, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the efficacy in roughly three times the effectiveness of pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimally pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it could be proven that Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous application of pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 / inductor) or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive marketed Pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the waste (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma elimination period of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and all active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearing of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys were in accordance with repeated administration plasma volume augmentation with hemodilution, anemia and reversible excentric coronary hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the maternity unit decreases and thereby decreases the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumours (male rats) were induced by the urethra epithelium.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="825">Another study of two years has investigated the effects of a combination therapy of metformin, each with pioglitazone or gliolitazone.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical trials for more than 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both in effect on the tryglyceride absorption and hepatic Tryglizeride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of total mortality, non-fatal Myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary reascularization and reascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of pioglitazone there are no cardiovascular long-time risks associated.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane has been studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas can not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, where the body is unable to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c spegels suggesting that blood sugar levels were significantly reduced like with another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package case).</seg>

<seg id="1277">To avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronat and Vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union, the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE regarding increasing the vitamin D level.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who only recorded Alendronat (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also stipulates that the Alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pains of musculoskeletal (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of digestive apparatuses such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), ulcer (ulcera) of esophagus, dysphagia (swallowing), suction-driven abdomen, as well as saures.</seg>

<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all the signs and symptoms that indicate possible malophageal responses, and patients should be advised to suspend symptoms of malophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or wormble heartburn, and take medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious malophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who are not taking the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms pointing to malignant irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplant was rejected after a year of treatment (for example investigating how often a renewed organ transplant or a resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, more recent studies have been conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and investigates how Advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this may lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adaptation must be performed to ensure that systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in the individual case and on blood-level measurements (see below "Recommendations"</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the tacrolimus levels should be checked before switching over and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate post-transplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, an adaptation of the Advagraf Dosisschemas can last several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustment can be required later, since pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of the patient after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplantation prophylaxis of the transplant repulsion The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf Must must be converted a Transplant Receiver of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraf, so this conversion has to be done in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressants to Advagraf once a day, the treatment with the oral initialdosis recommended in kidney and liver transplantation must begin for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation In adult patients who are converted to advent, an oral initialdosis of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant receptors although there are no clinical experience with advan-, pankreas- and bowel-transplanted patients, came into an oral initialdosis of 0,15 mg / kg / day, in pankreastransplantes in an oral initialdose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in case of intestinal transplant receptors in an oral initial dose of 0,3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintaining blood levels in the targeted area may be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction a reduction of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dose adaptation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum Creatine inspiegel, a calculation of the creatininincts and a monitoring of the urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin- to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations for the blood level in the whole blood The dose should primarily stem from the clinical evaluation of repulsion and tolerability in the individual case with the aid of thoroughbred-tacrolimus-tallow controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform common controls of tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplant followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-blood levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to Advagraf, dosage adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or while applying substances which could alter the tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advagraf is a drug with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the perspiration of tacrolimus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplantation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant receptors, blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has resulted in serious adverse events including transplant repulsions or other side effects which may occur in consequence of tacrolimus or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes in the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be treated with other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retardated formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant receptors and graft recipients in childhood, there are still no clinical data for the retardated formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions, which can lead to a degradation of the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements, the Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum), is to be avoided or other plant enhancers during treatment with advanate (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood is offered, as the tacrolimus levels may be subject to significant fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, it was possible to observe a chamber or septum hypertrophy described as cardiomyopathy, which can therefore occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease, treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid pollution and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, the exposure of sunlight or ultraviolet light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a solar protection device with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES like headache, altered states of consciousness, convulsions and visual disturbances, should have a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advances contain hard capsules, retardose, lactose, special caution is recommended in patients with the rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-Galactose-malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">Simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or lower blood levels of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the tacrolimus- blood levels while taking substances that can change the metabolism of the CYP3A and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain consistent concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was treated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole and with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the rise in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-dose prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus can be metabolized by CYP3A4 whose metabolism impair.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormonal exposure, it is particularly cautious when decisions regarding contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal tests have shown that tacrolimus potentially lessen the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and can prolong their half-life time.</seg>

<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high connection to erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it is assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects On the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus may be conveyed by its binding to a cytosolenic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cellular nucleus.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematodes and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound faction of tacrolimus or a reinforcement of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, with excretion primarily via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in stable patients (twice a day) on Advagraf (once daily) in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg).</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether Advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII-lack, which causes blood clots like bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but produced by a method known as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) was introduced, enabling it to form the human scent factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union named Recombinate, similar but is produced differently so that the medicine contains no proteins or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the drug to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of Advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood sepsis with "excellent" and "good" was assessed.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advent may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">"" "" "" "in March 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Baxter AG for the launch of Advate in the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, according to the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity during the corresponding period does not sink under the given plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injections every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment process, a proper determination of the factor VIII-plasma is recommended to control the dose and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in response to factor VIII, varying in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-time periods.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A doses should be given between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-plasma activities are not achieved, or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII-therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The appointment speed should depend on the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII is a well known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTP) with more than 100 exposure times and anamnesia-known inhibitors development, after conversion from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the reoccurring of (lowest) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences over the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), which had a higher risk of the formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>

<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues that bind other structures in the body, surrounds and supports) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been altered in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus trigger no infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advocates would have been injected directly into the tumors, enabling cancer cells to rebuild the normal p53 protein again.</seg>

<seg id="1648">After CHMP checked the answers of the company to the questions asked him, there were still some questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumours brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programs with advexin.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways) in patients with nasal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that is to be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucous membrane (clogged nose), are cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be relocated to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effect dimensions were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the trial patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, patients reported that they took a decrease in symptoms of 46.0% compared to 35.9% in the patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients in Aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took the desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycarts, mouth-dryness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, anti-adrenergic active agents or loratadine (another drug for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow-angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hyperthyrophysis), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyroid hyperthyroid) or a haemorrhagic stroke (stroke caused by brain bleeding) or have a risk of a hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">"" "" "" "on 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of Aerinaèze throughout the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to swallow the whole (i.e. without shredding, to break or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on the harmlessness and effectiveness (see Section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not continue after the symptoms of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days since long-term use can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After a decrease in the swelling of mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued with Desloratadin as monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after the treatment has ended.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to the alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergoid, cergoergotamine, gihydroergotamine, or other decongestion, which can be attributed to peroral or nasal (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetacolin, naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data is insufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythms, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches) must be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck reconstruction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing the matological tests, as antihistamines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with Desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole was additionally given, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with the diloratadine and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether it was taken by the loratadine alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinalance during pregnancy is not assured, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to incidence in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstriction characteristics of pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a disease that can lead to impairment of the traffic or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS-stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible Latvian trials.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult mition, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, pachycardia, pain, depressions, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A ZNS-stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth-dryness, pupil-rigid and - dilatation, skin comfort, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include the inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokines like IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles and the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion-smolecule P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose trial with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gliding including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was observed in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestation of a ZNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years participated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher compared to the overall cores for the symptoms (except nasal mucous swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucous swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin about the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets did not show significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following the peroral application of healthy volunteers for 14 days, the flow equilibrium of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on Day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multidisciplinary study conducted with the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects, it was noted that four subjects of Desloratadin are poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was for exposure to the gift of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, however, the preclinical data with Desloratadin cannot detect any special hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin was very rare about cases of severe allergic reactions (breathing difficulty, whistling breath, itching, nettle rash and swelling) or rashes.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chase, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, sleep disorders, muscle pains, cramps, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspicuous liver values have also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 Mg- and 5 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml-solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by investigating the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of squares, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six-week treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to the intake and the enamel tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were considered, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius led to an average decrease in symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32%, compared to decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urticaria the decrease in symptom scores was six-week treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Desloratadine, Loratadine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted approval to the company SP Europe for the use of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of desloratadine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should take place according to the present disease progression and can be stopped after the end of symptoms and regresonate when reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persisting allergic rhinitis (occurence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole was additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can be accepted, which can lead to impairment of the traffic or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius, than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common side effects reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), mouth-dryness (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 youthful patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect headache was the most common side effect, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with Desloratadin and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose trial, at which up to 45 mg of desloratadine (nine-fold clinical dose) were given, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokines like IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles and the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion-smolecule P-selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical trial with multiple doses, in which desloratadine was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadine was administered in a dose of 45 mg. a day (the Neunfold of the clinical dose) over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval showed itself.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose trial with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gliding including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be classified as dependent on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall cores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively diminishes the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined representative for further forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology, despite the etiology, is similar in different forms and chronic patients can be recruited more easily.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As the histamine replacement is a causal factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that Desloratadin will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of the Urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reduction of size and number of spindles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadine compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and waxing significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale to assess these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients-demos were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, a higher concentration of desloratadine was achieved in 4% of patients.</seg>

<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, detects the human body as a body's foreign), was cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution to the intake, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked out which antiviral drugs the patient has taken before, and the likelihood of the virus will respond to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, which together with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of ageneration is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase decreases in combination with other antiviral medicines the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases related to AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with proteasinhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase increased with low-dose Ritonavir was compared with 206 adults, formerly known as protease inhibitors, compared with other proteasinhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had no protease inhibitors after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / mL than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also decreased the viral load, but only very few were treated to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the medicine increased with Ritonavir Agenerase the viral load after 16-week treatment as well as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase, along with Ritonavir, came to a stronger decline in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of ageneration (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), nausea (nausea), nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients who have Johanniskraut (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines, which are degraded in the same way as asecase and are injurious in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take ageneration are the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoporosis (death of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of ageneration in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmakokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefits of ageneration in combination with Ritonavir in patients who did not have a protease inhibitor are not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "", "since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the transport of ageneration in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitors (PI) pretreated adults and children aged 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be administered to the pharmacokinetic boosting of amprenavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient's pre-treatment (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amprenavir twice daily together with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (boosting), higher doses of asecase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of ageneration in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors have not been studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data for the harmlessness and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase should not be given simultaneously with medicines which possess a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450 IsoEnzymes 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations that contain Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a decreased therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that asecase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with ageneration prevents the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, aspecase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral therapy have increased risk of liver side effects with potentially fatal progression.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with reduced liver function including a chronic-active hepatitis show increased incidence of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with Fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that can be metabolised via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and suppression of the side kidney function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Standardization Ratio), methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, ageneration may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be changed, however, the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on oppiate symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylenglycolgehalts of the Agenerase solution, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Ageneration should be reduced in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases that were needed to treat medicines that are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors such as lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In Hämophila patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous percutaneous hematomas and hematomas are present.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defences, an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral therapy (ART), leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher Body-Mass Index), cases of osteoporosis in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic latitude are not allowed at the same time with drugs that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450 IsoEnzymes 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with a low therapeutic width of Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be combined with drugs whose agents are confused predominantly through CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that rifampicin causes a 82% decrease in the AUC of amprenavir resulting in virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, undesirable effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be humiliated by the simultaneous application of plant preparations with Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes Johanniskraut, the amprenate mirrors and, if possible, check the virus load and suspend the Johanniskraut.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% is increased, for CMAx reduced by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amprenavir twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily used to demonstrate the efficacy and harmlessness of this treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% degraded when amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) was given.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin-values of amprenavir in plasma which were achieved in combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with calcium (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of amprenavir and caletra can not be given, but a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out for use of ageneration in combination with Didanosin, but due to the antacid component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenue of Didanosin and Agenerase differ at least one hour (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adaptation is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with amprenavir in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other protease inhibitors and available limited data suggest that Nevirapin might lowers the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used at the same time, caution is advisable, because delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made since an accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended at least half of the recommended dosage, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with ageneration in combination with erythromycin have not been performed, however the plasma bars of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2,69fold compared to the value which was observed once a day without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can possibly lead to interactions with ageneration.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions linked to these drugs if they are used in combination with ageneration.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data from other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids should not be taken at the same time as asecase since it can cause resorption.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulsants known as enzyme ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipin, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nicedipine, nifedipine, nicedipine, nifedipine, nicedipine, nifedipine, nicedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous consumption of Agenerase can significantly increase its plasma concentrations and strengthen with PDE5 inhibitors associated with side effects including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the Fluticasonpropionate deposits increased significantly while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% exposure interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of ageneration with Ritonavir is not recommended along with this glucocorticoid, unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are expected to expect pronounced increases in plasma bars while simultaneously administration of ageneration.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma-level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors lead to Myopathy including a rhdomyolysis, the combined application of this drug with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations is recommended as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased at the same time by amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, ageneration should not be applied together with orally taken Midazolam (see Section 4.3) while with simultaneous use of ageneration with parenteral midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseinhibitors point to a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam around the 3- to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on oppiate symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given at the moment, as amprenavir is to be adjusted at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In the simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, an increased control of the INR (International normalised ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore also alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time by Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may be used only after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactating rats, amprenavir-related substances have been proven, but it is not known whether amprenavir is transferred to breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the infiltration in the uterus to the end of the breastfeeding of amprenavir, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the descendants, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of ageneration was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most adverse events associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, coming up early and rarely led to the outbreak of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of ageneration or another at the same time used for HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the adverse events listed below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which previously untreated patients received 1200 mg of ageneration twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study mediation and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (podystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and isolated fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated persons treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine for a mean period of 36 weeks, only one case (stacks) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, in 245 NRTI- pretreated patients under amprenavir 7 cases (3%) were found in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapular nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to break the treatment with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoporosis cases were particularly reported in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term use of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In case of HIV-infected patients with a severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of ageneration twice a day together with low-dose Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), species and incidence of side effects (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; an exception was increased increases in triglyceride and CPK values, which were treated very frequently in patients who received Agenerase along with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8), if necessary, necessary supportive measures can be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protease and thus prevents the process of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyproteinvorstages with the result of a formation of unripe, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB has been studied in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% protein concentration (IC50) of amprenavir lies in the range from 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronic infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of the HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir doses - as with other Ritonavir treated regimen with proteaseinhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-treated patients who received 700mg Fosamprenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be studied genotypically.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolates from 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients, with protease inhibitors not previously treated, showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33Q, M36I, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and their extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day: n = 107) in patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance testing based analyses of genotypical interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, L33F, M36I, I54A / L / F / G, I84V and L90M in combination with an increased phenotypical resistance to Fosamprenavir and a reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always bring the current interpretation systems to analyse the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic resistance testing based analyses clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with the genotypic data for estimating the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (isolating points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret results of resistance testing.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic samples creates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between amprenavir and other proteasing inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-treated patients with which a Fosamprenavir (one of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 insulators), Saquinavir (three out of 24 insulators) and Tifliavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 insulators).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, amprenavir retains its activity against some other proteasinhibitors-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to stop the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits which can adversely affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The receipt of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which with PI previously treated adults (600 mg twice daily) and Nukleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to ageneration, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the part study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-supremacy of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-adjusted AAUCMB group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subsistence threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The receipt of the effectiveness of unbiased Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>

<seg id="2044">508% increased, for CMAx reduced by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore minimal concentration in the Steady-State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage share of the free active ingredient varies throughout the dosing interval, depending on the overall drug concentration in the Steady-State over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 should be administered with care if they are given at the same time with ageneration (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposition like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is made from solution 14% less bio-bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, renal clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, so the effect of renal dysfunction should be low to the elimination of amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amprenavir plasma mirrors comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir twice a day without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on cannulity with amprenavir mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas occurred in male animals, which were to the 2.0 times (mice) or 3.8- times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>

<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposition, which was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed which point to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are used without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (boosting), higher doses of asecase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2078">In the simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, an increased control of the INR (International normalised ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg Ethinylestradiol plus 1,0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin by amprenavir by 22% or respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2187">Imiquimod cream is applied in a thin layer and purified in the purified, infected skin area until the cream is fully incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="2188">There should be a reduction in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with Imiquimod and the risk associated with a possible worsening of their autoimmune disease.</seg>
<seg id="2189">There should be a reduction in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with Imiquimod and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or graft versus host- reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2190">In other studies, in which no daily pre-hempygiene was performed, two cases of severe phimosis and a case were observed with one of the circumcision of leading strokes.</seg>
<seg id="2191">In case of an application of Imiquimod cream in higher than the recommended doses, there is an increased risk of severe local irritation (see Section 4.2.) In rare cases, severe local irritation was observed, which made a treatment necessary and / or led to a temporary physical impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occurred at the end of the urethra, some women had difficulty passing urine, requiring emergency catheterisation and treatment of the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The use of imiquimod cream directly following treatment with other cutaneous properties for the treatment of external genital warts in the genital and pericular area has not yet been found in clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Although limited data indicates an increased rate of incidence of incidence in HIV positive patients, Imiquimod cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group regarding the elimination of wrinkles.</seg>
<seg id="2195">The treatment of basal cell carcinoma with Imiquimod within 1 cm around the eyelids, nose, lips, or hair attachment has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are frequent, but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or reactions form after conclusion of treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of the local skin reactions, a treatment can be made of several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since there are currently no data available for long-term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment, other appropriate therapy forms should be considered in superficial basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs there are no clinical experiences, therefore the application is not recommended in pre-treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is a lower probability of response to Imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not examined for the treatment of aktiness keratosis on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip area.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the application of imiquimod for the treatment of aktiness keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the tinic keratose on the forearms and hands support the effectiveness in this application, therefore such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions normally decrease in the course of therapy intensity or go back after setting the therapy with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">The data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 ac- lesions have a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties Imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies do not produce direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fogtale development, release or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although neither according to one-time or more topical application, quantified levels of serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were achieved, no recommendation can be given during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly used and possibly possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream in related adverse events in the trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions to the place of the treatment of the event warts (33.7% of the patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and considered probable or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod cream related side effects include complaints at the application place with an incidence of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The patients treated by 185 with Imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, possibly or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod cream related side effect were in these studies a reaction to the application place (22% of the patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects identified by 252 in placebo-controlled phase III clinical trials with Imiquimod cream were listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The assessment of clinical evidence provided according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical studies with Imiquimod cream frequently came to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), exkoriation / off-scuff (23%) and Ödem (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This according to the test plan intended assessment of clinical signs indicates that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream very frequently resulted in severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and to severe scarring and encrusting (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials to investigate the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of the actose keratosis, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental unique oral recording of 200 mg imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, existed in hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic examination, systemic concentrations of alpha-interferons and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the genital warts over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the 119 patients treated with Imiquimodine, the boatwarms healed completely; this was in case of 20% of the 105 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A total healing was achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with imiquimodine, compared to 5% of 161 patients treated with placebo (95% CI:</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimodine in five malignant use per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary super fizial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all patients treated clinically were clinically cured and remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimodine in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four week interval, was examined in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic active lesions within a coherent 25 cm2 treatment area on the unha scalp or in the face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinically healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications are external boatwarts, acupuncture and super-fizial basal cell carcinoma do not usually occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimodine could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic inclusion of the 5% imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinent keratosis was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and betrugen 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face (12.5 mg, 1 single bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the two-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of Imiquimodine after topical application to MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with aktinic keratosis or super-targeted basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four month study on dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased Milz weight; a study carried out four months for dermal application resulted in no similar effects during the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice with malignant administration of three days a week induced no tumors at the site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod only has a low systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mutagenic, a risk for the human being is considered very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active cream, earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − If one of the listed side effects you significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Feigwarts (Condylomata acuminata) formed on the skin in the area of genitals (sexual organs) and anus (anus) ● surface basal cell carcinoma This is a common, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If untreated, it may lead to distortions, especially in the face - hence early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Nuts are harsh parts of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to sunlight during their previous lives.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be used for flat actuators in the face and on the scalp in patients with a healthy immune system, where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most suitable treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara Creme supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body combat superficial basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis, or the virus responsible for infection with genital warts.</seg>

<seg id="2251">If this daily cleaning is not performed under the foreskin, it can be calculated with increased incidence of skin injuries, fertilizers of the skin or difficulties when pulling the foreskin.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Apply Aldara cream not in the urethra (urethra), in the vagina (vagina), the cervix (cervix) or within the anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">Taking other medicines to have serious problems with your immune system should you use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have sexual intercourse with genital warts in the genital area, treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not previously) perform.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently applied, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Breastfeed your baby during the treatment with Aldara cream, since it is not known whether imiquimod enters into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of boatwarts, basal cell carcinoma and aktinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream on the clean, dry skin place with the fold warts and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully wrapped.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with genital warts under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin everyday and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2 "What must you consider before applying Aldara cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">A sufficient amount of Aldara cream is applied for 6 weeks each week to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>
<seg id="2262">Common side effects (expected to be expected in more than 1 of 10 patients) adverse events (in less than 1 of 100 patients expect) rare side effects (with less than 1 of 1,000 patients expected) Very rare side effects (with less than 1 of 10,000 patients expected)</seg>
<seg id="2263">Tell your doctor / pharmacist or pharmacist immediately if you do not feel comfortable during the application of Aldara cream.</seg>
<seg id="2264">If your skin reacts to the treatment with Aldara cream, you should not continue using the cream, wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or your pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells may make you more susceptible to infection; it can cause you to create a blue spot sooner or it can cause deposition.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Inform your doctor or pharmacist if one of the listed side effects you significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas on which you have applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions that resonate in approximately 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes at the application place (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, scorching, skin cells, bubbles, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes at the application place (blood, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen areas in the skin, tingling, discomfort or discomfort), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, inflammation of the eye lids, throat, facial swelling, ulcers, limb pain, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with backed diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged livers, stiff joints, the movements aggravate, decreased pulmonary volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalisation devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was examined mainly by the safety of the drug, but it was also measured by its effectiveness (by examining its effects related to the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme sensed GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Alduracyme in patients aged over five years (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensitivity, fever and reactions to the infusion area.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), Tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may react strongly hypersensitively (allergic) to Laronidase or any of the other ingredients (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known, and if necessary update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Alduracyme will monitor patients who receive alduracyms in relation to the reactions to the infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval to the Genzyme Europe B.V. company for the import of alduracyms throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster ovvary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with backed diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient tolerates this, increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Alduracyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage regimen can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of alduracyms in patients with kidney or hepatic insufficiency has not been determined, and for these patients no dosage regimen can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Alduracyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be monitored closely, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting where revitalisation devices are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that nearly all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reactions must be treated with caution when applying aldurazyms (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience exists regarding the resumption of treatment after a longer break, the risk of hypersensitivity has to be handled with caution due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the infusion begins with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimise the potential incidence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the case of mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be induced and / or a reduction in infusion rates to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought down, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as reduction in infusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, in which the pre-balanced reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used at the same time using chloroquine or procaine because a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of Laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal-experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy that include embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data on newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended to not breastfeed with Aldurazyme during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase-3 study and their prolongation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table following the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred in addition, including bronchospasm, breath-stills and facial oils (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a Phase- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years, with mainly severe trial form and a duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients received a seroconversion within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment, with a heavier follow-up form usually within one month compared to a seroconversion (average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 trial (or up to a premature termination from the study) no antibodies were detected by radioimmunoplacitation (RIP) assay, including 3 patients with whom it had never come to seroconection.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with poor to low levels of antibody showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was detected.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low-neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic Laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrates and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient reestablishment of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via manure-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Alduracyme were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase-3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which applied the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were from the average phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited when they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Alduracyme for another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Alduracyme showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to function in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the anticipated percentage FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the size of the children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">From the 26 patients with a hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease in the GAG level in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinine) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In relation to the heterogeneous disease manifestations between the patients, which were taken into account by using a combined final point, the clinically significant changes are summarised for five efficacy variable (anticipated percentage of normal FEV, range in the 6-minute test, range of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Alduracyme were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe decay form and 4 with middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased because of increased Gag- mirror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size-growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) found a normal mental development speed after the Z-Score (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe trial form only limited or even no advances in cognitive development were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase-4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various alduracyme dosing regimens were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, liver volume and the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage diagram with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a justifiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that in elderly and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity in single-time administration, toxicity in repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular hazards for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (medicines for cancer) and "malignant" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not yet been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regimens.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid and folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is given together with cisplatin, before or after the administration of cisplatin additionally a "anti-emetic" (medicine against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a lack of fluid) should be given.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood is changed, or when certain other side effects occur, treatment should be postponed or reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrexed thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed into its active form goes more easily into cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant Pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin had an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which the cancer did not attack the squamous cell Cells during the administration of Alimta had longer survival times than with the comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission approved the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the placing of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each piercing bottle must be dissoldered with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride-solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of necessary dosage is taken from the piercing bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is used in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with either lo-, advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma except for overwiew disk epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) administered intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after conclusion of the panemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small bronchial carcinoma following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">A corticosteroid is required to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions on the day before and on the day of the pemetrexed gift as well as on the day after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) a week before the first pemetrexed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive pemetrexed, a complete blood-picture should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate-transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times of the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place taking into consideration the Nadir of the blood balance or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3 which are applied for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 Blood.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop haematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient has the value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled, if in patients after 2 dose of dose the haematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so- on the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies do not give any indication that in patients aged 65 years or above, there is an increased side effect risk of patients aged 65 years or over.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials patients with a creatinin clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min do not require dose adjustments that go beyond the dose calculations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver dysfunction of &gt; 1.5-fold of the upper bilirubin- marginal value and / or transaminase values (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-times of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone marital suppression and pemetrexed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutrality rate again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- zyt number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose-reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte speed and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as observed in the previous treatment cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hematological and nichthecmatological toxicity, such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients with panemetrexed need to be relied on folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophy- lactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous use of nonsteroidal antiphlogistics (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cylsc (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and reduction 2 days after therapy with panemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for which a therapy with panemetrexed must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with panemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients who experienced these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space should be considered drainage of the effusion before the pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 overwhelming cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials involving Pemetrexed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversibly reproductive capacity of the reproductive capacity is made by Pemetrexed, men should be advised in front of the treatment pewter to obtain advice on sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid can lead to a decreased pemetrexed excretion with the result of increased incidence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advisable if patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) are used to dose high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and reduction 2 days after treatment with panemetrexed should be avoided (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data on the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long semi-life like Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with panemetric acid.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased frequency of INR (International normalised ratio) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as in case of ande- and antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy except if necessarily - and after careful balancing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversibly damage to the reproductive capacity is made by Pemetrexed, men should be advised to consult with regard to the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetrexed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed infant cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the incidence and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with Mesothelioma and the randomized cisplatin and pemetrexed, and 163 patients with Mesothelioma who were randomized cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Side effects Frequency indications: very common (≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000) and not known (based on the data available from spontaneous reports).</seg>

<seg id="2430">Cases of radiotherapy in patients were reported before, during or after their pemetrexed therapy were irradiated (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplasty antiseptic that performs its effect by interrupting important follic-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies, Pemetrexed acts as antideate with several points of attack by blocking the thymidylatsynthase (TS), Dihydrofolatreductase (DHFR) and glycinamide ribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are the follower-dependent key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomised, simple-blind Phase 3 study by ALIMTA plus cisplatin for cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant Pleuramesothelioma showed that with ALIMTA and cisplatin patients had clinically significant advantage of a median 2.8-month prolonged survival compared to those patients who were treated only with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received the investigational medicine (randomised and treated) in the treatment arm.</seg>

<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal and depend on the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and generally were light and temporary.</seg>

<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of the randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of studies (Table 1) and as a proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months.</seg>

<seg id="2542">In the waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of not metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 in general, the metabolicated orlistat in the plasma could be sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study involving obese patients, which was given the minimal systemically resorbated dose, two main metabolites could be identified, M1 (in position 4 hydrolysated lactring) and M3 (M1 after separation of N-Formyl leucine group), representing nearly 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting with heavily emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancers and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancers.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon massage, patients with anamnesty homologation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be monitored engmeshed after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is required at the simultaneous offering of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT interval is extended or who tend to have such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to a further chemotherapy regimen, Aloxi should not be used for prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapy drugs studied against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyttarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interactions between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady-state- concentration oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population based pharmakokinetic analysis, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (amethasone, cimetidine, chlorpromazine, fluoxetine, chinidine, chinidine, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for using Palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly associated with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions in the administration of administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage similar frequencies of adverse events appeared as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, however, due to the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably not effective therapy with a Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg dagasetron (half-life time 7.3 hours) were given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine, and 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Following clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ionic channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of intravenous Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Absorption After intravenous gift follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional to the total dose range of 0.790 μ g / kg in gestures and cancer patients dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous injection of palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) measured in 11 testicular carcinoma patients was 42 ± 34% between Day 1 and Day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, the total textual position (AUC0- ∞) achieved at once in three consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) was comparable to the value measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was above 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys, and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolism, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lower dimensions, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found in the urine within 144 hours, Palonosetron as an unchanged active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single intravenous injection of joints, the total body temperature was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminale elimination of elimination and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only following expositions which are considered sufficiently beyond the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of pre-clinical studies, indications that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ionic channels, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and prolong the capacity of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to approximately the 30times of the therapeutic exposure of humans), which were given daily for over two years, led to an increased incidence of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal mark) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is a unique application for humans, the relevance of these results than for humans is low.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The owner of this permit shall notify the European Commission on the plans for placing the drug approved as part of this decision.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report recommending the approval of the drug use Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injector solution intended for the treatment of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon was supposed to resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug which is already approved in the EU (also called "reference doctor").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damage damages, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanin- aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood abnormally are increased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates this to the formation of the active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data demonstrating the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, effectiveness, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference physician to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study showed how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was taken to the drug (i.e. no symptoms of the virus indicated in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease flamed more patients once more than with the reference physician; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition to this, the test used in the study to investigate the question, to what extent the medication forms an immune response (i.e. the body trains antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected Lazerations (crack or chives), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been demonstrably or presumably caused by methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied to patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the skin surface to be treated should not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should reexamine the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together at Hautwunden, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was noted that Altargo was not effective enough in treating abscesses (eiterfilled cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a stimulus at the site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo predominate in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmes, abrasions or stitched wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensitization or severe local irritation by applying the retapamulin ointment the treatment should be canceled, the ointment carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not supposed to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or worsening of the infected place after a 2-3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical use on moderately skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous offering of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% retapamulin ointment on scared skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary when topical retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient regarding a statement regarding the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is to be preferred by the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the breastfeeding continues / expired or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / stopped, the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the site, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance which is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The effect mechanism of retapamines is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosoms that differs from the ties of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the Bindungsstelle ribosomales protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-Bindungsstelle and the Peptidyltransferasezentrum.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline blocking the peptidyltransfer, partly block P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of retapamines in at least some infection forms seem questionable, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retapamines compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treat S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Absorption In a healthy adult study, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was taken daily under occlusion to intact and on shredded skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was carried out in days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the mediation and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 off skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolic of retapamines in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, less than CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid gland changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro-examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mouse-lymphoma test respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rats-microkernel test for In-vivo-examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 off skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats, oral dosing of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3 times of estimated human exposure (see above)), development stoicity (reduced body weight of the foetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity was established.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the permit must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the module 1.8.1 of the application, is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketing product is used.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the permit is obligated to conduct detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the RMP agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Human use, the updated RMP will be submitted to the next periodic Safety update report at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2717">To show irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated spot, you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it was not specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment comes out of sight on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a Gazeverband unless your doctor has advised you to cover the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic cap containing 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminum bag containing 0.5 g ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and fifteen years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccine existing from two doses, and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunization and is ensured that the vaccine from two doses can be led to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another Hepatitis A- or -B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the natural defence of the body), as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as" "" "foreign" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the Vaccine Twinrix Association approved since 1996 and has been the approved vaccine Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccine existing from three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the percentage of the vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix performed between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody levels against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambitie at a six-month and a 12-month gap between the injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may not be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002 the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the placing of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard priming plan for the priming with Ambirix consists of two inoculation doses, with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-HAV anti-HAV (anti-HAV) anti-HAV (anti-HAV) anti-HAV (anti-HAV) antibody are the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to a hepatitis vaccination need to have a chinoculation as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory in no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, the possibility of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is necessary, the standard pattern is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form alininated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there is no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-Hb antibody levels following the priming of the immune system, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccinations can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intraocular injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal impotence, these injection paths should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix can however be injected subcutaneously, since it can result in bleeding after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defences, it is necessary to assume that there is no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical trial which was carried out with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, fatigue, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the incidence observed in earlier Thiomer- and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, a total of 1027 vaccinations were given in a total of 1027 vaccinations ranging from 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a calculation basis per Vaccine Isis, but not based on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed at 50,7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the gift of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete inoculation cycle, 66,4% of the subjects who received Ambirix had over pain, compared to 63.8% among the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-D combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Maternity was comparable to pro trial (i.e. about the total inoculation cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix compared to 36.2% in the subjects who received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and fatigue was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1-11 year old vaccine, the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not pro trial, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of vaccines that reported severe side-effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted in vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years, the seroconverter rates for anti-HAV 99,1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose administered to the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Serokonverter rates for Anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose administered to the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted between 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was worthwhile, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response obtained from a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11-year-olds one month after the full inoculation series (i.e., in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>

<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- and including 15-year-olds, it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and Anti-Hb antibodies reported 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme is compared to that in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose ambirix in the second year of life was given at the same time with the refresher vaccination of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data known since the first approval for placing on the market, CHMP assumed that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, as Ambirix has been placed in traffic only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonis can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammonic encephalopathy (loss of brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonica is divided into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a Gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall in the stomach of leading tube) or a nasal sonde (through the nose into the stomach of leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, because Ammonaps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a pseudo-medicine, that is, without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps can also lead to loss of appetite, a abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances, or taste, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonies in patients with disorders of the urea cycle are effectively prevented from excessive ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was approved under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this drug was available." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life) there is an indication for the use if a hyperammonic encephalopathy is in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually with regard to the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for the growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early-manifested deficiency of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0,17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatal synthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered patients with swallowing disorders as a risk for the development of esophagusulcera occurs when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, accordingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be applied only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be applied only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowing of neuronal propagation and an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed emptying of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be established whether phenylacetate is excreted in breast milk in humans, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactic acid, severe hypokalemia, armorocopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occured in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms begin with the accumulation of phenylacetate that showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic compound which conjugated by acetylation of glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is eliminated by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate is produced for each gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is put at an early stage and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of early-manifested form of the disease with the occurrence of first symptoms in newborns was previously almost always infaust, and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogenous analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By means of hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (but within the first month of life) diagnosed diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonic encephalopathy, survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygine form of the Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonic encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is created.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism, and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate have been detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Following different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), no phenylacetate in plasma was detected after different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day).</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis treated repeatedly with Sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is excreted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrate had no clastogenic effects with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granulat is either taken orally (infants and children who do not have to swallow any tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a Gastrostomieschlauch or a nasal sonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborn babies, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early-manifested deficiency of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0,17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rats were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrate), there were lesions in the pyramids of the brain rinds.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactic acid, severe hypokalemia, armorocopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine with urea is comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate is produced for each gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granulate form 15 minutes after ingesting measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not more than 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS may also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products which accumulate after eating proteins in the body.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, decreased blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "St- Hebung" (an anomaly measured value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of Angiox was compared to a single gift or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) compared to conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often have a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - was as effective in preventing new incidents (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or one year as well as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, Angiox was as effective as heparin regarding all indicators, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalentine, other millet or other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as in people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">The European Commission granted approval to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd in September 2004 for the launch of Angiox throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">To treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (instabile Angina / non- ST lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervene or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initialdose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous dosage of 0,1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in further consequence, an additional pressure of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1,75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours following clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and one of these immediately following intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolus gift from Angiox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be effected.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, reconstitutive and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bolusdosis is quickly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT decreases more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min) to undergo a PCI (whether bivalent with ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dosage of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is reexamined again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT was 5 minutes after the gift of the bivalirudin-bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In case of severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of fractionated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalent in combination with another anticoagulant is administered (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though most arterial puncture points in the case of PCI patients suffer from arterial puncture points, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can occur during treatment in principle throughout bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking warfarin and treated with bivalent studies, a monitoring of the INR value (International Standardization) should be considered to ensure that the value after decomposition of treatment with bivalent degree is again achieved before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti-coagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytika or Thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors), these agents may increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalent studies with thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological haemostasis parameters are regularly checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal-experimental studies are insufficient in terms of effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, disinfection or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparative groups treated with heparin were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to Acuity and Timi standards for severe bleeding such as in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An Acuity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hematoma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of point, reduction of the haemoglobbinspiegels of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known bloodstream, reoperation due to a bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed hemorrhages that occured in more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study with bivalent studies in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparative groups treated with heparin were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice after comprehensive application and are classified according to system categories in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the case of an overdose, the treatment with bivalent udin can be stopped immediately and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombininhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic center and at the anion binding region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or straight.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalent udin to thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because thrombin is slowly splitting the binding of bivalentudin-ARG3-Pro4 slowly, thereby regenerates the function of the active centre of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, with serum of patients with serum-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS), bivalentine-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) was not inductive.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, bivalent studies show a dosage and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect which is verified by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the patients below, an additional radius of 0.5mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the Acuity study, unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in Arm A and B were also randomized to receive a GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor before the beginning of the angiography (at the time of the randomisation) or at the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the Acuity study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, were evenly distributed over the three arms.</seg>

<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple-end points of a randomized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are presented in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of Angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of bivalent studies were evaluated in patients who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalentudin as Peptid is going through a catabolism into its amino acid level with subsequent reutilisation of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolit which results from the splitting of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of Thrombin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm injected or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or the insulin can not work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter active time than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in the application in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In the case of type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot process insulin effectively, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in the first study compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin tricages.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the decrease of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin or one of the other ingredients, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for placing Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the decreased gluconogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin requirement in patients with a restriction of liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active strength, the brand (manufacturer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of manufacturing can change the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or failure of a treatment, in particular in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another producer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of the occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active section of the used insulin and can therefore change when switching to the treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that can increase blood sugar activity and increase propensity to hypoglycemias, oral antidiabetic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, dioxetine, fibrate, fluoroxetine, propoxyphene, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergic antiregulation can be weakened or absent from the effect of sympatholytics such as beta-blockers, clonidin, Guanethidin and reserpine.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisins occur in human breast milk, but generally insulin does not enter into the mother's milk, nor is it consumed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed from clinical trials, grouped according to system categories and classified according to decreasing incidence of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; not known (frequency based on disposable data is not estimable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, fear, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, concentration disturbances, lightening, excessive hun- ger, changes in eyesight, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is omitted to continuously change the injection site within the injection range, can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucoagonal injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially due to skeletal muscles and fat) and the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin-lulisin the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with cou- manem standard insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus insulin lulisin in the therapeutic relevant dosing area of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional amount of glucosa-lowering effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in glucosine effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosine effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was clear that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post-denoundiale glycaemic control is reached as with human regular insulin that is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better postoperative control was achieved than with human regular insulin that was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisin is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control as with human regular insulin, which is given 2 minutes before the meal (see Figure 1), is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at Gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal in comparison to human regular insulin that was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human regular insulin that was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin at a time of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal in comparison to human nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
