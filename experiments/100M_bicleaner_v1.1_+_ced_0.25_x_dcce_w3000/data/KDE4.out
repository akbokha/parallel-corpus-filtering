package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size they offer some additional features and simpli@@ fy the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or .
to load these modules in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or , select setting extensions ... Open the map tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of default setup modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that more modules may be on your system if you have installed additional software .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click Extras Ab@@ st√ºr@@ ze . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or the list of cr@@ ashes if available .
the module p@@ age@@ filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DOM tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DOM tree ... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed page . as pres@@ etting , the display begins with the root node of the document , example : an element , all other no@@ des are sub elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views so as to view the contents of your local file system .
the specific@@ ity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of graphi@@ cally depicted fil@@ tering hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called Tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in w@@ ax@@ ed structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder defined as the sum of the size of the items in it . thus , large files , even then easily recognized , can be easily recognized when viewed far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , you can view it as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the File Transfer display is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have useful inking and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle which is switched over view color mode can either be depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of any other file property like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for the display or if the area is to be used by lower right angles ( whereby , therefore , display error by restrictions on the mark of the use ) .
in the case of display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the item . in the case of the Tre@@ ad in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always respected . it is drawn frames to represent the dis@@ sem@@ ination of the entries . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rect@@ angle is square .
how spl@@ itting the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is done , the implementation remains up to it . in this case , it is always advantageous for the label and to avoid space losses due to fra@@ me@@ works that are as quadra@@ tic as possible . the best methods of this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive distribution .
you can specify the minimum per@@ missible space for an entry via the menu item View An@@ y on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the over@@ arch@@ ed entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to using the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets designed to apply K@@ Cach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the module gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras \ &apos; s gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the picture gallery , a dialog opens with which you can set the appearance of the gallery .
the option title of the page allows you to custom@@ ize the title of the gallery page in a text input field .
the option pictures per line has a slider and a field of rotation to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .

copy the original images to copy the original images to the gallery .
to use the comments file , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nail images as in the original images in the check box .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under extras HTML @-@ Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; contains a fast image processing with base image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded using K@@ DE Image Plugins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , there are dozens of professional capabilities available . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG Export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens to be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also called &amp; digi@@ ous ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; tries to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu includes an entry problems or requests .... This will open a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in error reporting system . all required information is listed here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ous ; then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; but in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ pack ; homepage to see news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing in the developer mailing list from &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you click &amp; digi@@ pack ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path will remain the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ pack ; will also be used as an Al@@ ben@@ Library . preferences digi@@ Kam set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images , as a basic folder . &amp; digi@@ pack ; looks at any sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed . while searching the folder you will see a progress indication like this :
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ dic@@ ates recur@@ sively the library path in all its depth . you can &apos;t excl@@ ude sub @-@ folders unless it is in hidden folder . this allows you to insert extra sub@@ folders and digi@@ ti@@ sed by adding a point in front of the sub@@ folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . for more details , see the Albums section .
once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; set up your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to use my albums and my key@@ word boxes to manage your photos in the albums .
raw data support : if you use the raw @-@ mode of your camera , &amp; digi@@ ous ; possibly also deal with it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support .
how to setup this and work with raw files is described in sections of raw decoder settings and raw workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash , Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera is then used as a disk drive . the camera can also be realized via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera . Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras , which has developed an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . it also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Im@@ aging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images of digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos are generally large files and transm@@ is@@ sions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ pack ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ tization can be read reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , thumb@@ nail images may not be seen or the creation might be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules with all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ ous ; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; do yourself .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 res@@ p . C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
moving and laying images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ma , via the horizontal divi@@ ding line or another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be depos@@ ited in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type sel@@ ector allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view at the moment . so the fil@@ tering on the fil@@ en@@ ame works only if this ind it symbol view is displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the settings settings .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album room . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were recorded on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date the album was created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan an album Import images . you can also add a screenshot to an album . select Album Import Screen Sho@@ t .
in order to copy or move an image from an album to another , you can move the photo to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to click on the album with the right mouse button and select Edit properties in the context menu .
Alb@@ um@@ - Colle@@ ctions : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos , if you choose to sort the collection from the tool@@ bar or view the albums sorted by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do it in the Settings for Colle@@ ctions .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums , sort by date .
the buttons elder , average , ne@@ sts : these put the date on that of the oldest , the newest image or the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder .
when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first image is selected in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ sis quot ; this will help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in one collection and collections cannot be w@@ ax@@ ed .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the My key@@ word list left bottom in the main window . album collections always have a different effect . the collection includes all the photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures will be shown in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can custom@@ ize the size of this preview using the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a little while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this allows you to avoid using the preview images in the Tools menu .
information on each image will be displayed below the related preview . what information this is , you can talk about settings digi@@ p@@ ated ; set up . click here the albums page and adjust the range of thumb@@ nails to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help window which appear . if you leave the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screenshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such help window .
photos are all that matters at &amp; digi@@ kam ; goes . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to perform a number of improvements to this . you can use all the functions that are with &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can choose between viewing the pictures , a slide show or the editing of the pictures .
you can open the image editing with a photo by clicking on either F@@ 4 image Edit ... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... . in the digi@@ pack section , you will find a guide how to edit your photos . with the image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . to this , and how to custom@@ ize it to your needs if your program is not enum@@ er@@ ated , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing with other image editing programs , there can be problems with the met@@ adata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , ap@@ ert@@ ure , etc .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way to click on the preview and select rotation . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it is moved in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image del@@ e@@ tion or Del if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ p@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way of organising and cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ing your photos . Tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found again by selecting this key@@ word or search .
if a key@@ word is selected , all photos marked with this key@@ word will be shown .
Tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My stu@@ b word@@ list@@ quot ; so you can easily find the keywords you &apos;re looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . in addition , the keywords are re @-@ imported in the loss of the database as soon as &amp; digi@@ came ; the pictures are noticed .
you can add new keywords by clicking on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; or click on an existing key@@ word and then select new key@@ word . if you want to add a new key@@ word after you cli@@ cked on an existing key@@ word , this is the sub@@ stit@@ ch@@ word of this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and selecting delete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo will not be deleted itself . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place it down . then a menu appears that gives you the chance to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; change .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right button of the mouse and select it in the context menu as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
um &amp; digi@@ kam ; s functionality with keywords to handle , first you need to provide your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want with a key@@ word , you can drag them to the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; alternatively , you can also use the right mouse button to select the thumb@@ nails and select from the context menu key@@ word .
you can provide a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was done etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word , in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Rem@@ ove from the symbol menu . the menu only displays the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
the time beam view displays a time @-@ dependent hi@@ ring of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the frame , which displays the time unit . thus , all associated images are displayed in the main window .
in the box below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more .
the search box is a small lamp that gets green when the search is found . if you click on it , the fil@@ tering is deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the rider on the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you entered as a search crit@@ erion .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be performed . the results are displayed in the My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection once again , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit search , the search form will appear again with the search information entered before . if you choose to edit as extended search , the dialog will appear for advanced search to change your previous search . here , more rules are available for searching . more information can be found in the section The tool for Advanced search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the context menu .
the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ at@@ enbank . all rules are displayed by operators separated , enum@@ er@@ ated . one option can be added to this list by search group / search group . any option can be associated with others about the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... you can create searches of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ GHT .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; each image is characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natur@@ es . the lower the difference between two sig@@ natur@@ es , the more they correspond to each other . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar one . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ exact search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can let it fall there .
sk@@ etch : free hand @-@ color sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ pack ; find the matching pictures . here , too , a sw@@ elling value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can use the mouse wheel or zoom in or hold it . move it while you push the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to drag a square . all images within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this assumes , of course , your pictures contain Ge@@ o @-@ data .
in the bottom field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ directory .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em Light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and its window is opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ al ; main window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire with L Extras Spor@@ table .
from the preview tool@@ bar , you can drag the images you want to compare , to the left or right corner of the window and place it . a small arrow will show you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select preview of the tool@@ bar and perform the Zoo or shooting operations on one of the images , then you can compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you use pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for compar@@ isons . use the left mouse button at any thumb@@ nail to display it on the left . this makes it easy to work through a number of similar images .
of course normal del@@ e@@ tion actions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nail images . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom end of each section you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to rot@@ ate the visible area of the image , you need to click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the Preview Mode , both pictures will display the same image area .
the zoom functions just like in other views . just use the Zoom slider under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images if you are pre@@ viewing in the mode preview .
what is a digital stock management - apart from the bu@@ zz@@ word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process , after the image has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos takes , sc@@ ans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect , and use photos again . we will focus on the procedures for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ pack ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , re@@ viewing , archiving , optimi@@ zing , archiving , archiving , storing and exp@@ orting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management takes up , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , ass@@ ures , searches , transformed , conf@@ ection@@ ate and exports content that have a monetary or cultural value .@@ quot ;
met@@ adata is defined as data about data . met@@ adata is based on your definition data , which provide information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I venture to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need no inventory management to find a certain photo . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store the met@@ adata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and a secure archiving to you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know before you incorporate any information into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you do enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements like ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files match together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or an derived image .
we also recommend saving the met@@ adata option in the met@@ adata settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written to the file . if you forget this then you can subsequently save the met@@ adata from the database in the files by selecting the respective item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what if you want to change which ones ? it provides and digi@@ p@@ ated ; they provide a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course , these are the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you should now assign keywords , inscription and valuation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value then . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos at the further work .
let &apos;s start with keywords , keywords , as you often call in other programs or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you , res@@ etting the images to the right place . the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by drag@@ ging one sub@@ strate to another .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation as each block of met@@ adata exists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool for cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ing your met@@ adata .
you don &apos;t want to just let anyone share your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming of having associations , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who consider your photos the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a label for itself to work alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text in an internation@@ alised alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE can even export it to your wishes into the let@@ tering and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now runs with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already in@@ calcul@@ able and will be deep@@ ened in the future . I am sure that some@@ day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels through images with ge@@ ographic data . &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can also export the photos at the reception site . you can also export the images to Gallery@@ 2 , pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ckr &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the furnish@@ ing page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author Title ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s work name . examples of this can be titles such as : employed photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who the photo offers . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify them in the picture . for individuals , this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ ous ; will be available in the near future such a module for stac@@ king processing .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kind of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem of CDs / DVDs , these must be dealt with cau@@ tious and you can no longer believe them than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that will claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can reduce this risk in which you are using good discs and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD Capture Devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you have just been written . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster , which seems to do wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks appear to capture the format war against HD DVD . a Dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said on CDs and DVDs is of course also available for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
slowly burn with a good recording device on top quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . likewise , read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store the data on a clean , dark dry and protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disc@@ ern@@ ing manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer &apos;s antioxid@@ ants com@@ prise a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this topic .
in short : dis@@ cos are kept at the longest when operating in temperature range from 35 ¬∞ C to 45 ¬∞ C. The error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , SM@@ ART can &apos;t determine these faul@@ ts . some of SM@@ ART &apos;s errors indicate the im@@ min@@ ent failure .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a current failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices don &apos;t matter much , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high speed processes . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause heavy damage , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against sp@@ ik@@ es is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy slots and bi@@ ds the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . but remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it offers protection against lightning strike and therefore protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage divi@@ ders that also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mo@@ de@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds may result in the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a break @-@ free power supply .
besides the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically make battery power available when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to store your data and run the system . if you purchase a US@@ V then you should be sure they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lif@@ esp@@ an of the battery and the included software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in power dis@@ rup@@ tions with the cost to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should always remember all the cables before you travel to the holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can include it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
they are expensive compared to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ckr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . their free storage is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality only .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are cleaned automatically thanks to the TCP protocol , and with the large companies it is included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the calcul@@ ator . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one says to you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disturb@@ ances remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection for it in your computer . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ rup@@ tions within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly concerned about transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leopard with a G@@ PL compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon also for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in english .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f file system . this is still in the Alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to less damage , such as theft or re @-@ installation . and it is currently confined to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source fil@@ es@@ ystems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS , and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden dis@@ ruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 ap@@ ert@@ ure settings from fundamental physical borders . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural boundary for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apixel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result rather deteri@@ or@@ ates . even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 750@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not blame anybody else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a data loss each year . so , secure your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or res@@ izing disk drives .
suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash will hit you luck when the drive was not connected at the moment .
disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget air@@ crafts : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the complete house .
therefore Des@@ p@@ aving Pre@@ vention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring up your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neigh@@ bor house , into your office or similar .
there is another benefit of physical separation : as stated above is a common reason for data loss in spite of securing the panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last full backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : to the full backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : backup of the files that have been modified since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made . this backup comes closest to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system , with the exception that is only tar@@ nished and is not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference between files that have been changed . this happens when you want to increase security via ss@@ h .
backup important images directly after saving them on your computer to a DVD or a different visual media .
this approach gives you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . each additional th@@ inning should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review .

so precious images survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predict@@ able due to your nature , you must consider all that is being said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate during the time . unfortunately , there is no other way than a certain vig@@ il@@ ance for@@ wards . all 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system has been used back@@ wards . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should review your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability , and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . with * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and store it onto a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new plate has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it in .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ dc # source is / dev / s@@ dc &amp; dollars ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of disk in MB@@ gt ; # functions with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the drive if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . you should therefore no longer use it .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard , but it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can use gam@@ ma and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color allocation for hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files .
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is developed on the TIFF / EP format and inde@@ b@@ ted to the use of met@@ adata . a hand@@ ful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope the competitors Canon and Nikon will also use it at some point .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a blend of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive . X@@ MP adap@@ ts to it because it stores the met@@ adata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the met@@ adata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , the raw format will decay . therefore , you should consider whether you use DNG as containers and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compliant online met@@ adata standards that support a wide range of application and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I include work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and D@@ CM@@ I communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the cam@@ eram@@ an , you can use it as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images back with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ pped , then you should add the met@@ adata again . under certain circumstances , these were cut off by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them to web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the addition of a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import pictures to your album database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera into the display mode and turn it on . you will find another description in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it attempts to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a remote indicator appears at the bottom and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display preview images . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file association settings for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can view the properties of an entry or its met@@ adata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras don &apos;t have all the information available .
the met@@ adata tab displays the internal met@@ adata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the met@@ adata tool@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or the image editing . note that these met@@ adata is not available in some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of All . this loads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the option you want with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button to download the selected selection button . download the S@@ elected button until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ joined until now . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you use the buttons All download or download sel@@ ections , a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are disc@@ ar@@ ded . the list of existing albums will be displayed in the My albums section . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the Del@@ ete Del@@ ete button . if you want to delete only a few , then you have to select them first and then delete the selected selection .
please note that there is no possibility to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check whether the photos were successfully deleted from the camera ; so you should carefully check whether the photos are successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to delete the camera filter completely , you should do this by camera , as this is much faster .
cameras are often used as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re @-@ used after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can result in double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you upload photos of different recording series into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub@@ ano@@ ints . if you use this option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options during transmission are opening three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two affect the data via the author in the Standard Autor@@ et@@ Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn off the date &amp; time option . for further modifications , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading . or in upper@@ case if you prefer it .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ ous ; uses for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during the download . not all cameras provide this information . in the page bar met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , the photo is in its original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced tab and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ ous ; this is used to automatically create under@@ scores in the target album . all pictures with the same date are provided in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar met@@ a data , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ p@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn this option on . use the Advanced tab and select the date @-@ based sub@@ ano@@ ints at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer is the download button . then select up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , queries &amp; digi@@ kam ; you , where the images are to be up@@ loaded . a folder selection dialog appears for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in length and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . determination of data can be carried out by the American GPS , Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an air@@ plane to account for an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environment plann@@ ers , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another and digi@@ pack ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to pack the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as the direction , sem@@ it@@ ones and map references . the question is actually more how the data comes into these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the ge@@ ographic allocation ( manual ) and last@@ ly by manual input of known places .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that integ@@ rates a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or by transferring the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in g@@ px format , as this is the only format supported by the module to the ge@@ ographic allocation .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool from Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pres@@ idents ha@@ iry coordinates created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation data for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; tries to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ ame . to access these settings , you need to choose settings digi@@ ously in the Settings menu . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left hand side .
select action can be displayed on st@@ ained pre@@ viewing or editing image editing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ous ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standard identity and copyright data . these data are automatically written in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author Title is a syn@@ onym for author line : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . these can be desig@@ nations such as photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the field , this must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . this will ensure that the met@@ adata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ ous ; these met@@ adata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ Imp@@ orted without being lost .
save images of images as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos with the inscription embedded in the pictures . this allows your recordings to be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cur@@ sor rests in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ pack ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ pack , try , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire from &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set on this page to the default values . each time you open the lumin@@ aire , these settings can be switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better visual results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use the image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant to enco@@ des the images in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance density than in the color de@@ formations . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
with the setting of PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality as PNG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the option TIFF files compressed , you can turn the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of TIFF images . it does not affect image quality as the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm works loss @-@ free .
by setting los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ s@@ less setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the default assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if the straight @-@ line green pixels react to sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a minimal loss of details . this option distingu@@ ishes the picture a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance , which is based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the more pointed , so the parts of your images are burned in , because of the in@@ ability of your camera to catch the nick@@ name , as pier@@ cing white . use the setting color trig@@ gering some unusual results as it displays the peak lights in various ros@@ aries . last@@ ly , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ ous ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struction option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image editing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the image data that come from the fil@@ tered image sensor that has many cameras and provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or color design .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; and D@@ cra@@ w provides three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like that . as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive homogen@@ eity @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color correction , since you are done during the un@@ conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions how to return it . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ plugs ; information about how to translate the color information from a colour space to the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image editing / color management module with raw files .
color profile folders S@@ enter the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c , or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c in which you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ ous ; check this folder then during startup .
settings of ICC @-@ Profile You have the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your images are color @-@ administered not the entire screen .
the input profiles should correspond to the camera manufacturer and model that you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color @-@ tone mapping or gam@@ ma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gam@@ ma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate on how to em@@ ulate your image from a device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious what color profile is provided for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . so here a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension lets you see the style for the finish : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ ous ; many modules support that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will then be loaded from &amp; digi@@ pack ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the Settings menu in the Settings menu .
more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be accessed via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adju@@ sts the time between the frame outputs , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other buttons switch on or off the met@@ adata that are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
camera properties are shown on the left hand side of a list of all supported cameras . on the right side there is a kno@@ b auto detection , trying to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use it , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . among these are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire storage are supported .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B- and Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage am@@ eras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire storage camera from the camera list . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera .
to use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed your digital camera , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn on .
try out if &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images to the M√ºl@@ lei@@ mer , you can preview &amp; digi@@ pack the conversation ; when you delete a photo in an album , you can find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ joined ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any questions . otherwise , you need to save changes to the button modifications .
you can also include the indication of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the starting process , this will speed up the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ ous ; .
setting the Start after new photos forces &amp; digi@@ came ; searching the basic folder for new or deleted photos / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ pack ; . if something was deleted from the root folder , queries &amp; digi@@ kam ; you , if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to custom@@ ize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; includes a fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button to preview a picture or through the context menu of the preview and selecting the item A@@ ds / Edit .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ pack ; so they may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , please refer to the image processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current fil@@ en@@ ame , magni@@ fication coefficient and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing features of image editing will change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using the Save or Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file save as .
as long as you haven &apos;t saved the photo , you can restore the original image by restor@@ ing from the File menu or use the button Rest@@ ore the image editing Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last store .
virtually every action of the image editing can be und@@ one or re@@ produced . the last action you can undo by selecting Edit Res@@ et or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for re@@ course and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the undo / restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will also be und@@ one or restored .
once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
to custom@@ ize a photo to the window size , you can use this button on the tool@@ bar : automatically select the magni@@ fication factor
view full@@ screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . normally the tool@@ bar will appear . if you do not wish to do so , you can change it in the Settings dialog .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu , you can print single images or entire sets . entire image pr@@ elo@@ ads can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Ex@@ ports print@@ wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation path , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the border again .
in the panel view , you can enter or insert certificates with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the inscription is copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should note these restrictions .
after you have commented on it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next picture , the inscription will then be saved .
besides the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the met@@ adata in the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a met@@ adata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section displays a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and gra@@ dation . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ el Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the enco@@ ding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the key@@ word view displays a search box for the fil@@ tering of the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a box with the keywords before .
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the given key@@ word . you can restrict the number of options when searching for a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when typ@@ ing keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate cross@@ roads in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the key@@ word IP@@ TC field .
if you select several images in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a sample with a key@@ word , please refer to the key@@ word filter section .
the side@@ bar stu@@ b key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and search views . if additionally one or more key@@ word filter is used from the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and place keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view , to give you keywords . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears , which asks you if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images in a calendar day . the key@@ word filter stands on no keywords , which reduces the quantity to three images . they were selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree was drawn to the selection and filed there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off on Settings .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be a or be , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry to which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
you can , for example , specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ came ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ administered workflow is that the colors that have been photograph@@ ed by your camera or scanner will have a predict@@ able devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ administered workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resem@@ ble those of your camera or scanner and that correspond to the colors you print or publish on the web from your digital dark@@ room .
when the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you can get the desired result .
if your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
your only other pictures are by email or web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and have to think about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colours we can see , the hu@@ fei@@ sen@@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click on Info and then on information about RGB working spaces .
do I have to cal@@ li@@ fy my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working in a s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to cal@@ li@@ fy your monitor because s@@ RGB is designed to cal@@ li@@ fy your monitor . if you work as a s@@ RGB colour space , you must either cal@@ li@@ fy your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before you attempt any further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , merge , automatic devi@@ ation and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ ans the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out .
matching : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ous factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes , the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation , which causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic compensation : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it calcul@@ ates the dark and bright mar@@ gins and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
extending Con@@ trast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values in the wid@@ est possible range and a new ji@@ us@@ on of all values in between . this is only visible with exposed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ ous ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you are too far from the original picture , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better off .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. Joch@@ ym . you start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the tool settings . if you want to see the original white balance again , you can click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
a hist@@ ogram shows that dynam@@ ically is changed once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether any of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shade of adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in the white balance . this will appear in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and Up@@ load are doing exactly this . every adjustment of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load later again .
the Prefer@@ ences button returns all filter values to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the enco@@ ding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this enco@@ ding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ tone mapping can be performed through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management .
another important tool is to find color correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time , so that you can use it for multiple photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner will always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for the sound correction , you will find more information .
a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool colour effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar system effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect created when a partially developed pressure em@@ itted a short flash light and then inver@@ ted the development of the picture . this had the effect that the lighter areas dar@@ ker and the colors inver@@ ted through the second illumination . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar power . with approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase finally creates a negative image , so that it is not produced on phot@@ op@@ aper .
this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . try it simple , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color with daylight and high contra@@ sts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large images , the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photo . you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too great satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation rather than raising it . all changes you can perform can be viewed in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / gam@@ ma , the tool is used for improving exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slider for the purposes described here .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to post@@ p@@ one the controller and take care of how the image changes .
on the right side , the original and thumb@@ nail preview can be viewed . the preview is updated dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image . on the left side the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear representation is often dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is more useful .
three regul@@ ators : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the bottom for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma values .
the three colour pin@@ p@@ ettes can be pre@@ viewed in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadow , medium and light tones . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . the compression of the output values can , for example , be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreg@@ round .
automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later re@@ charged . in addition , the Gim@@ p Lev@@ els format is used .
if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , media and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see an example of adjusting the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side is displayed half of the original and the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fi@@ zi@@ ere channel : this box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images that were taken with a digital camera , linear mode usually generates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode continues .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with dar@@ ker output tones and that the associated pixels are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marking to see . if you want to shift this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons , you can do exactly that . each curve you created can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three pi@@ p@@ ettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , mid@@ - and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you will get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shadow and sun shades were placed with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image editing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram appears to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will keep the overall brightness as the channel mixer then is DAS tool for generating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from far@@ rowing . far@@ rowing is made up of small rough art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose pattern is different in each channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you reduce the color need first .
save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any Mixer setting can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ancy Store is enabled . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / White has always been fascinating because of its abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step as color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green l@@ enti@@ l filter . this looks good at all scene images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simul@@ ate moon light scenes at day@@ time . so similar to the 003 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color ton@@ ic correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold in the shades of shame . this is very similar to the process of failure of a pressure and the re@@ development in a sep@@ ia scho@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
use the &amp; digi@@ pack ; apply tool texture to apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , no matter if it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the image .
a paper texture effect was applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; adding tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye . to add frame frame the module can be started from image editing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . the image with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce transfers it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame , ideal for a button effect and decorative inser@@ ts an ornamental frame with patterns .
width : specify the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also works in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from color space and character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you click OK . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
using the &amp; digi@@ pack ; to apply tool template you can place a template using a picture .
the picture menu template uses in image editing can be used to put templates over a picture .
for the template , there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of template . if you want to add your sten@@ cil template to your templates , just send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ liste digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil template with the root folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be marked for the next start .
after the root folder for the templates was set , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the templates folder . selecting a folder updates the templates automatically .
below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but it creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
the sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of edges to let a picture look shar@@ per . actually , it &apos;s not a bit tough@@ er . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is probably the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust .
images without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is due to the digi@@ tization process colours with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn leads to sharp edges a bit bl@@ ur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually need more retro@@ fitting than normal cameras for private users .
image in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a sharp@@ ness filter already during the reading of the image . if you disable this , you get the control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness . you can call up shar@@ pen@@ ing with the menu entry .
you should deal with this , however , as the results do not seem very natural : shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also strengthens the noise . in general , the most useful technique is to re@@ focus the tool . you can easily re@@ focus more information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ tw@@ ise soft signs and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ ly mas@@ king is a very good tool for removing veil@@ s from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview can help you edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase of the radius or the amount ampli@@ fies the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will produce near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore sharp@@ ly shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the sw@@ elling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference @-@ amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference for a edge of the filter . in this way areas with a soft change between the sounds are excluded from shar@@ pen@@ ing and hence beauty fl@@ aws in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces .
this is an example for the un@@ sharp m@@ asked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter -@@ algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to re@@ focus a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focus quot ; in which it revers@@ ing the picture . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask .
in practice , the circular folding operates much better than the Gau@@ ge &apos;s fold . the Gau@@ √ü &apos; split has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the spring pixel , which is far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ √ü &apos; split is actually very strongly influenced by the remote pixels .
circular acu@@ ity : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results .
cor@@ relation : an increase in the cor@@ relation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.99 . a high value for cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
noise filters : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 , the image quality will be very bad .
Gau@@ √ü &apos; sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the pal@@ ate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your bl@@ ur@@ red g@@ auss is &apos; sch . this is most commonly caused by a previously executed bl@@ ur filter . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you use a value non @-@ zero , you may also need to increase cor@@ relation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the matrix . an increase in die size can generate good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular shar@@ pen@@ ing or the Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow when selecting large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible , which will later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur@@ ring . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
this image has to be corrected with an an@@ alogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the field of sharp@@ ness correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regul@@ ator Gl@@ √§t@@ te sets the bl@@ ur@@ ring of the area dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink tin@@ plate allows a customized paint for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting Algorith@@ m was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the CI@@ M project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the Gl@@ √§t@@ tung and Advanced Settings tab .
details post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ th@@ ness over the picture . if greater values are mainly homo@@ geneous regions fl@@ atten and details . a value of 0.9 should provide details so that no acu@@ ity is necessary .
direction dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes uni@@ form@@ ly in all directions while a value close to 1 is only smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ularity or CCD Rau@@ schen , a high value creates wav@@ y patterns . JPEG arti@@ facts are best fixed at a value near 1 .
smoothing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor over all@@ y. p then defines the relative smoo@@ th@@ ness . therefore set this value matching the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; tower effect it must be set higher than 3 .
re@@ peti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally , there is 1 or 2 here .
angle @-@ Width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is chosen small , there should also be small chosen . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as greatest as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral incre@@ ments &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral incre@@ ments in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by choosing this option is only low . however , it dou@@ bles the term . we therefore recommend it to let it out .
the buttons Save as and Up@@ load are doing exactly this . correc@@ ting any image errors can be saved in a text file and later re@@ charged .
image errors can be corrected relatively quickly at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the ab@@ ort button .
below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an an@@ alogue camera . as you see , there is a unique black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreg@@ round that caused by a bad film shift during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove spots and other arti@@ facts such as dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor screws from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
below you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the advanced settings window can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and therefore smaller errors are cleared .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front to determine light density changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter can no longer get the image details and noise or lubric@@ ation occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not remove all the noise or noise peaks can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
gam@@ ma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , typically smo@@ ther@@ ed more strongly .
d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter d@@ amping . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , edges and phase j@@ itter may appear at edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it .
store and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) corrected . the noise reduction was used with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool to sof@@ tw@@ ise soft signs and experiment with the smoo@@ th@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photographic art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ √ü &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture composition . the texture replacement is performed using a different tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the CI@@ M project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ ac@@ ts@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons save as and loading do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very quickly at work . however , it can take a very long time and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise levels . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie has been recorded on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious fil@@ ing on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected at ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera close to eight . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression of hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; in a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the Dunkel@@ image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you pick up the dark image directly to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD fail@@ ures .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it again in the next session .
the image area and the preview can help you correct the result inside the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all thumb@@ nail areas .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and see the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ ing : an average of neighbour pixels is measured . the resulting color is assigned to all faul@@ ty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture can be seen below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the ap@@ ert@@ ure filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with Center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise im@@ mi@@ tive effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure of today &apos;s film and color or grey scales of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was taken without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ tier@@ ungs@@ correction applies the transformation with a Cent@@ er@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators , you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the level of light intensity at the point of the greatest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which provides an optical filter with a lens setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction decreases the lumin@@ ous intensity of pixels . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options .
if you want a more subtle re @-@ adjustment of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ pack ; image editing from the color gra@@ dation menu .
the original picture ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a magni@@ fication and contrast correction was also carried out with the image using this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; len@@ tic@@ ular distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth gra@@ des cor@@ re@@ cts the distant corners to that of the second grade . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion can be almost eliminated .
in general : this value controls the strength of distor@@ tion of the second grade . with negative values t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distor@@ tion of the fourth grade . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter General .
zoom : this value sc@@ ans the image size and thus results in correc@@ ting the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image is smaller .
bri@@ gh@@ ten : this value Adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustr@@ ates the distor@@ tion correction . the values that you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start .
the t@@ onn@@ - or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all tri@@ mming or size changes . best guide this correction as the first . if you cut a picture new and then perform a t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction the effect would obviously be the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line . move it to an important place , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards you can correct the t@@ onn@@ - / cushion distor@@ tion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distor@@ tion , the resulting image will have black edges . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu Transform@@ ate crop from the image processing or via the Zoom slider of this dialog .
the next logical step for some moti@@ fs , e.g. shots from the front , frame and paintings , is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example of t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film from the G@@ imp@@ ber u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the image .
below the Preview you can set two parameters set fil@@ ming and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add film gran@@ ulation when you want to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in converting . green meadows are white like snow !
because the filter color channels are mixed to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ me@@ tic applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter film gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for re@@ producing film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known by classical high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix great silver grains of photo emul@@ sion .
the projection effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , gra@@ iny appearance specially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
the regul@@ ator can cali@@ br@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the grains . the default value is , although higher values are required , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the fil@@ med effect effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; oil painting filter gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . fl@@ atten@@ s controls the smoo@@ th@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sti@@ ff@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sk@@ etch . the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images of their gra@@ dients are slowly changing and therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch you . this would be good pictures to start .
there are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoothing ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Filter Grav@@ ur is a fast tool to give your pictures back with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ arch landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , equal to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distor@@ tion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : similar to the wave blocks 1 the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of im@@ mi@@ tive effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom In@@ sp@@ ection : bl@@ ur@@ ks the image along star @-@ shaped lines from a center point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels to the center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
bl@@ ur@@ ring : wi@@ pes the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : taking pictures from a car or train , camera .
sof@@ tening sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image soft@@ ly into the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour images or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low .
sho@@ oter sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image through random displac@@ ement of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of an invol@@ unt@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur@@ ring : finds the color in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the picture into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your image . this gives it natural to your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop @-@ size does not automatically increase with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish au@@ gen changes the visual effect of drops on the image .
you can choose with the &amp; digi@@ pack ; editing an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen fil@@ tering . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) points a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the right direction through mirrors or turning . the tools can be found in the menu Transform@@ ieren Dre@@ hen or Transformers mirrors .
photo bub@@ bles are definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of picture quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp@@ ly ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the CI@@ F algorithm used here makes here a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transform@@ ieren size change in the menu and enter the target values .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool for blowing .
many image editing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by I@@ MAGE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the CI@@ M project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
keep aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the original image aspect ratio will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; tower effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and Up@@ load are used for exactly this purpose . enlarge each photo magni@@ fication for photo can be saved as a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take a very long time and draw a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
you can see below an example for photo bub@@ bles by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a often under@@ estimated operation , but also a frequently under@@ rated tool to create an image . to crop a photo you need to create a picture with the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle as you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the cli@@ pping area by drag@@ ging on the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button of the cutting button of image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries to save or save file under the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by drag@@ ging the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved .
in the tool Fol@@ ding aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait format or landscape format . in the portrait format , the greater value of the height and the cross @-@ format is assigned to the width .
the tool Fol@@ ding to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inch or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
below in the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area to crop on the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool Fol@@ ding aspect ratio stores its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings will be stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed image measurements are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflects the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the co@@ hesi@@ on help allow you to blend in , so that you can put your pictures together better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of res@@ emb@@ lance . like the third @-@ el@@ bow , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in a similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal .
golden center : the golden center is a division divided into different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flower leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; and the divi@@ ding divi@@ der is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides liquid aid lines if you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spi@@ ral will bring you good results for your photos . in comparison to the third rule , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition condu@@ cts the view of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angle . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spiral discussed above . its verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angle . note that unlike the harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal on these lines can be placed a static object dynam@@ ically .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your picture focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
flip options horizont@@ ally and mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture around any angle .
if you make a photo then it easily happens that you don &apos;t hold the camera exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing and tool free rotation . select transform@@ ieren free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rot@@ ate your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the Prefer@@ ences button you can set the slider back to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right top .
for your help , the Module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
once you have turned a picture , you will find und@@ esi@@ rable tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the function transform@@ ieren crop cut out of image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally sli@@ ce function . choose one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the picture a bit after rotation . however , keep in mind the above warning .
all persp@@ ectiv@@ al transform@@ ations are performed around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re @-@ calculated . on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left edge of the transformed area .
angle right up : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the picture becomes slightly dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing .
the enco@@ ding tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is not a rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a right angle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
sc@@ roll your image by using horizontal and vertical angles . you can put horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will show you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be shown to the right of the preview area .
move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the she@@ ar , the picture will wi@@ pe a bit . for a single she@@ ar this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two notes producing twice as much wi@@ pes and therefore you should avoid this .
after the she@@ ar , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , compiled by the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; shows only files in formats that you know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the file is displayed in image editing .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to even select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ ous ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way in this way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful tut@@ orials in English . you can convert rough format images in JPEG or TIFF to the raw image converter of &amp; digi@@ kam ; in section configuration you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the charging of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ pack ; with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave &apos;s Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam .
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are frequently saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ ous ; but is not a movie editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ ous ; the &amp; k@@ de ; Settings to play movies use to start the program to play .

many tools you need the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ pack ; your description follows here .
all image editing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , m@@ oll@@ us@@ cs , noise supp@@ ression , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialogue type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . on the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparative mode of the preview area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the field on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal divi@@ ding without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower part shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally . the upper area shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the Preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be customized in the general setting page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place on the part of the image you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be marked .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Charac@@ ter@@ istics : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data origin@@ ate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can use the mouse wheel or zoom in or hold it . move it while you push the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to drag a square . all images within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this assumes , of course , your pictures contain Ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allet files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ etten files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog p@@ allet , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or search the folders for files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the p@@ allet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it indicates the color next to it . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . afterwards , move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ urs@@ or is activated below the button color , the color is inserted from the color chart at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write was selected . this mode allows you to select by selecting the crossing field below Bei@@ m C@@ urs@@ or .
a selection that was created in such a way as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color , three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional dy@@ e , followed by a line ending character , if another color follows . if three figures are in the cli@@ p@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the color selection output can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color sel@@ ector on the left side .
&amp; k@@ demo@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , in particular in computer science . so far , there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s .
the &amp; k@@ demo@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ demo@@ viewer ; is an K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ demo@@ viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; kate ; the graph is re @-@ calculated and in &amp; k@@ demo@@ graphics ; shows )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; kate ; Open or open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ demo@@ viewer ; in one of the works ;
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ demo@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; required for displaying the graph .
the main window shows the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ demo@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list contains opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog File .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been changed by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph is to be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ demo@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item Settings to@@ graph viewer ; see also .
if you want to open a graph@@ ite file outside a running &amp; drag @-@ instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer , or want to display the graph@@ s to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but you can change it afterwards with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph coming to one page should be fitted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph displayed on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
the rene@@ w shop page gives you the possibility to specify the behavior when a file is changed on hard disk , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or leave the program any time .
opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ demo@@ viewer ; if a graph is opened outside of a running session , you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that every time it is asked .
the Site Management page gives you the possibility to specify the startup behavior of &amp; k@@ demo@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) the files of the last session ( or not ) or determine to be asked at any start .
the context menu , which normally appears at a click in the main window with the R@@ MB@@ n , opens further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the web page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for directed graph . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered represent@@ ations of directional graph@@ s . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge @-@ edges as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorithm is the default for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; -@@ algorithm produces a spr@@ ing@@ spring model layout for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istik , and includes a multi @-@ sensor for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm ranks the verti@@ ces circular in accordance with the description of Six and tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ end@@ at@@ ei as parameters , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms , or even modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ s ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ zed ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .

to read the K@@ IP@@ I module images provides tools to read and store new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan Pictures : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . for this , you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry pictures , a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default duc@@ um@@ he &apos;s default values to select your image . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you click the button scan the image . the estimated file size is displayed in the right lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window appears to specify the options of the target image . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore very large files created . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image .
you can create screen shots once you have selected the Import &gt; screen shot in the menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen photos :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , read the currently visible work@@ station . if you chose to read the complete desktop , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shots are waiting before it starts . if you need to switch on other desktop space , you should choose this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screenshot has been made , the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above .

the module Ex@@ ports to Fli@@ ckr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ckr server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a to@@ ken . this is used for your authentic@@ ation . thus , it is virtually your identification to Fli@@ ckr . a browser is started so that you can login to Fli@@ ckr .
after successfully regi@@ stering , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ckr web page . the following page will be presented to you after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have cli@@ cked Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ckr . this will be shown in the next section .
if the module exports to Fli@@ ckr for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which shows the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . for up@@ loading , you need author@@ is@@ ations . the module currently supports no other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button photos should be cli@@ cked once you have all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press the O@@ k button , upload the photos to Fli@@ ckr Server .
the Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the per@@ missions on your images . by default , the photos are classified as a private .
if you choose the option Modi@@ fy the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in the size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata of an image . the ge@@ ographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords in the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ px format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ one can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go up the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . in order to run a possible cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with G@@ PX file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same places at the same time as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded , an automatic cor@@ relation is carried out which shows coordinates in red . GPS tracking data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done using the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper vari@@ ance for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation is included , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ px file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the Inter@@ pol@@ ing and Differ@@ ence options can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and push the cor@@ related button to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . as the dialog itself coordinates the coordinates from one call to the next , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and placed with the indicated map . select the region and increase si@@ e.@@ Dri@@ ving this repeatedly until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely out of the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ if@@ tool to provide a pile of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums .
the tab defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each image create a page creates a gallery where the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed .
the tab record defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF @-@ information of your original images will also be saved in the new pictures .
with Other color depth , you can change the color depth . of course , it also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nail image allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press C@@ anc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if error occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as fil@@ ming , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been designed for fast image acquisition and quick access to its functions .
after the start , an image is displayed as default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below without the usual loss of quality or met@@ adata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color information takes place . for example , this can also be found in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ adata editor currently does not have any documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then select the import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the met@@ adata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check out ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide .
all images are sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . after that , you can start creating the module using extras MPEG Slideshow .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also modify the images or the contents of the list .
after you &apos;re satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning to playback the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV default PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let it black . the name and path of the generated file can be set under the name of the MPEG file file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences , you can start the production of the movie with the button enco@@ ding . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or in all rest enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you &apos;re back .
if an indication appears that co@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages using the Settings button below .
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard phot@@ og@@ lob@@ es . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct print@@ out .
this K@@ IP@@ I module lets you import or convert your images stored in RAW files into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original part of it is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first , select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the key parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ G@@ BG counter has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged image format , TIFF , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you are planning to process your pictures frequently or to use them later on , you should not choose JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the met@@ adata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion button to start conversion . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use C@@ anc@@ el to cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is useful if it was created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to convert all images into an album . it uses the convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce or increase the image .
proportional ( 1 dim . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 dim . ) : change of size in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is modified with this option .
pre @-@ press : prepare the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , margin size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images selected by you . you can add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview is shown on the right .
you can also drag images to the picture list and place them in order to add you to the list of images to be sent .
remove images from the list of images to be sent .
once you have selected all the images , you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images selected by you are attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
don &apos;t take care to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple messages if you want to send many pictures .
the email window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used every time until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must enter the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached .
the PNG format under the menu Pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted under the los@@ s@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG among pictures file format and are the original files in JPEG format , then the original extract data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so you can view the status messages , on the search for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end of the window .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL option in the presentation enables very elegant screen transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the option fil@@ en@@ ame displays the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images shown in the lower left corner during presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
the distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tional effects between which you can choose . at random each transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
while Di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you on .
with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation currently . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have received your pictures and videos with notes , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , now in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords entries are present .
in the browser window , you see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your pictures and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course viewing the actual thumb@@ nails .
if you hit people with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images are displayed on which both individuals are to be seen . this selection method allows you to restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can use it with a photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can store your own thumb@@ nail , which of course also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined . see also the picture .
to display images next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can choose which view you want to use for each category . it has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must define yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do so , you need to open the image @-@ view window ( in more detail ) and select the image editor in the context menu . in the View window , you can custom@@ ize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you call the search in the main window , a dialog will show you a dialog , which is very similar to the dialog for defining the image properties . you can view this dialog at once .
if you enter a string of characters in the label or description , the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. , for example in 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom part of the window , you can search all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user &apos;s manual for photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but rather try to try the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the scre@@ enshots and the introdu@@ ctory videos .
start &amp; use photo@@ album ; in the first dialog , select the demo , in case you start &amp; use photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry &quot; photo@@ album &quot; in the menu . then , some sample images will be loaded and you can test the functions of photo@@ album .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of the photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name implies , this strip shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can change between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can preview the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will appear in the preview pane ) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select a range , you will only see pictures of this period in the thumb@@ nail . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
photo@@ album ; provides you with two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures . the one is in and photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the integrated version will be described , which you can create via the File HTML menu ...
before HTML pages are created you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and destination . in the following , each section will be described in more detail .
first enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on the photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file should be created on the overview page . learn more about the export files in .
last@@ ly , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information displayed on the viewer is shown without description . for example , that all pictures are of a party . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide specific images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not addressed specifically .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 will not download images , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you have defined . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to higher resolution .
in this setting , place the various folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best select a root folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you must select the root folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if they really are all visible to the viewer . if you select a URL for the root folder , a web browser will start . the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . so that the import function , see , properly works you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the root folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings you have just described are related to all three basic folders and UR@@ Ls . a sub@@ folder will be created in them , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time on viewing the images , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not do again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if there is only one link to pictures in the file . the advantage of all the images to be saved in the file is that you can share all the images and share this file so independently . however , the obvious draw@@ back is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner . first , it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating HTML files will be searched . of course , this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for Export images can be described , which you can access via the File Export menu ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
in the manual , close to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with option Automati@@ cally copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; copy album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . because most of the pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the option to comp@@ ress the export file .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send images to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu import ... select , it will import and use photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the wiz@@ ard to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder import images should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ ell the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is named in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box , which categories of the import@@ ing file should be imported and which categories will match them in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported into the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will pass the various steps of ( 1 ) Deter@@ mination of information about your images , over ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced subjects and custom@@ ization options .
Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . but it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the index@@ .x@@ ml file in the top@@ most folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ male backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions on C@@ VS where you want .
photo@@ album ; remember the folder in which your pictures are saved and automatically re@@ use it for future starts . if you want to read another database in a photo@@ album , you can start &amp; use photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index@@ .x@@ ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cre@@ ate photo@@ album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu item , set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo@@ album &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the following section of the user manual will explain the different settings options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the left you see six different symbols , with which you can view setting options of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing the F1 key and a click on the option you want .
it is described in detail how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to process existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in dialogue options , you can set up entire member groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group rather than declare all groups of a member as explained .
in the drop @-@ down list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
photo@@ album ; communic@@ ates its module system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ Kam and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
the modules can be accessed via the modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of a photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules with a photo@@ album can be tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . you can either use the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible for some modules to work with a photo@@ album ; this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between the photo@@ album and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with photo@@ album .
this is simul@@ ated and photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview currently .
in addition to the current album , we have to hand over a list of albums . here &apos;s a photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you have defined in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category persons , will use photo@@ album ; so do , so if you have selected people to view it and share it with the module .
since some modules are with a photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the Settings dialog and select in the area modules which modules are to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; use photo@@ album ; start with your own images .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . below the tool@@ bar , you will see the window with which you can browse your picture database . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the entry pictures showing you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main functions of photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any image with notes . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the image was taken . you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of images . if , for example , shown on all pictures of Jes@@ per and all pictures taken in Copenhagen are included .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments by using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text field by setting up people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is the shifting of images in the list : if you have a family celebration , for example , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are pic@@ tured , you can , therefore , that the names used are moved upwards to find and assign the people more quickly .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date on the list .
if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with comments . in this case , simply click the above and back buttons which are located in the preview of the image to the right .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item add more entries at one time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you see a browser window showing the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that this is a group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the note di@@ alog@@ s context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry to a category and place it in order to make it to a sub @-@ category of this entry . attention , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you currently sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the ann@@ otation dialog by clicking and moving the boxes that form the top edges of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drag@@ ging it out of the window area .
if you have adjusted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... which offers you among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the options button ... and here then window / hide . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images , or all images in case you have no filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the thumb@@ nail size by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will appear in the image viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and select either the Rem@@ ove button or select the Edit menu in the Edit menu . now the window will display you that you can see in the picture .
photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use and use photo@@ album . you can also use images without saving you on the hard drive . of course , you have to record the images somewhere , so that we can record it in the database index . in the picture you see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is trun@@ cated is not saved on the hard drive . however , the thumb@@ nail images are present for the images 5 @-@ 9 . however , you can preview these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from folders and copy them again . so , if you would like to avoid the inser@@ tion of the CD concerned , please buy a larger disk to save all the images .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you accessible for others and click on current view lock in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the pictures that your little sister can see , inf@@ use and lock the menu item All except current view .
this allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give your little sister to your laptop , simply select the menu entry pictures , so all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password which must be inserted to un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , simply select the password in the privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . for one , all images on the hard disk and on the other can anyone who can access the file index@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves to prohi@@ bit the view of private images .
the reason you want to describe all your pictures with photo@@ album ; manage and describe hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason has a photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview , as described in .
the viewer can see you in . of course , it shows the picture , but additional information you have entered through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can easily drag them with the mouse and place it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . the pop @-@ up menu you can see below .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have downloaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the picture above and below . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . as often it loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and plus or minus . start and stop the slide through the C@@ tr@@ l ; S key .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete seat on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can enter the image in and out . to zoom in , you can zoom out with the mouse a rect@@ angle . with the minus button , you can zoom out the Plus button zo@@ oms into the middle of the image . it shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the dot key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed zo@@ oms . with the Equ@@ al button the zoom puts the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations that work with videos that work in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can view that image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and look at more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad as you look one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide pictures with features as you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can make a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in the picture you see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have set features on your images , these are available in the browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you selected , just indicate all at once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you want to display categories in the preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the character after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you can use photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can reverse your painted later .
in order to view the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the painting from the context menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not fully ma@@ stered but the documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
you can select individual objects in the object tree . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and displayed the object in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the tool@@ bar icon or select a menu item in the Insert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to enable you to select the correct position :
delete selected objects from the scene with del@@ e@@ zing either from the menu bar or from the context menu of the right mouse button .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with a fault description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly on App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes .
when you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as pres@@ etting the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render only one part of the texture ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross locally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a visibility level as a wire model . you can only display this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their level of visibility is less or equal to the chosen level of visibility in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement , or if you need another arrangement , you can set them arbit@@ rar@@ ily . you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different orders .
to anchor a window above or below an existing view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map fron@@ trun@@ ner on the top of the views .
the last possible window order is floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . in order to solve a view out of anch@@ oring , drag the starter on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the button bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the address bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor it at any place .
the current window view allows you to store window order ... save it . a dialog appears in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene you can render them ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , was &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click on Ren@@ dering icon Ren@@ dering the tool@@ bar or select the View scene menu item .
a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full @-@ quality images .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets you recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the map size you can insert the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the picture , select the cross@@ section sub@@ section and enter the image cut to render into the input fields .
in the drop down sel@@ ector quality you can select the properties used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ ctions lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; .
if a picture with just one beam per pixel is rendered , different errors can occur . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ √® @-@ pattern or scale effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and combines &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super sampling the neighboring pixels with inclusion . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive , because each pixel is constantly split up and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels is over@@ stepp@@ ing the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) will be charged additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixels are divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are individually tra@@ cked and checked for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on sh@@ atter@@ ing , change &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of the rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; diff@@ use light refle@@ x@@ ion is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the corresponding rays have not hit any object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; Pov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray image , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not the full command start of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . if error messages or war@@ nings occur when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support Source in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this includes the source code of the object in the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor , you can paste source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; likewise .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually , this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . here , set the path to your document and the version .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , height @-@ field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray libraries . if you include files that are not located in the scene file , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file appears in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the paint for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type labels .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects , such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross High detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further broken when the camera uses an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions of perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this feature gives a better approach to the proj@@ ections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the ground , a bottom is rendered under the objects . the bottom is shown in a check@@ er@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you tick Edge Control , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and threshold value can be adjusted . more details about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window orders section explains how to create and store window orders .
the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all the views for the selected window order . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
the position of the new window . with new column , create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a map view in common with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without any more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , very popular among beginners : a ball on one level .
but you should consider the following war@@ nings carefully before you compl@@ ain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pres@@ et window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing tool@@ bar icons . please read the documentation so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry Edi@@ ting Del@@ ete . now you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position .
when you press the App@@ ly button or En@@ ter key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result you see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( Insert End User Qu@@ ader ) and set the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an in@@ comprehen@@ sible method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or En@@ ter . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the layer , al@@ beit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite plane . if you render the scene , the plane extends to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree carefully , you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . the pig@@ ment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the pig@@ ment preview only shows a matte black material because you need to make adjustments for the pig@@ ment yet . therefore , always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on Preview . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the simpl@@ est .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and ball in the preview , just click the App@@ ly button and then preview .
the material for the floor is now correctly adjusted . if you click on the icon with a click now , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the colors you have expected . here are further settings necessary . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select single @-@ colored and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step you should simply execute , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; already understood . the ball is just as easy as the ground :
in the view of object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button applic@@ ator ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , as you moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering is now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already at the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment as colour :
select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere of pig@@ ment . click ball pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screen shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
the brightness effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities are you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ tracing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ tra@@ ps , the ren@@ derer sho@@ ots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam hits the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will affect .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a storage space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ ar@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not added any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . you can only select this menu item if you use edit mode .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change orders or add new ones .
opens a dialog to create tool@@ bars . you can use this option tool@@ box for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a b@@ ump map and a texture map .
base bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these fundamental bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base , by using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can choose images to display .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can display with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image is to be displayed in your own window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog Ein@@ richten - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , there are five cards of cards . in three of them , General and Mach@@ ining and Dias@@ how , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cut keys can be specified for each window .
if this is selected , the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; while preserving the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the image in the window mode , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can create &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is switched on as default .
speci@@ fies whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default setting is 3 seconds .
the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
here you can change the short@@ cut keys for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the map cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
the image size decreases by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
the image increases by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and modifications .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to at least issues and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ foto ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry reports you problems or wishes . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means users and developers are helping each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ foto ; then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; however , you may have questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto ; to participate is the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list from &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ foto ; tries to give you so much control over its work procedures as possible . there are many options to change the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto ; in order to access these settings , you need to select in the Settings show@@ photo ; the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . dex@@ ter@@ wise the colors with what you want to display in contrast stand . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side@@ bar at the right margin , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also find the same page bar in the image editing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes images to scan and store .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes images scan and store . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for any image or save images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog to choose the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and click OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options are not special .
to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then select the scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom to fit the complete preview in the window .
if the image was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview display in the settings then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you will return to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option Before saving has to be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be checked .
this setting allows them to select the type such as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images save . dialog to open for each image opens the dialog in front of each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically be saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save without having to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as default for dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can custom@@ ize the image quality used for saving . this value also changes compression value when saving . if you choose not to select the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button √úber starts the K@@ DE About -@@ Dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button Settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to termin@@ ate &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of these ab@@ brevi@@ ations and their function . the global short@@ cut lets you set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and set up Global key short@@ cut , by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and set short commands ... select .
you can set up existing multimedia buttons to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ list browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command line options ; Amar@@ ok additionally has some own command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of missing dependen@@ cies . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use the dialog to prevent the user from running a script .
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialogue --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply add them to the required features . you will quickly find that writing scripts are relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow to run external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; send noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should regularly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Exp@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . in order to save and load the setup data each script itself has to take care of . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok will set the folder to the folder where all data should be saved .
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is p@@ opped up . the script could now pick up additional information on the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example the met@@ adata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Read paths Cont@@ ains the path to the selected files of the play@@ list when a user defined menu item is cli@@ cked . to add an entry to the menu , you can use the d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ blem ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ated , or if the user stops a script sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , clean up data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok &apos;s script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the addition of amar@@ ach@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly design@@ ate your script packages .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is finished , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your listing on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily drag music into the play@@ list instead of having to browse through endless menus . perhaps you just search for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Colle@@ cting Browser and Quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
you may have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which ones you want to hear ? then the play@@ list browser is the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . in addition , many different audio systems can be used , so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to type the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be enabled or de@@ activated at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain dependen@@ cies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . for details please refer to the system requirements section .
enabled de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; set up without effort to set up the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
in addition to the play@@ list , the player window automatically switches the player window to the play@@ list . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ list window will be displayed .
use m@@ oods : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning ergometer .
design : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
put the voice files in the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar@@ .@@ If this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored on the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise , .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise , .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise , .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if a browser needs to be started .
other browsers use : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
when you exit the play@@ list , the current play@@ list stores automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running play@@ list when you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the play@@ list , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
to keep the current piece visible when the play changes , the play@@ list window will pop up / down to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
changing the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is p@@ opped up .
in the Appar@@ ition section , you can custom@@ ize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting own fon@@ ts , the otherwise gra@@ yed section is activated . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : play@@ list window , player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of Custom color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme . to do this , use the color sel@@ ector for foreg@@ round and background color .
play back when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , continue the play automatically with the piece at the position with which it was stopped at the last stop .
set up On @-@ Screen display allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is cli@@ cked , a preview of the O@@ SD will appear and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be shown in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors gives you the possibility to custom@@ ize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors are not activated , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ colors are used .
the display text input field displays the text shown in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available space holders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to determine on which screen of a multi @-@ screen environment the O@@ SD is supposed to appear .
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers still activate further settings in this card .
the Map Collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder into the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders .
recur@@ sively browse sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the infected and their sub @-@ folders to search for music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , and an incre@@ mental search will be carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the play@@ lists automatically added will then appear in the play@@ list browser .
the part of the collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , additional setup is required in the My@@ S@@ ql setup window .
the My@@ S@@ ql setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : will the machine enter where the My@@ S@@ ql database is located . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the cart@@ on card last@@ .@@ fm dire@@ cts the support for last@@ .@@ fm . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can send the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ fm server and create music recommendations for the current piece if required .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ fm profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ fm web page .
send off pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ fm @-@ Profile .
similar interpre@@ ters invo@@ ke : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar performers to the each played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ fm @-@ Profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with scre@@ enshots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . so you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . therefore , Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the tag@@ lib library for days . you can locate the file by viewing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . after that , you can also delete the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
most of the time it is because Tag@@ lib cr@@ ashes reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the tag@@ lib developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , tag@@ lib , but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this will lead to crash when processing met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable autom@@ . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many program reads data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but not as a Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags from $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random@@ ize / re@@ petition / dynamic play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten .
if you get this error : berth : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ k@@ app : Un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok will use the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version , or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first .
there are some ways . most of the installation problems are most easily resolved by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bug@@ zilla is not suitable for searching for help . please enter only one error if there is something wrong in Amar@@ ok &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problem &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only an empty play@@ list appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the user intuitive , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the statistic window . you will find it under extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , the review column must be displayed in the play@@ list . click with &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click the title list of the play@@ list and select column . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the Short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From play@@ list removed from the drop down menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse to the play@@ list and drop them there , just like you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
in the play@@ list tool@@ bar , next to the Add button , you can save the Play@@ list button . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be supporting G@@ Stream@@ er / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stream@@ er can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! maybe you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in default does not include any MP3 Dec@@ oder ( for patent rights reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter key
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously deliver audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. sb@@ live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you search for the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stream@@ er you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. that sink ) .
that does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media first need to be de@@ co@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only want to hear a white noise . G@@ Stream@@ er is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stream@@ er reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stream@@ er can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stream@@ er driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X has problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fying of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ aso@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stream@@ er or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less sus@@ pen@@ se the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , that &apos;s a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stream@@ er is installed but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stream@@ er driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ Stream@@ er , you need to register all components . run g@@ st register to record all G@@ Stream@@ er components .
read the G@@ Stream@@ er FAQ . if this doesn &apos;t help you can also ask for the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stream@@ er .
try this ( end Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then execute g@@ st register , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ config and execute g@@ st @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;re arous@@ ed by the soft tones of the music you have stopped before going to bed .
how to get to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok , if you are on another computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you an interpre@@ ter and title of the running piece : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying
replace IP address with your username and username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by pressing d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is opening in an independent window in size .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the click @-@ order sequence into the queu@@ e . by pressing the En@@ ter button after a search in the play@@ list , the first search result is played and the search is reset .
OK , the player window and play@@ list have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the section of the control bar ?
click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my Personal folder $ HOME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database can not be created and on the console many error messages appear . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ ok &apos;s MySQL support .
place the CD , then click Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , go to the wa@@ v folders , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , instead , take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically , this adap@@ ts the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has a single assessment on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece yourself by clicking the right mouse button on a column heading in the play@@ list window . there , you can modify the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by selecting the right mouse button on the piece and edit : select rating or press F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the met@@ adata dialog .
the developers do not want to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publication plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can still find anno@@ ying . disable the option icon when playing animated in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select setup tool@@ bars ... and make the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... App@@ ear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click New Design to install ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too . to avoid difficulties it was removed .

Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and a lot of error reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or g@@ Stream@@ er . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
probably you use a distribution which the development files are installed separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same is also true for x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install Amar@@ ok .
I get the error G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stream@@ er has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stream@@ er . you need to compile G@@ Stream@@ er without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : uses no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stream@@ er fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stream@@ er , G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ fa@@ ad must also install the G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ quick@@ time module .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
set up Amar@@ ok ... audio output enter the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ aso@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog , and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib looks after conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on the sound@@ card m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with arts will not be looked after further . of course , you are allowed to take this issue yourself into your hands ! if you like , you can become the new so urg@@ ently needed assist@@ ent for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the introdu@@ ctory wiz@@ ard , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or simply do not like the wiz@@ ard , then this quick start guide will help you . with its help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a play@@ list is very simple . drag items from the collection browser to the play@@ list . the small text box for fil@@ tering the collection makes it easier to search for specific pieces . if you are satisfied with the play@@ list , you can save it by using the play@@ list . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add it to the play@@ list browser . if the play@@ list is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the play@@ list option to import them , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right click on a play@@ list , you will get different ways to load play@@ list .
to play an audio CD , in the menu bar , select actions audio CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the play@@ list and then press the button playback .
the audio CD function uses the protocol audio oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burn function is also available in the play@@ list . simply press the right mouse button on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have different options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages will be listed which make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you install these packages via a pack@@ et management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; but a play@@ list that is superior to all . the play@@ list window contains multiple browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and play@@ list .
the Player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre . at the top of the window you find a running text display that displays the current piece or the current stream . just below is the area , the game time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red play time for remaining playing time of the piece .
in addition , the Player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zers by clicking the left mouse button .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fied window .
under the running text display , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also displayed . the button PL enables or dis@@ ables the play@@ list window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece position slider . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or the volume . playback buttons can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from Klassik to Tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to display e@@ quali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you tick the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the e@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced play@@ list of all available multimedia players . it has many features that there is in no other player . but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the play@@ list , such as the context browser . the play@@ list is easy to use and yet even for advanced users is powerful enough .
the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be modified with the help of context @-@ browser design . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ters . these three sub @-@ windows are later incorporated into detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information displayed there now has been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras Reports ) .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the current piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to im@@ itate the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its assessment .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be located in the same folder as the current piece . file formats .jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recomm@@ ended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpre@@ ter . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can set which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . with the right mouse button click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the play@@ list from the context menu .
in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites by using even written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if there is no text script running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is necessary .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing performer - group only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or gen@@ res are ignored .
group@@ ing performer / album - first the pieces are arranged by interpre@@ ters and among them another split is made according to the respective album . if you want to see con@@ stellation or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list below Various Artists .
group performer / year - Album - sorted by interpre@@ ters and then after the year of the album in desc@@ ending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabe@@ tically sorted among each other . the interpre@@ ter is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ ter - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them , sorted by performer .
group Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This attitude works as well as the above but is additionally sorted by album below the interpre@@ ter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can custom@@ ize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically capture your collection once you change something at the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
directly below the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes about using this filter can be found in the play@@ list section in this manual .
the search filter is a selection box that allows you to filter the most recently added pieces to your collection , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . of course , you can also select your overall collection , whereby the filter is disabled practically .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you get the following options .
load - This le@@ aves the current play@@ list and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
attach to play@@ list - Add the selected songs from the current play@@ list . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you reach the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ e - This function adds the selected pieces to the queu@@ e . thus , you will be playing next .
save as play@@ list ... - Save the selected songs as play@@ list . you &apos;ll be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the queu@@ e for transferring to the Media Player . for more details , see the Media Player browser section .
burn all pieces of this interpre@@ ter / burn to CD - Th@@ rough the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit met@@ adata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files to the M√ºl@@ lei@@ mer ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , promp@@ ting it to be different interpre@@ ters .
compilation @-@ Mark@@ ings - Change a album marked as a compilation back into a normal album . the album is then no longer displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpre@@ ter .
the play@@ list browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligence play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ list browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a play@@ list with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
also self @-@ created Smart Play@@ lists are possible . click to add Intelligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart Play@@ list . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new play@@ list .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , locate the pieces on your iPod to performer sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the play@@ list and drop them on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . thus , the pieces will be up@@ loaded to your iPod . if the transmission is complete , exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive for your iPod .
the tool@@ bar is a search area that allows you to search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not meet your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a set URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the play@@ list .
if the play@@ list is longer than in the window , the attachment of the Shift key can be difficult . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically be inserted at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the play@@ list contains all items attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired place and drop them . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters are displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again .
if you enter by whit@@ esp@@ ace separated search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that include all search terms . if you enter two three , search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) are found .
if you would like to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with some go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will include entries tagged with Mike Old@@ field , not after entries , such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variations at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and not include the commentary .
you can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then press the right mouse button in the desired order to the entries . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are re@@ produced .
the play@@ list tool@@ bar is located at the bottom of the play@@ list . it contains buttons for some functions of the play@@ list . on the left hand , you will find the Add button to add to the play@@ list . to the right , you will find play@@ list , play@@ list blank and pr@@ one mixing .
next , the buttons follow the undo and restore button . this allows you to rever@@ t or restore changes to the play@@ list .
in the center of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fiable analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you get in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example , playback controls and volume control . you can set up the buttons displayed by clicking on menu and setting up tool@@ bars ...
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the play@@ list . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total game time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and repeat performance is displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in general settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the list in the play@@ list . you can access &amp; Amar@@ ok settings via this menu .
a click on this entry will open the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the interpre@@ ter on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what to be displayed in the cover management . select :
the queu@@ e administration got your big let@@ tering in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the play@@ list . after you have set a piece in the queu@@ e , a number appears in the play@@ list next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
when you want to add a piece to the queu@@ e , select the piece in the play@@ list and then click + . you can easily add the pieces to your mouse or use the context menu in the play@@ list . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queu@@ e management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre @-@ specified ( the details to set up these follow later ) .
fills your play@@ list with random pieces from your entire collection and adds another random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ fm Recomm@@ end@@ ations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your play@@ list . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ fm Profile for this dynamic play@@ list .
double to the play@@ list you want , drag them into the play@@ list window or right @-@ click them and then select Download . in this way , your current play@@ list will be replaced by the new play@@ list . thus , you should save the old play@@ list under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes of random mix and play@@ list mix immediately fill your play@@ list and you can start playing directly . the play@@ list Recomm@@ ended pieces start with an empty play@@ list and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece of play , so your play@@ list will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current play@@ list , check the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing play@@ list as the starting point . the dynamic mode can also be disabled again via the same menu item .
the New Play@@ list will popul@@ ate the current play@@ list and add new pieces according to the dynamic mode . editing play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the play@@ list and you can change the settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic play@@ list gives you the ability to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to editing the play@@ list settings .
enter any name for the play@@ list here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your play@@ list will continuously grow , the setting for incoming pieces will ski@@ p and they will not hear a piece in this play@@ list . however , if the setting is active , the pieces already played are removed from the setting of play@@ able pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played , which are to be kept at the beginning of the play@@ list . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added after each played piece to the play@@ list . if you set more than 1 , the play@@ list will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists respectively smart play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists selected .
some scripts make your own settings . you can custom@@ ize the settings by starting the script and then clicking App@@ ly .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install Scrip@@ ts by clicking on the script . a selection dialog will open in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to ext@@ ingu@@ ish then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please see writing scripts in the writing section .
the Dialog @-@ Window Visu@@ alization Plugins is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , just enable the check box next to the name .
this quick guide will show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you can create an audio CD . to track the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 &apos;s or other los@@ ed compressed formats , remember that you will receive a bad quality when enco@@ ding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format .
in this dialog window , you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has finished burning .
this quick guide will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to copy a data CD in just four steps . to track the steps , you have to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , Cop@@ y CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
once you have made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog window , you can track the progress of the copy process . as soon as reading the original is completed in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium on which the data is to be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you need to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you need to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the wid@@ get modules ; get q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .

if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program fires audio or data CD tracks in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tar@@ nish description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ of@@ s ; : burning all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also offer &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; hence select &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; but a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet , such programs are commonly referred to as Ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ free and professional technology for audio coding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and En@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ 2 decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 En@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ nd@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ h@@ ack Dec@@ oder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible , for example , to dec@@ ryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD .
SO@@ X : an aid program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ coder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
Norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can be useful e.g. for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different record levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ happy effect that the music pieces are played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and automatically re@@ play all the videos in the root folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way of re@@ charging recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog saving under is displayed with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . that &apos;s the same as if you would call for every single project file saving .
includes the current project . if a project has been changed and not saved yet , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; what will happen . you can then choose between saving and modifications . you can also ab@@ ort the closing and keep the project open so .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any non @-@ stored project what will happen , just like you have called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and termin@@ ated &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for any non @-@ stored project you will be asked what will happen to you as if you have called a file .
when you call this entry , you can choose from the appearing dialog files to add to the project . that has the same effect as if you draw the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the basic folder of the CD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; opens the dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button Br@@ ennen , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described over the What is the ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you compile files for a multi @-@ session CD .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function does not remove files from the medium , it only blin@@ ds the previously imported files .
opens the CD Cop@@ y Dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD which you can then later burn later . you should also choose cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD Cop@@ y Dialog . this allows even without project file to copy a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later on . moreover , there is also the possibility of playing a DVD with the help of copying dialog , so the target medium has to be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this lets you delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog to format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ¬± R ( W ) so that the content will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , but you need to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will ask for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously read DVD video can be converted . this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read video , enco@@ ding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges .
this information is displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and un@@ lock the disk or disc@@ arding the medium .
the Content view allows selecting and drag@@ ging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD was selected in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key allocation for it further down .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrators are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wiz@@ ard .
opens the Settings from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should function at startup . this dialog is for person@@ alization and for fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or use the slightly more convenient K@@ d@@ co@@ p program . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so more your taste and style of your task is crucial , which of the programs you give den@@ om@@ ance .
in this chapter we assume you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for generating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) int format@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( itali@@ l ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Alternati@@ vely you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be used on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) int cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String &#91; ) &#93; void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String - ) void remo@@ ve@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String ne@@ wn@@ ame ) void set@@ vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inser@@ ts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read@@ out for &amp; k@@ de ; with it you can easily record audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der installed on the machine .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the U@@ I of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and many enco@@ ders who enco@@ ding these wa@@ v files ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) by default ( These enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . additional co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored into WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually a per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also into other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers must be installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything itself . however , only the enco@@ der packages must be installed which are needed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to co@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . in any case , &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; even do not handle the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup dialog has to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily approach to read a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is manually recorded .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the page step by step , for example , you will find more information on how this program is used , as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB query of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case must first connect to the Internet . )
start reading and - if an enco@@ der is configured in the enco@@ ding settings tab in the setup directory - the enco@@ ding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the default . it is to be noted that before the enco@@ der was configured in the enco@@ ding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already read file will be selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , ports ) for events ( such as read@@ out the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as En@@ coder , for setting up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here , you need to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can return these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important as both co@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless delivered free of charge with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality for lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets is available .
MP3 - if music should be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good En@@ ough for music of young people , portable devices and auto @-@ stere@@ os@@ ystems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi devices .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ San@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without paying attention to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information obtained manually or retri@@ eved by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be transferred / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and to create the enco@@ ding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; titles to keywords ( English : tag ) when mp@@ 3s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch @-@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ copy@@ ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wiz@@ ard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database in which people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of themselves into the calcul@@ ator . it is to note that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the CD ; information available that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; any information can be obtained from the artist or the music company . all information can be obtained anyway with a bum@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; actively select a check box . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than the one in the system . in this type of configuration , so it appears , the email address will not be used by the server when retri@@ eving the data ( This can only know the progra@@ mmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is needed . this saves bandwidth in the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually generated per month ) only the updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to save pieces from the CD ; to save into wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; those who want to know more exactly , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading Audio @-@ CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the right distribution must first be installed if this has not happened yet .
to save the read @-@ off wa@@ v files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the co@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the Linux distribution provided before the co@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . more information about co@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a enco@@ der , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ ding .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , writing and reading genuine and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio co@@ di@@ ers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envel@@ ope of the CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists of and that you own write @-@ up ( eg ; try to copy something into it using the Con@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what each trig@@ gering &amp; CD must be repeated .
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to download the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it with each reading one &amp; cd ; if once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program to read it the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , then a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of device desig@@ nations for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the Map Card General settings . here you can &apos;t do much . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be stored and entered as shown in the screenshot .
select only in case of incomplete information , so that you will be noti@@ fied when information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card Card CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop @-@ down box is easier to find a &amp; CD ; associated entry will immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be changed easily . the directory and file name will be changed with Con@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in the offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screenshot .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look after a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will function as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls bo@@ cking the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the 80 , as the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activ@@ ating the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure the / tmp / tmp directory exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously fl@@ ashing pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try yourself .
CD ; disc@@ ard out of the last piece : check this to disc@@ ard the CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you cross this , then / must the path / folder be specified in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the box is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to make something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
just enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a little long , under certain circumstances , something has to be fed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the obtained compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ cting tags to version 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of WAV files enco@@ ding simultaneously : a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to enco@@ de more than one WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as default for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
in this section is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was written in the previous section , because we are comfortable and want to pick up the &amp; CD ; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each trig@@ gering &amp; CD ;
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen photos look a bit different from that for a CD ; with successfully obtained from fre@@ ed@@ b data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually enter instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , just like in the screenshot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , then search in the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers after the Help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully obtained from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; a window is displayed and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD .
if you have selected not the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in an input field &apos; Current Title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so that you are not only happy with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
Tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help to the enco@@ der to get more information .
simply select an entry that is obviously consistent with the style of the CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the CD ; data anyway . for more information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example are to be found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second item .
the CD Edi@@ tors window will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have typ@@ ed all title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the list .
note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece into or out . make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the All Pi@@ eces on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
by clicking on the selection button to read out the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and track what runs out .
on the tab orders , click on the order window . it is located in the upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window for checking the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is shown in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message appears when you try to work with a co@@ di@@ erer you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and destination folders are not what we have typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for temporary files and destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . with powerful machines , the result is un@@ clear . the machine used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queu@@ e of the enco@@ ding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is today maintained within &amp; k@@ de ; C@@ VS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , most distri@@ butions are already included in a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to persons compiled by source files and not intended for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is correct for you :
a program that inv@@ okes many different programs has many variants of settings . it &apos;s best to read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it displays screenshot of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hi , still to read ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first @-@ time launch of the program , without any cl@@ ue as it should go on from this blank screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of program start ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? if you are reading this , probably the program has already started . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is considered the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended as the first version for a manual on the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agre@@ es with this proposal .
od@@ dly , if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; get SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it also has some features that other &amp; UNIX users don &apos;t have with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI can@@ als by high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to pull on k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( real estate or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the method used in each case .
session support . when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the l@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drop window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Play in the tool@@ bar , select the item from the menu item or press the Le@@ ert@@ aste .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played after each other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and driving back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display to change the speed . to get back the original tempo , double click the tempo LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar looks like a pressure on the button rest or selecting the menu item break in the menu , so inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . pressing the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be saved in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use Tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ nis , others use song texts and other both . some pieces have no lyrics : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can adjust which events should be presented and even better : the event type will automatically determine which one song uses , so that you do not have to adjust manually . so if you select the automatic text selection menu in the Settings menu , you will always have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify an event type , select the entries or property events from the Settings menu . the same function also includes keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files you summar@@ ize . in this section , you will see how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize . click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Cop@@ y and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can choose each of them in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . consider when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can choose the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automati@@ cally adding to the collection .
when Automati@@ cally adds to the collection , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop file ) .
if Automati@@ cally is not added to the collection , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu sequence sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song further , select the next song button , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back a song back , select the button Pre@@ dic@@ ate piece , the entry Previous item from the menu item or press the Arrow key left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click on the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesi@@ zers , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events are translated into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which conver@@ ts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and always lets a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( using your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required compositions for playing a piece .
each section may only appear , except the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . but the prerequis@@ ite for this is that each occurrence has a different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) .
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... END define key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; END define key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther key@@ map ... &quot; END define CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... END OP@@ TIONS ... END
you see that define is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TIONS ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this topic describes how the patches of General MIDI can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun for example ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot . to do this , enter the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( ri@@ fle shooting ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is meant by the term Tro@@ mmel @-@ Patch of the patch , with which each tone represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of the lines is very important , as well as its presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map tones to the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . see for example the provided key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map out some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , just make it in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 depending on the following pattern :
n is the channel which is m@@ apped to the N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will be used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option may be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions canal .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value n , this is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as can be found in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM gives a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards attempt to play two sounds up to an oct@@ ave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the Settings menu , point MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for every MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed one instrument , the kno@@ b will not shine more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , choose the channel view menu : settings
the tempo LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow down it . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , etc ; and this same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs some 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
accept , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
do not check the Automati@@ sches addition to the collection before . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default speed , double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window with my MIDI @-@ folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , just switch to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; move the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn the Automati@@ sches addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . open files
suppose you have the mi@@ di files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the Automati@@ sches addition to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to further program &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .

my thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the A@@ WE support , Mr. Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Mag@@ nus Pfeffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a bug notification or just a supp@@ or@@ tive email .
and of course , my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , you can find &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .ht@@ ml . on the homepage you can track the development , search information and view images . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM radio or an A@@ WE card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ IS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send a bug notification directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of formats supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on , as well as for playback of DVD s , VCD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE Website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User M@@ ailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is re@@ produced .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you log in , your group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ list can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; S@@ MB . the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , you must select the play@@ list from the menu and select either edit mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the edit mode is left or another group is selected without having to match the play@@ list .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during start @-@ up does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would distur@@ b the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; meet &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the directory testing / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L can be supported by &amp; KM@@ Player .
there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the intermediate storage size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the &apos; console &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player visi@@ bly .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; all must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ zilla module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even be added to the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can be played in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the configuration dialog file assign@@ ments of K@@ DE must be specified .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; S@@ MB Player ; is to start in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end issue is available within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so that always a given back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if it was determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . for this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog can be used in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b contained in it .
since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ linux extension for the X server must be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , KM@@ Player uses different names for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ou@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when enabled , they start playing the play@@ list .
is there a hint how I can qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive if I play from it ( not from the VCD / / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be run as user root after installing the device . it is absolutely safe to make sure / dev / c@@ drom drive on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts slowly , why does every time my CPU has to be checked for their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player will automatically need the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user interfaces and network support , and is needed to compile &amp; tile .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems is probably used on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , documentation of distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; K@@ ile ; project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; tile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further compile and are included on the tile ; -@@ Website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users have to hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact with the tile should be made .
if you have questions about or at compile &amp; tile ; on or if extensions wish , this should be addressed to the mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; C@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working area . &amp; tile ; provides the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . last@@ ly , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; unique ; and to experience its possibilities , the guide to Kate should be used . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start directly with the reading of the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate ; start .
f√É ¬º r &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right pron@@ unci@@ ation : lay @-@ TECH . while the ur@@ inary &amp; tex ; difficult to use can also use a laun@@ cher ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
here &apos;s just a good explanation of &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . to be able to speak correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just like other drawing languages contains &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text green e are defined as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ start { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } .
the Quick Step wiz@@ ard by &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for spe@@ edy preparation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document .
document classes : this sets the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; book &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; more &#93; , films &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : the character enco@@ ding is set . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they are only selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Brief ( DIN ) : the document classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users do not have to worry about . it is merely a short description of the functions and further information about this is given in the section .
&amp; C@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; tile ; if you see green areas of a green text on the screen , it is likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed . however , you have noticed it by the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless .
with automatic completion of the environments , by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; tile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for input of the text ) and the added line to the closing of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the Men@@ √É ¬º Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the document to be divided into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI file is created , navig@@ ating &amp; tile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI , viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source .
a DVI / file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as font and is beside PDF the usual output ear@@ t of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and print from DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the reset search , the elements of the DVI @-@ file are plug@@ ged with the editor and once on an element in the DVI @-@ file . the default search is the exact opposite of it . once you cli@@ cked on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source text cli@@ cked at the appropriate place in the DVI , viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set for project project settings .
quick cultivation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless errors are available in the source code ) .
‚Ä¢ File surveillance : in this mode , the DVI @-@ file is built on un@@ plug@@ ged forec@@ ast@@ √¢ ¬¨ settlements and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction .
when viewing the edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection boxes should be noticed . the selection fields were developed for the fast introduction of common elements into the document . the first drop down box is for quick breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ f√É ¬º g@@ baren &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ector is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , fuel notes , or references . the available possibilities are : &quot; &quot; &quot;
name : this command creates a name for a section , an image or other element .
cover : used for reference to a specified term ( selection over a selection field possible ) .
when using quot@@ ation a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can of course also be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; by hand .
the last drop down sel@@ ector with the name Gr@@ √É ¬∂ √É ¬∂ is is used for defining the font size . it can be specified for the main text , the gro@@ u@@ des , etc . it contains the following letters to be used :
when calling &amp; K@@ ile , there are two options available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason on hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to do this is the use of the men@@ √É ¬º s construction or the Kn@@ op@@ fs Schnell@@ bau .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; C@@ ile ; it exec@@ utes the storage automatically .
if the document comp@@ iling fails , it should be searched after the errors . when using quick construction , the ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font green e 12 is created and only a few places should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ huge and \ \ end { environment } has then created the arrangement of the fon@@ ts within the environment .
the changes are noti@@ fied only within the environment ( of \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , there may be certain fon@@ ts , gre@@ ase pressure , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either using the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics and is valid as long as it is closed by a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be displayed recur@@ sively with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quot@@ ation begins with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ drawing language is shown , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; .
once in the wiz@@ ard a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . this should include a quote , a few places in fat and ital@@ ics and a poem for the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . an external viewer has to close the window .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI @-@ file , the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed using file print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar enables the transformation of the DVI @-@ file into other formats . once the DVI @-@ file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source text , the conversion into unwanted other formats can start using the tool@@ bar .
the default search allows direct jump from the editor to the added position inside the DVI @-@ file .
&amp; C@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this , only Modern should be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... tools construction will be selected .
in order to perform the pre @-@ order search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a row of the source text and cli@@ cked on pre @-@ order search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI , viewer takes place .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; open and ski@@ pped to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; C@@ ile ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; set up as text editor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if the &amp; DVI connection is using , an error can be found . if an error is present , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the logging file att@@ aches the source of errors in the source code . in the editor , the sy@@ slo@@ ps predi@@ ctions and mistakes can be used for j@@ umps between errors . the log file always gives the line where the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty line , the error must be cli@@ cked on the error in the logging and &amp; C@@ ile ; j@@ umps to the faul@@ ty line .
once the button is cli@@ cked on the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to choose the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et possibilities are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard for quick creation of a new document . for more information , please refer to the section .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be written in &amp; tile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or create a new file . &amp; C@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a new file , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in settings c@@ ile ... settings General are set .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SSO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ : this string is replaced by typ@@ ing in the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SSO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the simpl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way , the following steps have been completed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created in a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the internet and can be performed under described steps .
&amp; C@@ ile ; uses &amp; works ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and empha@@ si@@ zing many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; kate ; can be made in the Men@@ √É ¬º Tools straight out &amp; tile ; out .
to learn more about &amp; unique ; and to experience its possibilities , the guide to Kate should be used . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can begin directly with the reading of the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate ; start .
&amp; C@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be inv@@ oked by the Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; that means that clicking \ \ par \ \ \ \ big@@ ski@@ p will only be selected \ \ par by \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p .
when drag@@ ging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed SHI@@ FT key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; C@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the different types of source texts and emphasize them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can incorporate additional spr@@ inkl@@ ing brands . this is their own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu entries do jump on br@@ anding or the corresponding key@@ note mark . this is also highlighted by this jump @-@ mark , so that it is automatically logged in the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; tile ; although &amp; kate ; already outstanding possibilities offered , have been added in &amp; tile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection .
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands and all other lines of the source code . the only preventive matter in &amp; K@@ ile ; is that the scor@@ gins are separated by two blank lines .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a back @-@ line @-@ line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be initially selected and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; kate ; offers the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; C@@ ile ; offers with own commands here for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands are included to delete the text :
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; tile ; is included in the description to edit the he@@ aters paragraph .
it has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; tile ; for more commands under Edit Sur@@ ro@@ undings for one possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command you will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to lock the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , is inj@@ ected to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many w@@ ax@@ ed environment commands , the √É ¬π s view can quickly be lost . this command locks the last environment , so that the ch@@ ased surrounding structure is not dist@@ orted .
&amp; C@@ ile ; also offers special commands for &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that match those from editing environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly cl@@ amped cl@@ asp .
if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly cl@@ asp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , is inj@@ ected to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
during the input of many w@@ ax@@ ed braces bon@@ ded brackets can quickly get lost sight of . this command locks the most recently opened group , so that the ch@@ ased structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be torn apart .
in &amp; lat@@ ex , two simple quotes are used as g√É ¬§ n@@ se@@ am . for the purpose of the implementation is used in &amp; tile ; the character is used for two simple quotes .
this automatic inser@@ tion of double attachment marks can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
you can also use foreign @-@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and there@@ with German or French quotes . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift , En@@ ter &amp; C@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( such as enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; C@@ ile ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a sp@@ read@@ sheet area integer t &amp; K@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjacent new@@ line break .
even better - &amp; tile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X will be added .
some users want to classi@@ fy the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all Et @-@ sign ( amp ; ) among each other . when pressing Shift , Alt ; amp ; search &amp; tile ; after the next tab@@ ulator in the above line . although this tab is not the added , for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; kate ; already offers a good source code complete , it has been added to &amp; K@@ ile ; for special orders ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three are installed for automatic completion . all these modes can be set for different modes of operation under Settings K@@ ile ... fully adjustable .
starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } will &amp; c@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to set up the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be smaller by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be frozen when selecting a command . alternatively , ski@@ pping marks can be frozen , so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible by means of machining marks , and the required parameters can be set .
under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... tile ; all settings can be made to these lists . there can be different W@@ √É ¬∂ r@@ ter@@ listen for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ instructions as well as W@@ √É ¬∂ r@@ ter@@ b√É ¬º cher of the general language range are selected .
the command mode is not necessary for ful@@ fillment of environments . a few letters with \ \ begin should always be entered and the execution mode is called a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are often used to provide a special mode for understanding the environment .
when invo@@ king the ful@@ fillment Mode to the ful@@ ler environment or the key @-@ key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically set and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and termin@@ ate by pressing the input button .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; K@@ ile ; realize that it is a listing area , even a first \ \ item command will be frozen .
under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... tile ; all settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ √É ¬∂ r@@ ter@@ liste des ver@@ f√É ¬§ n@@ digungs@@ mode f√É ¬º r &amp; tex ; - und &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands .
&amp; C@@ ile ; supported user @-@ defined lists of queries that are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... c@@ ile can be set up . as an example of a storage list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L entered and the word processor mode is initiated by the Edit Sett@@ lement or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt Emp@@ t@@ aste , the character L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large @-@ scale W@@ √É ¬∂ r@@ ter@@ b√É ¬º cher are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been noted that many W@@ √É ¬∂ r@@ ter are written in a document more than once .
this mode can be set up in the C@@ ile menu ... tile ampli@@ fiers can be s@@ worn down . here too the threshold for displaying the completion can be specified .
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / patches / complete / mode / of the Persian Home folder . mode is for ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ √É ¬∂ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the dialog graphics are designed to capture graphics as easy as possible . to verify the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered and respected .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and re@@ arrangement of pages . if the PDF output is installed , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
in order to be able to examine the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the Men@@ √É ¬º s create compile , create transform@@ ations and create view .
for the compilation of the source code for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the key@@ word Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI @-@ file can be used in the standard viewer using Alt ; 3 , by means of Alt ; 4 the DVI @-@ file is converted into a PS file and by using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Schnell@@ bau command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , each time a new window will open .
a new project becomes the Men@@ √É ¬º Project New Project .... here the following information is asked for the project :
when filling the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; K@@ ile ; allows the exec@@ uting of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be administered by scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; K@@ ile .
first , it must be said that the implementation environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = tile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a well established system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; C@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . this includes a documentation for the pack@@ ets contained and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
it is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather a complete instruction manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; tile ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ til@@ t , which contains a database with all the available documents and for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the green advantage is the search for package names or stro@@ kes . by &amp; K@@ ile , only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or pressing the space button opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; K@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor that can be used on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; work space . &amp; C@@ ile ; is also part of the Fink project , which makes &amp; K@@ ile ; also available on &amp; Mac ; installed with installed OS @-@ X .
many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the continu@@ ance of the &amp; K@@ ile ; -@@ project and offer for many hours for the development of tools we all can use under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; current information about the contribut@@ ors is available in the Help Firm .

&amp; c@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different sig@@ natur@@ es for e @-@ mails . you can edit sig@@ natur@@ es in the graphical user interface of &amp; cool ; with the command line interface , you generate random sig@@ natur@@ es or day sig@@ natur@@ es from a list . this command line interface provides the sig@@ natur@@ es for external e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random sig@@ natur@@ es , any signature from the signature file of &amp; c@@ sig is read . by many sig@@ natur@@ es with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails diverse and unique .
for daily sig@@ natur@@ es the same signature is derived from the signature file of &amp; c@@ sig ; for each day use different sig@@ natur@@ es , as with the random sig@@ natur@@ es you create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you a lt ; empty sig@@ natur@@ es ; in the sig@@ natur@@ es section . by entering the signature sample Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file save or click on the disk icon Save .
you can create as many sig@@ natur@@ es as you like . then you have a list of sig@@ natur@@ es for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; if you use e @-@ mails private or professionally , there are always plenty of sig@@ natur@@ es .
to delete a signature , first select it and remove it from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross in the tool@@ bar .

the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; laugh , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plugin system will take advantage of immediately and don &apos;t have to wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements . more about it below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a Part , we start editing plug@@ ins with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all contained plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this is done by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold according to which you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of their own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team there is another benefit from the collection of members of the team : it can be created an event for information on team leaders when something particular happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens in the project . one example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone was working on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into the C@@ VS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the site Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the addres@@ see selected in the recipient list . addres@@ s@@ able can be a team or sub@@ project manager . see how such conductors are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
input notes is simple . you can either select the comment entry from the Editor context menu or input the @ ann@@ otation key word in a comment field followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , with nick@@ name of the assigned nick@@ name of the team member , should be given the appropriate domain or sub @-@ project leaders as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles @-@ names are independent of b@@ ump@@ y caps , but spaces around brackets and : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ t- and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D agnos@@ tic ist and web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by Settings Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags , including car complete , it can be changed . the entries are :
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional Tags automatically close : if checked , for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this is immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and finish tag automatically update : when switched on , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of ac@@ cent@@ u@@ ated characters into the corresponding enco@@ ding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using button Standard , the default specifications can be restored .
standard character enco@@ ding : the coding of newly created files or in a different way than with open open file ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting will be sto@@ cked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
default DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been recognized . however , this setting will be removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that during the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even for not stored documents , a backup is created regularly , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset the window settings to default when the next start is useful when the user interface changes through modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / dependen@@ cies on each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning messages range is used to control the control of warning messages through hooks of non @-@ demand .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in divided mode . regarding the different modes , see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser k@@ not in the document , can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the field of structural tree settings , the visibility of knots in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in a change of the structure tree will be automatically opened . empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those with which no item has been found in the current document .
the area for setting ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that are un@@ folds when editing to larger text . ab@@ brevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ cl@@ ause ab@@ brevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug@@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following should be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a default location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be transferred to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Read @-@ only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin ref@@ uses the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the load if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct , you can choose to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubles@@ hooting was completely re @-@ developed . support for the non @-@ needed built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was dis@@ continued , as well as support for the D@@ BG de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implement@@ ations via plug@@ ins .
currently only a plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ts .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it shares the plugin to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it does not have to be respected .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the noise according to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to launch a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request will be displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
instru@@ cts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continually send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this happens before a de@@ bu@@ ck is started , the script starts with the request .
instru@@ cts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution will continue . if this happens before a de@@ bu@@ ck is given , the execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next script in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next script in the script , where possible in functions and include in the script .
tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the directive and go to the next one as if there were not the current ones .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .

&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the Script Langu@@ ages and / CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folder contain two file types , the tag folder and tool@@ bar .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing DT@@ D .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the tag shows . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
tag files are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare if they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but an element type about itself otherwise .
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
returns the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a pattern name and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , that means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that groups the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be present for each field in dialog ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; what@@ s@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools Dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to start window and select Tag@@ X@@ M@@ L. dialog . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check is performed only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
in the following example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Do@@ ct@@ ype tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ TYPE = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for re@@ achable via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = sol@@ sti@@ ce 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D indication . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name will be used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... to be created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the key brevi@@ ation assigned to this action . by clicking the Custom button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be inserted a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text will be inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; themselves are the quick@@ start dialog or the various See in ... A@@ ctions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script at the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we have replaced the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document file , file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text will be added to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the drop @-@ down box , input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be diver@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the default output ; error messages , written to the default output . it can be specified , what should be done with the text written to the default output , by setting the output box output :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , there are not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the tag .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to specify actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window will start editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the matching tool@@ bar .
complete all and , if the day attributes has attributes and you plan their use , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog box when available so that you can enter the action when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . choose from &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other Progra@@ ms ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edi@@ ting size to others .
please note that the created symbol is not only helping you remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol is &amp; lt ; start ; tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must still be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so it is still there , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview . open the tool@@ bar to set the tool@@ bar dialog . make sure the tool@@ bar you want is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator supports the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by sample of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
if Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please custom@@ ize &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that your tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language that you like best . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; check if someone has already done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for the documentation HTML files e.g. php@@ 42 / # items in the main index Top element = your description for these document@@ ations , e.g. , Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = func@@ e.@@ html Tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tags 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tags 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tags
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation thus something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .ht@@ ml ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub @-@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the cart@@ on boots ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and log@@ ically shown at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files are replaced .
the portion section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP , the documentation for the mysq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is indicated . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ able resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or anyone else . at different locations there is an E @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , send the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scrip@@ ted tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ users can download them . the contributions are checked and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . to make an waff@@ le , we recommend to sign the resources for what it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this will ensure the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private g@@ pg key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the New resource dialog , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be up@@ loaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool@@ bar tool@@ bars , and start in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature . in case of problems , it war@@ ns and it can then be ab@@ orted . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the statement of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in the tag@@ XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file using the DT@@ D description which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folders .
! Do@@ ct@@ ype Defini@@ tions line : the string that is in ! Do@@ ct@@ ype Tag , such as HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . to understand and understand the full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ arise themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them closer to these concepts without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little use would bring .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all that is marked global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then are available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development agents for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , making the common use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the building man@@ sions , the map files with information and the tool@@ bar .
you can click the fl@@ ash@@ tra@@ ys with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document &apos;s current document , re@@ charge , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of C@@ VS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor area lead to another contex@@ tual menu with respect to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tags representing under the mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file if the string is called a file under the mouse cur@@ sor .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , click on the tag that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in various fields in a dialog .
the Bau@@ man@@ sichten ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; navigate , open and browse through . in the presentation with map files are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation building views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu that was displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; Every@@ thing is open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on what connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates are only available for the relevant user and templates in projects .
here you can find information about the scrip@@ ting languages available . the concept of spin @-@ off in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the information available to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is set in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ h of the tree will open .
this tree appears among the other buildings . with it you can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application @-@ oriented entry system allows you to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and viewed project specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two wa@@ iters at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all modifications to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
die &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them to a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you get a tool@@ bar in an email , you can back it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H is located in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while striving to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able Mark@@ up Language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why developers , what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ old is not only possible but allows users and developers to expand , as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows Web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the G@@ PL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details go with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta run ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as M@@ anti@@ a am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located where the oldest entry is taken .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; exp@@ ul@@ sion , so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; exp@@ ul@@ sion , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to or from . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages exist !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
exit and turn off the problem rep@@ orter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem rep@@ orter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the tool@@ bar on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set Book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this lets you copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be set by settings actions ... to be added . tool@@ bars will be saved using tool@@ bar tool@@ bars or you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar .
remo@@ ves a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do so .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new E@@ Mail message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where anyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or someone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refres@@ h the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refres@@ hed without rene@@ wing the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and does not exist in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag setup dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or dis@@ ables the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting the tool@@ bar is refused if this day contradi@@ cts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu items mentioned above . click on it . click on an activated plug@@ ins de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available origin schem@@ ata depends on the original version ; -@@ Version .
sel@@ ects the type of line ending identification . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by using the external application ti@@ dy .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching times may sometimes need time or cause unpleasant graphics . recommended is the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode which matches the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog affect every application using the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate , you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or which you can add and modify the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse cur@@ sor , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled up from above down@@ wards , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name file , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without blan@@ ks with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine you want to access , except you process local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or entire folders .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . in case of ser@@ vers@@ ed scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed in a different way .
allow files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started ane@@ w , not hooks .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection of man@@ ners .
this displays a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project project properties in the sub @-@ window profiles or changed using the key Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , even files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can read more about project views .
this allows you to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button . in this case , troubles@@ hooting is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile , by creating a custom built @-@ in view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration window , one can turn event actions and add these actions , change or delete events . event actions are executed when a specific event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at the moment .
to open another project , select project open ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project opens and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , however , the entries are missing and opened with ... in the right @-@ click on @-@ button context menu :
here you can find different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loaded files . see .
enables removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is stopped to prevent removing .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten in the program window . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk will not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many upload profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply del@@ eting the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars are available in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; preferably using the tool@@ bar menu . use and addition distinguish . the addition of tool@@ bars is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
tool@@ bars and symbols can be configured either using context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the tool@@ bar ) where new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bar ren@@ aming or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be displayed in the dialog where actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action shown that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up menu tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for connecting . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; basically uses templates like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any directory existing on the system into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in roughly the restrictions placed on the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use .
bin@@ aries are all that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually included in documents via links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , special documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in a corresponding way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the stor@@ eh@@ ouses under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this type of templates is useful , if not a new document is to be inserted in the document based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
design a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save As local template ...
once that is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template save sel@@ ections as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drag@@ ged with drag &amp; drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : just copy the file into a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag &amp; drop or past@@ ing over the Con@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project file tree view to create a name for the template and secure it . by default it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
project templates provide a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can submit head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically connect with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep a few things in mind when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates .
to specify the behavior of a folder , click the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is finished when el@@ ong@@ ated attributes has been inherited .
this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts for everything except the root folders in the Template table . if a root folder would be configured it would generally disable templates in this path unless they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
this could be general he@@ aders and foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying of content templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( point , press right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor , which can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the editor window in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL . editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and switch back to source code editor in which the changes made in the V@@ PL are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document called &amp; PHP , a small green symbol indicates the V@@ oh@@ and@@ default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL . to edit &amp; PHP , the source code is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes in the source text editor and the V@@ PL are visible , and the cur@@ sor is activated in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL . with pressing F@@ 9 , this mode is active , the push @-@ button puts the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL and the source code editor is configur@@ able via Settings Qu@@ anta . after selecting V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast calcul@@ ators and a large span for slow .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , tools document properties can be selected . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL . this is used to reduce the h√§n@@ dian enco@@ ding . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows the change of the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is possible just as with the met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is not currently supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cur@@ sor is possible like in a word processor , because of the arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted by means of a button or removal button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . it is to note that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when a anchor tag , enclosed with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars like the table wiz@@ ard or the list wiz@@ ard are de@@ activated . you will later work in the V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for examination of style sheets . unlike other style sheets programs , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style sheet can be followed .
to be able to compile successfully , except &amp; k@@ de ; the libraries lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t , li@@ be@@ x@@ sl@@ t and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are available for a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .
content in a template , in a place in a style or x@@ ml file , or at the current node . new in x@@ sl@@ db@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , possible stops can be set in a specific file and line number and be activated later .
x@@ sl@@ db@@ g retri@@ eves the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path name . file names in the same folder as the upper@@ case file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . for example loaded a style sheet file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ sl , the following input is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a template named my@@ ME or a given model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template agre@@ es with every my@@ QNA@@ P@@ cloud that contains the string template .
every nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ sl : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a desired stop must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically done when loading the first template by x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . stops will be checked again shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

on systems with an installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can use the arrow keys on / off through the expi@@ ration of the previously executed commands .
several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument , a stop in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that exists only from the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name such as &quot; x@@ sl : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the rec@@ ess at many places . another progra@@ mmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when mer@@ ging .
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to compare quickly text , just copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made much work was the same and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently from one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screenshot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at folder merge :
&amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more anger when somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red Color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , then you can make the typ@@ ing work easier by simply typ@@ ing the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 -@@ o Ziel@@ folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 folder
open dialog provides the manual typ@@ ing of file names , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . open dialog will notice your selection and display it next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed .
via the Fol@@ der folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge of folders will be initiated . if you select a folder , for B and C , however , a folder then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders .
if mer@@ ging is checked , the input field is active for goal and can be processed . however , it is not strictly necessary to set an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board to the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the open dialog , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the C@@ anc@@ el button .
you can also use drag &amp; drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how much these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you just need to create two related files , load them into &amp; co @-@ 3 ; now , you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : at present , you cannot remove anything from &amp; co diff@@ use ; only the drop from text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag &amp; drop of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest a while above the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed over the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one sees the color that differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that is good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare single cases . )
the vertical line separ@@ ating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no rows . if the line break is activated , the line is scored points dotted lines .
the result window ( below the comparison window ) also has a info line with the inscription : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; edit &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown . this group will also be the current group . it will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic mer@@ ging or manual machining ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and you may choose another source . this text will not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if selecting the sources ignore the options Num@@ bers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navig@@ ating mainly with the pictures and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click on one of the windows you can use the arrow keys on the left , right , high , down , side , side down , beginning , end , Str@@ g @-@ start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the Insert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in section merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture A@@ way / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture Ab@@ w√§rts ) or to the next / previous / un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the mark@@ ings to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Insert ) . there is also the option selection automatically copy . if this is checked , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and manually copied . be careful with this option because you might over@@ ride the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line ends are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line ending of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved when you exit and restore the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences will be displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen ty@@ pe@@ face does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered ast@@ ert . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically create an un@@ processed colour .
when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab@@ ulator button . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
when you press input or return , the entry of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy into the cli@@ p@@ board will then drop .
you can select which line end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used option on the operating system used .
when comparing files try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all fully identical lines are found in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters will not be ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return number &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , and other in turn only save a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually , the risk returns are made visible , but as a white sign may be dealt with . during mer@@ ging this option has to be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
in the default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensively searching for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic re @-@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is spra@@ yed .
trig@@ gers automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important . if you do this only from time to time , then use better the functions W@@ √§h@@ le A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu .
these options are discussed in the chapter on scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . check for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version is attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ original . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need &amp; co @-@ diff@@ use ; stop and rest@@ art to make the change active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global over the control center . )
the following enco@@ ding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
over the selection boxes for the enco@@ ding appears a short notice of what the local code is . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the enco@@ ding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different enco@@ ding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to specify the enco@@ ding output of pre @-@ processing commands .
switch on this to supp@@ ress changes in white characters in text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color @-@ enco@@ ded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will appear next to the normal still a second over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just stop the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the comparison window next to each other or above . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
sometimes consider the differences and then decide un@@ expect@@ edly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge operation , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first be given to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that meets your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only at the line interval . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to allow users more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient .
use this command for line input to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ) . \ \ U conver@@ ts the text found in upper@@ case letters .
C@@ VS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ key@@ word generated text $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experim@@ enting with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they &apos;re very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line spac@@ ing . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 345@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ very sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / release / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Ho@@ wever , some details are different at per@@ l . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for the display and for mer@@ ging . the other operations only change the data that the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ gleich al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus sees .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the sequ@@ encer pre@@ processor looks for the output of the standard processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hide differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge the entire folder recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can custom@@ ize the proposal before starting ,
... can simul@@ ate mer@@ ging and shows the simul@@ ated changes without really performing it ,
... exec@@ utes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and merge of individual files . you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder was specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders only the files that were compared to that date will be listed .
when scanning the folder is finished , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold up a folder by double @-@ clicking on + / - or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu includes two functions All sub @-@ directories and fold up all sub@@ directories with which you can open up all folders .
if you double click on a file , the file comparison will start and it will appear a comparison window .
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the mer@@ ging action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as shown in the picture above , the column A / B / C uses red , green , yellow and black .
for identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered as identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red becomes .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the synchron@@ izing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified and if the option di@@ synchron@@ ize directories is active . then select &amp; co @-@ diff@@ use ; then select the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied directly after merge &amp; co @-@ diff@@ use ; B by A. )
if two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge ( uns@@ af@@ e ) is checked , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different but the same date appears , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical ..
while mer@@ ging , one file is executed after another . the status column shows Fer@@ tig when mer@@ ging was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if mer@@ ging is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Tag@@ lib will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only shown if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odd ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the mer@@ ging actions ( including in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , C is used as a destination in the Three @-@ folder merge mode , when it is selected as a target for a two folder merge , and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B will be used as a target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : start / continue directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to create only the current entry , select action of the current element , or press F@@ 6 .
if the conf@@ lic@@ ting file types still exist invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears that points to the er@@ ron@@ eous elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window will display the options through , simul@@ ate and cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screenshot ) .
once you are finished with a file , select / continue directory mer@@ ging / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then execute &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to remove the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , let &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before you continue with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and does not merge them again at the later merge of all entries . even if the mer@@ ging has been ski@@ pped or not stored , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( set up Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid Plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by C@@ VS . many aut@@ op@@ tically generated files are ignored by C@@ VS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set specifically with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hidden attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous point is marked . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
when the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links will be treated as normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not examine possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder of a link on itself would lead to a final loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays statistic columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ resolved , non@@ - white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files that do not contain any text . ( specify a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security . please use caution . this option is dep@@ rec@@ ated in default .
similar to the date of change . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered to be identical if they are equal to size . this can be useful e.g. when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is dep@@ rec@@ ated in default .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected , so that after both folders are identical . also , the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , copying the newer file as an action is proposed . ( this is considered in@@ secure as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is ren@@ amed and gets the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file already exists with the .@@ original extension it will be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal merge of individual files , not just the merge entire folder . this option is enabled in default .
normally the folder merge view will remain visible during the merge of individual files . if you don &apos;t want to , you can shift the list &amp; text box to the main window in the window menu and switch between the list &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu item . you can also directly merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder merge . to do this , use the Current file merge from the merge menu .
however , this status will be lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Tag@@ lib uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished from displaying a link to a file or folder . then a file is always assumed as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date depend on the original . ( note the option Trust of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose in use is currently available as differences viewer in K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ ord display from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; co @-@ diff@@ use ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a Part , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; suppose that the input file is a patch file in unified format . at least one of the two files must exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is performed , it only supports compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now called Komp@@ are ) are already available . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 suggests that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using G@@ PL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or are going to go like that .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably did not tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure installed configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ ui@@ .@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as iden@@ tically ; however , if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not iden@@ tically . if related lines appear next to each other , this actually is coinci@@ dence but this album is often the case .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it finishes . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to design extra a separate file format that could store this information .
the effort required has been too large so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger volumes of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system ; use the following command in the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems with compile . however , if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists of it .
cut out ( Str@@ g @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . paste ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ Insert ) insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current selection .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the update function after changes to these options . )
it will also show that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merged . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to choose the source with the let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
in default this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , finish them or move them . this works both inside a working area as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ space as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only displays the two entries . if , however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . if , however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas .
when this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual work@@ space are displayed .
cross this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is checked together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1. place of work .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . otherwise only the empty fields are displayed to enable their selection .
simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window will be determined : classic lets &amp; p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , appear as from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizont@@ ally and vertical row , which is very good for displaying on the side on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set the switch to switch ... the dialog will appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent@@ Mode and assign it to a value . possible values are :
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

this application is interesting for various users : artists , web designers and people with visual imp@@ air@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; ki@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions . it is optimized for use on performance @-@ sensitive machines .
when you use &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is a magni@@ fied area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window in the following .
in the default setting , &amp; ki@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor as a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; to show a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the environment of the mouse cur@@ sor at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting of the mouse cur@@ sor . please note , that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse cur@@ sor . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and post@@ p@@ one the contents of the magni@@ fication window . this also works with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you push the &amp; Shift key , or use the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the drop @-@ down window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it into a file , copy into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
starts or stops the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode a selection window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your default sub@@ commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , new@@ com@@ ers ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlar@@ ging and cr@@ ushing &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag is also known as &amp; magni@@ fier ; it is a screenshot . you can magni@@ fy and magni@@ fier ; to do this , use a magni@@ fier area to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people from research or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click once the mouse cur@@ sor per@@ si@@ sts for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and those of every mouse click p@@ ains pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click once the mouse cur@@ sor per@@ si@@ sts for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and those of every mouse click p@@ ains pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , the mere reason of mouse pain may cause pain . if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to clarify it once again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain arising when you click with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and execute a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly .
if the smart move is enabled , power &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it emul@@ ates the mouse button . now move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . this way you can drag the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly .
this setting time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if the mouse button is switched on , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . after shut@@ down the mouse button wa@@ its before it takes the mouse button again if no result of the mouse occurs .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click through mouse displac@@ ement . if this function is enabled , a slow moving leads to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . this moves will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time it is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k ; move to sh@@ orten the reaction time . to do so , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; start . this feature is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last press release .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent post@@ p@@ one should be switched off at first . if you are ac@@ custom@@ ed to the automatic mouse click , you can later increase the intelligent move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first , you should be aware at which places a mouse click stays without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not show a link leads to un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty easy . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first , you need to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the wheels . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can be scra@@ ped easily with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . if you are using the intelligent slide in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want to have it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of desktop when you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent post@@ p@@ one , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very well possible in this way to mark text , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and then insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse at pressed mouse button . however , you will probably have problems first . here are some ad@@ vices :
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , each time you play &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when it comes to intelligent shifting the shooting time begins . later , you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool to use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed . that should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker , and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button shortly after the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor per@@ si@@ sts . this program has been developed for people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome and the operation of the m@@ igh@@ ti@@ est pain prepar@@ es .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a pulling process begins before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag@@ ging and laying with the mouse can also be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can select phrases that are spoken once again from a list of the conversation history .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that is later used for the voice output of text . for more details , please refer to the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text@@ book . from the text pass@@ book tab@@ s you can often choose text passages without having to type them . text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ boar@@ der . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the single words . in addition , you can balance the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the Wor@@ ter@@ age .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sets ( the lower white field in the screenshot ) and a course memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; correctly set up , you can enter the phrases you want to hear in the input field . each spoken phrase is attached to the expi@@ ration memory . you can select from it phrases that are to be spoken once again .
with the menu entry preferences k@@ mouth ; setup ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog includes two cards , voice output and settings , page Wor@@ ter@@ ization as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the fl@@ ash@@ card speech output , you enter the command for the inv@@ ocation of the language generator . in the drop down field below the input field , place the character enco@@ ding , with which text is passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the check box if the text remains unchanged as default input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be given as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your voice generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
being used as language service is &amp; k@@ mouth ; as a first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first drop @-@ down sel@@ ector action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text pass@@ book book or in the bar for text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays .
with the selection of Instant Mess@@ ages , the selected text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the memory memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered only into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down window of the editing window for text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays you can specify whether the text pass@@ book book should be automatically saved when closing the processing window .
when you select a text pass@@ book book , the book will be saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ book book will not be saved . select before saving queries , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book book should be saved .
the page of the Wor@@ ter@@ boar@@ der contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the short@@ age . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box indicates if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box you can select the currently used dictionary for the word @-@ end .
with buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the single words is simply determined by number of occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks what dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you set up a new , empty dictionary without entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , you create a dictionary with your voc@@ abul@@ aries over time .
the main area of the window for processing text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays is divided into two . in the upper part , the text pass@@ book strings are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pass@@ book , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books either over the selection in the menu bar , tool@@ bar or a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the process memory .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the course memory .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sentences of the default memory .
if this menu item is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is ordered by default with the editing window directly below the menu bar . by clicking on the sh@@ ading left @-@ hand side and drag@@ ging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu item is checked , a narrow strip in the bottom part of the main window with references to the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; shown if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu item is checked , a sliding bar for text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly below the tool@@ bar via the editing window . by clicking on the sh@@ ading left @-@ hand side and drag@@ ging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
probably you do not have the command for voice output right or not fully entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and specify the command for voice output on the card menu . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for more details . )
Festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival for free and to spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory . the command for voice output is :
Free@@ TTS is a written in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it supports only the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ TTS free of charge and to spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ TTS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ quet folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following commands :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ TTS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows MB@@ RO@@ LA to use free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ f ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data must be switched on as default input .
the voice output da@@ emon of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use dict@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page that appears in the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for the voice generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who can &apos;t speak , output text by the computer . a list of already spoken phrases can be saved , which the user can always leave new editions .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer you have to install a voice syn@@ thesizer .

&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module consisting of modules that allows any application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( TTS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programm@@ ers ready to use their applications with TTS features . users also offer interesting possibilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; kate ; even if &amp; kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications embedded .
the speech output is done via the program speech @-@ pat@@ cher , which uses various background programs such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables the creation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .
in ZU@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible window , the TTS @-@ Services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor , and is therefore unique ; with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ zilla @-@ database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can subscribe to the list via htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ tags . the developers can also be found in the IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ level ) .
before you can use it , you need to install and correct speech @-@ speech @-@ speakers . see also
at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card reader is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the map card is displayed .
most TTS syn@@ thesi@@ zers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . they should also set up multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise the program speed Dis@@ pat@@ cher will otherwise use the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the map Le@@ aders Spe@@ aker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card reader is displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and not yet another speaker is set up .
all already established speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not present a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the list of speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops .
select a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a male and female voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the map of the map . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; almost use it . go back to the map and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is checked so that the TTS @-@ Dienst von &amp; k@@ de ; starts . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; click on the map orders to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language output system of &amp; k@@ de ; then click on the card@@ holder to open this map . here you can set some general options .
tick this check box to activate the K@@ DE TTS @-@ Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start succe@@ eds , the map card orders are displayed and you can create text orders and let them read . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is hal@@ ted and the TTS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is termin@@ ated , run &amp; kt@@ ops ; on , if the field is enabled voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr automatically appears in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the reading process finishes .
with buttons in this row you can launch , cancel , stop and record text orders .
with buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the card @-@ card orders are only shown when K@@ TT@@ SD has started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab card and tick over there voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first if &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs . then check the text that is to be read and select text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML , pre@@ stres@@ ses and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . check first if &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs . then check the text that is to be read and select text in the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works when &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; that noti@@ fies you about noti@@ fied events . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; conversation ; for example , set up a message when your nick@@ name appears in an IR@@ C channel . with &amp; kt@@ ops , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops , is a good example . it remo@@ ves the tags &apos; br and b from the news that sends K@@ Mail , and also the print@@ out / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as assumed .
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops , filters are not required .
filters are processed in filters before being sent to the &apos; speech &apos; label &apos; program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace unt@@ amed words or short@@ cuts , select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices .
to understand the working method of fil@@ tering it is important to know how the program &apos; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &apos; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts .
the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn from all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are res@@ um@@ ed .
al@@ erts have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and plain text . these orders are continued after the output of the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a web page , you can greet with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; kis@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you encounter orders from the map card is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just one such reads , this output will stop and termin@@ ate .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ viewers . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future there are still more types of filters .
dra@@ wers replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; is supplied with pre@@ defined strings ( such as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ formers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
with speaker selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program that sent the text to the text . for example , if you have set a female voice on the map card , you can read the text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue to pass the text to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; be sent , it is processed by all activated filters which were set up on the bottom . editing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the next setup di@@ alog@@ s will be displayed below .
you will need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison tool for setting of string inser@@ tion filters . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged against the corresponding substitute text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name at any time , it must be different from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column matching and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list will be processed in the shown sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries will be attached from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages mentioned here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key .
if a value is entered , the filter will only be applied if the text is from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only enter copy .
the string substitute filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string translation filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can use it in the di@@ alog@@ s , or edit them as help to assemble these expressions .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ former transl@@ ates &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is re@@ achable via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the speaker selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card holder , or to a speaker with specific features . you can , for example , specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ops ; a text is handed over to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker characteristics that the program sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; sends , and the characteristics of the speakers decorated on the card . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker .
if a value is entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; # 160 ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help from entering .
to get faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression using &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which meets the desired requirements . click on the button to the right to display the Spe@@ aker selection dialog .
use these buttons to store or load your speaking settings or to delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only apply to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter when applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programm@@ ers can give their applications TTS @-@ abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that you can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from program kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ Window . start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML , de@@ formation filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that SAB@@ LE does not work at all . you must also do that if you do not use this voice to read pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found through the PAT@@ H environment variable .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so whole sets are ski@@ pped or only che@@ wing is spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure the character enco@@ ding option is set to the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string translation filter .

KT@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . check also on the website of kt@@ ops ; , according to information contained in this manual .
the &apos; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &apos; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers . if you want to extend &amp; check for using another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used to support SS@@ ML and for the XML , but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the &apos; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &apos; program .
if you refer to the source texts of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from source archive for k@@ de@@ Fon@@ do or download the tar@@ ball , currently generated each night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ops , check first if speech dis@@ pat@@ cher works properly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the set @-@ up of speech discs is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can leave the pro@@ posi@@ tional or set @-@ up , repeat , stop or cancel the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender feminine , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be selected . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ops ; a speaker cho@@ oses , you will see in .
if you click on Ad@@ ding on the Map tab , and then insert a speaker into the list or click Edit , the Map tab will be displayed . as an example , the configuration of the module for festival Interactive will be shown below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival programme . if the path to festival is contained in PAT@@ H , you only have to enter festival .
select the character enco@@ ding for text that is handed over to the festival . in case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ops ; known , this setting will be made automatically . in general , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you can adjust the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controls and this gray will be displayed , the voice you choose doesn &apos;t show these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with larger memory usage ) the first set will be syn@@ thesi@@ zed more quickly .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forgot to click App@@ ly ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is displayed at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the straight edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card holder .
with the buttons in this series , you can proceed or return from the order placed in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other map cards ) are taken over and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also .
here only text records are listed and managed . editions of screen readers , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ops ; either compiled or stored without support for the appropriate audio module ; it cannot load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
adjust the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds roughly half and 200@@ bsp ; % about double normal speech speed . to enable these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you have to figure out which device works with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this map you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted from a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of language assign@@ ments :
the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn from all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are res@@ um@@ ed .
al@@ erts have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and plain text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks out messages . if you are &amp; eg ; just let a long text read on a web page , you can communicate with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ops ; the audio output to the queu@@ e .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introdu@@ ctory sound and introdu@@ ctory message are active , the introdu@@ ctory sound is played before the introdu@@ ctory message .
the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and screen outputs , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ops ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications . the card card will appear .
tick this check box to turn off &amp; collect ; notification feature . if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and stored ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played is written by &amp; kt@@ t ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sends whenever someone in an IR@@ C message men@@ tions your nick@@ name .
all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this field to specify what &amp; kt@@ ops ; do if an event occurs . you have the following options :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired subscri@@ ber . default sel@@ ects the speaker that is displayed as the top entry in the list on the Map tab . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , this action is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application .
the Event All Noti@@ fications for Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the button rel@@ o@@ ad to load saved settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speech speed , lou@@ dness , gender of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) since this is the default voice used in the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival Con@@ figuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and stat@@ ute limit filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sets . thus , you can also start using the first set of syn@@ thesi@@ zed orders , not the whole text order .
here you see the stat@@ ute limit filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops , a stat@@ ute limit filter will be automatically set up . you can change its settings or add additional set limit filters , but beginners will be advised .
the simpl@@ est way to learn how to set up the language selection by trying out . switch off the selection selection and select text to read . switch off the selection selection , change some features and check how the choice of the speaker changed . of course , you need to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
you can stop or cancel orders on the map card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal stat@@ ute limit filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just removed . change nothing at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limits recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ulator sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tabl@@ ature characters are automatically removed from the text before fil@@ tering ) . note that the default set limit filter keeps the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mess@@ ages ( k@@ notify ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders .
if you removed from view the normal stat@@ ute limit filter , you can insert it once again by downloading the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Map &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can over@@ ride the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aker Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the Standard Spe@@ aker ( the top on the card holder ) . in other words , no speaker characteristics are specified .
use of the most appropriate subscri@@ ber , who has all the features of a dedicated subscri@@ ber . if you do not delete or edit the subscri@@ ber &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ops ; the speaker , who is most likely to match the original features .
select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker . if this feature does not matter , do not enter anything .
highlight this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is ahead if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment .
to delete all the features in the range of speakers most likely to be deleted , click on the default speaker selection button and then use speaker that matches the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( no order number is the input 0 required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr immediately cr@@ ashes when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get trace tracking .
G@@ Stream@@ er has crashed and shut down . probably you need to record G@@ Stream@@ er . if the problem is not resolved by this , you may have a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stream@@ er installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stream@@ er .
audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application . if I get a text order , fre@@ eze &amp; kt@@ ops ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system there is the problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / f@@ estiv@@ al@@ int / vocals , add the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL where you have found the voice to the developers .
on the map audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program has to be installed so@@ x and search@@ able via the PAT@@ H environment variable . some syn@@ thesi@@ zer@@ modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the map of the speaker system . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . SS@@ ML has its own tags with which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite bold , change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML de@@ formation filter , and set up the speaking speed .
I don &apos;t make it happen that websites are read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads the websites with a male voice .
with Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SAB@@ LE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . thus , this festival does not produce errors , the x@@ sl file causes converting from SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own drawing utensi@@ l filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ops ; no longer set forth or go back . on the cart@@ on &apos;s orders it is shown , the order consists only from one set . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , excl@@ am@@ ation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter out . use a filter for character recognition instead .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; fre@@ eze if you stop a text order and then start another . you can find possible solutions for this problem on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you stop a text order in &amp; kt@@ ops , the current set will be read even more .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speaking speed , but otherwise not mandatory . Debian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included .
if you have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ops ; downloaded as a tar@@ ball ( with tar packaged archive ) , login as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ fre@@ er software .

before you use &amp; kt@@ ops , check first if your voice syn@@ thesizer is working properly . follow the instructions you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free TTS syn@@ thesizer whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported .
you must install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you have to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ril@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) enco@@ ding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . try the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the option code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the enco@@ ding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ril@@ lic such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete language output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . Festival creates this Di@@ phone .
with this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under

Free@@ TTS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ph@@ er voice syn@@ thesizer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can set neither pitch , volume , nor speaking speed .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ops ; with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line .
best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending output directly to the audio device
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user to perform the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displays network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and the setting of the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be charged by adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which best corresponds to the distribution and the rel@@ e balance . by marking the setting of non @-@ recur@@ ring questions , the fixing can be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings , then this selection will be automatically pres@@ et .
changing the network settings is only possible in system administration mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in system administration mode , you will be promp@@ ted by clicking the button System Management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to input the password .
in system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three categories :
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings displayed on the network can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... setup in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button &apos;s Advanced Settings displays the dialog with further possibilities .
with the selection Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are made for the system at the same time with the start of system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the drop @-@ down list you can select either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system .
with the selection Manu@@ ell , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the field of net@@ mask the sub@@ net mask is fixed .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface at boot . if initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on if required . switch off a switched network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched on as needed . switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
speci@@ fies the machine &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net that con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain address by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host is calling htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will resolve this name to an IP address , such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator part of the Rei@@ ters nam@@ ing solution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . entries can be sorted by selecting a single entry and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons down or down in priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group machine to the nam@@ ing solution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button ....
the list name known calcul@@ ator describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used in the boot when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list of particular well @-@ known hosts contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this will still be replaced in the test version of IP in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known calcul@@ ator and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , press the Add multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a particular known calcul@@ ator from the list and select Edit .... The dialog known machine will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings in the network settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ conf is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient to install &amp; che@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; install the rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical surface like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should make this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; variable configuration files are discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found big dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to en@@ force it in the near future .
one of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address of a network interface is to assign . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; Work@@ place is the network administrator to assign a valid IP address , or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore their use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route that branches the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own host ) .
the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this section are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically changed with DSL connections so it won &apos;t be surprised if there is another content in the case of active DSL connections as specified there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is random@@ ly sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

to activate or de@@ activate an environment variable , select it and specify the state with the menu item Edit activ@@ ates . if a de@@ activated variable appears under description De@@ activation .
alternatively , you can also use the right mouse button to click on the variable and select Activ@@ ate . make sure that the name and value of the variable will be displayed correctly .
if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you still need to save the cr@@ ont@@ ab file .

it appears the default k@@ de ; -@@ print dialog . if you choose out , you see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog .
print the cr@@ ont@@ ab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example Vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ ont@@ ab to change the time sched@@ ules of the user .
a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which moreover offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to fast , selective packaging . the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you secure ?
before a band can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; back the band back and read the band &apos;s pre @-@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information . det@@ ects &amp; dat ; don &apos;t recognize the band ; you &apos;ll be asked if the band is to be format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; dat ; the pre@@ fix , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched for the tape by opening the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the belt , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be disc@@ ar@@ ded without danger .
before a group of &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not con@@ form to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive needs to be format@@ ted before use , this will happen before you can be format@@ ted by the tape by &amp; k@@ dat ; Flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , DAT drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the band away . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens up settings for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu item D@@ UT ....
once the check@@ out is started , the dialog will display settings for checking . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for the check .
if you have confirmed the settings for the check , the dialog will be over@@ looked . this dialog shows the progress of the review process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ connect , the files that are to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the Rest@@ ore menu ....
once the recovery process has started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , dialogue will restore . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re@@ build the band index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ build the index to two types of the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder .
for all files listed under backup files , only the files currently in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder . folders that are on other file systems , you can separately add them to backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; and lt ; lt ; files have not yet been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding variant of the tape machine .
is this setting active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is bound , the command mt load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ ills ; to lock the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , when releasing a &amp; k@@ dat file , the tape will be ej@@ ected automatically . do not use this option in flo@@ ppy stream .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ y block size can be changed for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to communicate the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where the name of the system is the full name of the system on which the band has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has passed since the era in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this icon is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for System Log@@ s . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log , experienced users access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes among other things :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily fil@@ tered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , try to open the system log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - is not shown to you , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely not run with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log , for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also filter the fil@@ tering tool@@ bar to filter according to a selected crit@@ erion or after input string . the list of the log lines is now automatically changed , so that only log@@ files will be displayed . in the default setting , the drop @-@ down box contains the entry all . then , a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the selected column . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and then , in the filter bar , select the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a more con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous color as protocol @-@ lines of the level indicator . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off Setup dialog .
if you want to show only certain process ( for example , in the system protocol , or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identi@@ fier ( PID ) in the column process . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can switch to new lines in the main window context menu in order to display all new addition protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ de. d@@ ort you will find further information about the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
system V In@@ it is rapidly becoming a standard for the control of program startup at the startup of the system in the &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not go on to historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could attempt to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without installing a new installation and re@@ format . therefore , you must ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
Sys@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc , instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to start when running the system or switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things like network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
the r@@ c.@@ local should be on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something on startup , which has to do with the serial port .
the kernel looks in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that it finds .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . in the beginning , you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this then you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab from hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you have done something , then get it repaired by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and running the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from manually on the command line :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K contains , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run level running only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) .
note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new area . to just copy them to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the Sor@@ ti@@ ern@@ ummer of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the Sor@@ ti@@ ern@@ um@@ mers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : at present there is no way to re@@ produce entries thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the different work@@ spaces ( Verf√ºg@@ bare System@@ dienste , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board using cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it in the required run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to manually change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the Properties dialog . use the tab@@ ulator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they are restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine is constantly re@@ opening . what can I do ?
in the LI@@ LO prompt , type linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution at Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE , or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services in these distri@@ butions are started simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary setting programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to a standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) just quit without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; c@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; c@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; c@@ user ;
after making changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or save the entry in the File menu .
&amp; c@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties .
some card cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a map card will be created on which you can make individual settings . additional map cards appear , if shadow passwords , or for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the card @-@ card password management appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as installed in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if for at least a built @-@ in file system space constra@@ int ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the space restrictions are given in KB :
these parameters can be individually set for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the field file system with space constra@@ int .
the group map groups inform@@ s about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Group Dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click on the matching tool bar button . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group functions an@@ alogue .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO Boot@@ Manager , remove and change the boot password , remove and change the time until the boot of the standard operating system , remove , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
