<seg id="1">To translate the module website, go to the & konqueror; translate the menu under Extras Website. from the drop-down list, select the source and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated into place of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translation should not make important decisions, without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages can be translated. other texts should be translated into the Babelfish page, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains various modules for & conqueror; despite their small size they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual of & konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in the & Conqueror, select setting extensions... Open the map tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default setup modules from the kde; addons. please note that more modules may be on your system if you have installed additional software.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on & konqueror; click Extras Abst√ºrze. then you can view the page that has brought & Conqueror; or the list of crashes if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module pagefilter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras address filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed page. as presetting, the display begins with the root node of the document, example: an element, all other nodes are sub elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents a further view of objects with the MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views so as to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The specificity of & FSView; consists of graphically depicted filtering hierarchies using a so-called Tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in waxed structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must possess the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder defined as the sum of the size of the items in it. thus, large files, even then easily recognized, can be easily recognized when viewed far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore, you can view it as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the File Transfer display is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have useful inking and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle which is switched over view color mode can either be depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the illustration of any other file property like name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for the display or if the area is to be used by lower right angles (whereby, therefore, display error by restrictions on the mark of the use).</seg>
<seg id="19">In the case of display algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the item. in the case of the Tread in & FSView, this goal is not always respected. it is drawn frames to represent the dissemination of the entries. note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the surface of an entry for the subordinate entries is done, the implementation remains up to it. in this case, it is always advantageous for the label and to avoid space losses due to frameworks that are as quadratic as possible. the best methods of this are lines, columns or recursive distribution.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum permissible space for an entry via the menu item View Any on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the overarched entry, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; intended as a small test application and introduction to using the TreeMap Widgets designed to apply KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras\ 's gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the picture gallery, a dialog opens with which you can set the appearance of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The option title of the page allows you to customize the title of the gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option pictures per line has a slider and a field of rotation to set the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">To view the filename of the image, specify whether the file names are displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="28">Display the image size of the image to see if the file size is displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">Please specify whether the size of the images is displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog folder, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the file selection save in HTML file, specify where the HTML page should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "with the" "" "Cross-Folder" "" "dialog, you can set up to which level the subfolders are included." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original images to copy the original images to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">To use the comments file, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">Specify a different color depth for the thumbnail images as in the original images in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings provides easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & conqueror;</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in & konqueror; menu under extras HTML-Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">You can find the media playback for the navigation area in the & konqueror; view menu under Windows navigation field, or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigational area of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser recognition adds a menu entry in & konqueror; add to which you can change the browser and operating system identification for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser recognition of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that deny access to this browser, change browser recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Change the password in MSIE for sites that reject the access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browsers to call with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes, are correctly represented with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry Configuration... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & Conqueror; module check your & CSS; -style sheets and & HTML; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">You can check the module website in the & konqueror; check menu under Extras Website. you can make the following exams:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; check out if your & HTML; document of the syntax of & HTML; matches all found errors will be displayed. with this test you can ensure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to check your & CSS; styles included in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; document. with valid and CSS; your web pages have a consistent look regardless of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Check the links on your page on forwarding and faulty links. recursively all links are checked on the website.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you specify the addresses of the servers for checking your & HTML; -documents and & CSS; style templates.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module Web-Archiver for & konqueror, you can save web pages with text and images in .war format.</seg>
<seg id="53">Click the mouse on the Tools website to archive and a dialog appears to save the displayed page.</seg>
<seg id="54">The module Web-Archivierer is Copyright & copy; 2001-2003 Andreas Schlapbach, Antonio Larossa and Malte Starostik schlpbch @ iam.unibe.ch larossa @ kde.org malte @ kde.org</seg>
<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the photo2 library. of course, every medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digipack; contains a fast image processing with base image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the processing capabilities can be easily expanded using KDE Image Plugins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, there are dozens of professional capabilities available. it works fully in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG Export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; over the camera or lens to be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also called & digious; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digipack; tries to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu includes an entry problems or requests.... This will open a dialog with an underlined link. if you are using these links, your web browser will open a page in error reporting system. all required information is listed here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project that is supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digious; then we would like to answer you questions to other users of & digikam; but in this mailing list, English is spoken, you should be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digipack; homepage to see news about shared versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to join & digikam; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for signing in the developer mailing list from & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you click & digipack; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you must specify a local folder on your computer. here the data abnk is stored. this path will remain the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digipack; will also be used as an AlbenLibrary. preferences digiKam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images, as a basic folder. & digipack; looks at any subfolder as an album. no image will be changed. while searching the folder you will see a progress indication like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; durdicates recursively the library path in all its depth. you can't exclude sub-folders unless it is in hidden folder. this allows you to insert extra subfolders and digitised by adding a point in front of the subfolder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon. for more details, see the Albums section.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the basic folder, you can set up & digitized; set up your digital camera. afterwards, you should learn how to use my albums and my keyword boxes to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw data support: if you use the raw-mode of your camera, & digious; possibly also deal with it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to setup this and work with raw files is described in sections of raw decoder settings and raw workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the photo2 library. of course, every medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash, Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera is then used as a disk drive. the camera can also be realized via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digious; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital camera. Photo2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras, which has developed an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. it also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images of digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digipack; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the thumbnails of digitization can be read reliably. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, thumbnail images may not be seen or the creation might be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digikam; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, PhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules with all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digious; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in & digikam; do yourself.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove page strips with & LMB; remove or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 resp. Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and laying images works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the Albenbauma, via the horizontal dividing line or another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be deposited in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selector allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view at the moment. so the filtering on the filename works only if this ind it symbol view is displayed. which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the settings settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album room. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were recorded on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the AlbenProperties or after the date the album was created first. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan an album Import images. you can also add a screenshot to an album. select Album Import Screen Shot.</seg>
<seg id="87">In order to copy or move an image from an album to another, you can move the photo to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, you need to click on the album with the right mouse button and select Edit properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- Collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos, if you choose to sort the collection from the toolbar or view the albums sorted by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do it in the Settings for Collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums, sort by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons elder, average, nests: these put the date on that of the oldest, the newest image or the average of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & digikam, the first image is selected in the album as a symbol for the & quot; My Albensis quot; this will help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; as an album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in one collection and collections cannot be waxed.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digious; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the My keyword list left bottom in the main window. album collections always have a different effect. the collection includes all the photos of the album. of course, you can use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures will be shown in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can customize the size of this preview using the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait a little while the thumbnails are generated. this allows you to avoid using the preview images in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be displayed below the related preview. what information this is, you can talk about settings digipated; set up. click here the albums page and adjust the range of thumbnails to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help window which appear. if you leave the mouse-cursor a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all that matters at & digikam; goes. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. the image processing shows your photos and allows you to perform a number of improvements to this. you can use all the functions that are with & digious; you can choose between viewing the pictures, a slide show or the editing of the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by clicking on either F4 image Edit... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit.... in the digipack section, you will find a guide how to edit your photos. with the image editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of Open. to this, and how to customize it to your needs if your program is not enumerated, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing with other image editing programs, there can be problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digipack; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way to click on the preview and select rotation. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 renaming from the context menu. note that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digikam, it is moved in the dustbin of & kde; moved. F8 image deletion or Del if you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumslipquot; organizes your photos on the basis of the data. & digikam; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet in the date view, so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way of organising and cataloguing your photos. Tags are stickers that can be assigned individual photos or entire groups. as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My stub wordlistquot; so you can easily find the keywords you're looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs. in addition, the keywords are re-imported in the loss of the database as soon as & digicame; the pictures are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking on & quot; My keyword; or click on an existing keyword and then select new keyword. if you want to add a new keyword after you clicked on an existing keyword, this is the substitchword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo will not be deleted itself. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and place it down. then a menu appears that gives you the chance to move the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword quot; change.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right button of the mouse and select it in the context menu as an album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">Um & digikam; s functionality with keywords to handle, first you need to provide your photos with keywords. this can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want with a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword quot; alternatively, you can also use the right mouse button to select the thumbnails and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can provide a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was done etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword, in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the symbol menu. the menu only displays the keywords that have been assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The time beam view displays a time-dependent hiring of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, you only need to click on the bottom rectangle of the frame, which displays the time unit. thus, all associated images are displayed in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the box below you can enter a title and save your selection. this will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamp and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">The search box is a small lamp that gets green when the search is found. if you click on it, the filtering is deleted and all pictures are displayed again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the rider on the left side bar with the binoculars. if you open this, you can save a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search will be performed. the results are displayed in the My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection once again, you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit search, the search form will appear again with the search information entered before. if you choose to edit as extended search, the dialog will appear for advanced search to change your previous search. here, more rules are available for searching. more information can be found in the section The tool for Advanced search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatenbank. all rules are displayed by operators separated, enumerated. one option can be added to this list by search group / search group. any option can be associated with others about the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least... you can create searches of the type & quot; AND NIGHT.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digious; each image is characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the lower the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond to each other. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar one. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the inexact search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can let it fall there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand-color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digipack; find the matching pictures. here, too, a swelling value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can use the mouse wheel or zoom in or hold it. move it while you push the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to drag a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes, of course, your pictures contain Geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the bottom field below you can specify a name for your Geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geodirectory.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a luminaire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem Light table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the luminaire and its window is opened. if you are back in & digial; main window, you can quickly open the luminaire with L Extras Sportable.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview toolbar, you can drag the images you want to compare, to the left or right corner of the window and place it. a small arrow will show you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select preview of the toolbar and perform the Zoo or shooting operations on one of the images, then you can compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series. if you use pairs from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparisons. use the left mouse button at any thumbnail to display it on the left. this makes it easy to work through a number of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course normal deletion actions also work directly from the luminaire, e.g. F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnail images. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom end of each section you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to rotate the visible area of the image, you need to click them and hold the & LMB. in the Preview Mode, both pictures will display the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom functions just like in other views. just use the Zoom slider under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images if you are previewing in the mode preview.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - apart from the buzzword? digital inventory management considers every part of the process, after the image has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage. each of the photos takes, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. however, most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images, find, protect, and use photos again. we will focus on the procedures for digital photographers the & digipack; use. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, converting, reviewing, archiving, optimizing, archiving, archiving, storing and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital stock management takes up, indexed, categorized, assures, searches, transformed, confectionate and exports content that have a monetary or cultural value .quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is based on your definition data, which provide information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I venture to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need no inventory management to find a certain photo. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digikam;. the approach to store the metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and a secure archiving to you with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and know before you incorporate any information into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you do enough photos then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements like versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files match together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or an derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend saving the metadata option in the metadata settings page. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data can be written to the file. if you forget this then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the respective item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what if you want to change which ones? it provides and digipated; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. of course, these are the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now assign keywords, inscription and valuation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value then. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos at the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's start with keywords, keywords, as you often call in other programs or continue categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically build the tree for you, resetting the images to the right place. the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by dragging one substrate to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very rough representation as each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool for cataloguing your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to just let anyone share your photos, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming of having associations, memories, the historical period of time is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a label for itself to work alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE can even export it to your wishes into the lettering and / or the title of the web-gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now runs with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit the geolocation are already incalculable and will be deepened in the future. I am sure that someday, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels through images with geographic data. & digious; you can also export the photos at the reception site. you can also export the images to Gallery2, picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the furnishing page of & digikam; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the photographer's name, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author Title (synonym for author line): associated with the author. this field contains the photographer's work name. examples of this can be titles such as: employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify who the photo offers. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not offer protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or modify them in the picture. for individuals, this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digious; will be available in the near future such a module for stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: Plattenfehler, Plattenausfall, Stromst√∂√üe, ECC, Transfer errors, ageing of the storage media, restoration, redundancy, desaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these kind of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem of CDs / DVDs, these must be dealt with cautious and you can no longer believe them than a couple of years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that will claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you are using good discs and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD Capture Devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to mistakes, even if you have just been written. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called IsoBuster, which seems to do wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks appear to capture the format war against HD DVD. a Dual-layer Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said on CDs and DVDs is of course also available for the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn with a good recording device on top quality media in a non-propriate format. likewise, read the media with a description, date & author and then store the data on a clean, dark dry and protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discerning manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. your manufacturer's antioxidants comprise a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="187">In short: discos are kept at the longest when operating in temperature range from 35 ¬∞ C to 45 ¬∞ C. The error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error, SMART can't determine these faults. some of SMART's errors indicate the imminent failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also recover data loss due to a current failure before you have saved the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices don't matter much, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high speed processes. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause heavy damage, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy slots and bids the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. but remember that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it offers protection against lightning strike and therefore protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripherals connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage dividers that also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds may result in the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a break-free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically make battery power available when a power failure occurs. some models allow you to store your data and run the system. if you purchase a USV then you should be sure they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifespan of the battery and the included software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in power disruptions with the cost to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. finally, you should always remember all the cables before you travel to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can include it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are expensive compared to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. their free storage is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. for $25 per year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality only.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are cleaned automatically thanks to the TCP protocol, and with the large companies it is included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calculator. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one says to you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have no protection for it in your computer. no one seems to have ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interruptions within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly concerned about transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">It is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard with a GPL compatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is available soon also for & Linux; and Windows. read this article in english.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrf file system. this is still in the Alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by the ZFS and is also available for & Linux; but it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% in the workplace systems.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to less damage, such as theft or re-installation. and it is currently confined to Microsoft systems; Apple users know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source filesystems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS, and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden disruption during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical borders. it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural boundary for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel cameras. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result rather deteriorates. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard disk today for 100 & euro; so do not blame anybody else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are often affected by a data loss each year. so, secure your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as reinstalling your operating system, replacing plates or resizing disk drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash will hit you luck when the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">Disaster strikes local and destroys a lot. forget aircrafts: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Despaving Prevention always means a non-local storage. bring up your fuses up the stairs, into the neighbor house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another benefit of physical separation: as stated above is a common reason for data loss in spite of securing the panic. if you have a backup, which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last full backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: to the full backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: backup of the files that have been modified since the last backup. you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made. this backup comes closest to a versioning system, with the exception that is only tarnished and is not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference between files that have been changed. this happens when you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after saving them on your computer to a DVD or a different visual media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach gives you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. each additional thinning should be done manually, after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in image file, IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retained, memory, scalability, media, recurring images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization,..., Use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So precious images survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you must consider all that is being said today with caution and re-evaluate during the time. unfortunately, there is no other way than a certain vigilance forwards. all 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system has been used backwards. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: each time you change your computer architecture, your memory and security technology, or your file format, you should review your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability, and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux, you can copy this area and store it onto a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg, whether your new plate has been detected by the system, but don't hang it in.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollars; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of disk in MBgt; # functions with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollars; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of the drive if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. you should therefore no longer use it.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard, but it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can use gamma and chromaticity data for improved color allocation for heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (DEFLATE). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a royalty-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is developed on the TIFF / EP format and indebted to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope the competitors Canon and Nikon will also use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a blend of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, to archive. XMP adapts to it because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, the raw format will decay. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as containers and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compliant online metadata standards that support a wide range of application and business models. the activities of DCMI include work in the DCMI communities and DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the cameraman, you can use it as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layered editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images back with & digitipped, then you should add the metadata again. under certain circumstances, these were cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. first export them to webgaleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the addition of a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import pictures to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digious; to use, connect them to the computer, turn the camera into the display mode and turn it on. you will find another description in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it attempts to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a remote indicator appears at the bottom and thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display preview images. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file association settings for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before downloading the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can view the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras don't have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata tab displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata toolbar from the main window of & digikam; or the image editing. note that these metadata is not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of All. this loads all photos from their camera into a single album in & digikam;. when downloading, the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the option you want with the default selection methods of & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the download button to download the selected selection button. download the Selected button until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these images have not been downloaded by & digijoined until now. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you use the buttons All download or download selections, a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are discarded. the list of existing albums will be displayed in the My albums section. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digikam; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by using the Delete Delete button. if you want to delete only a few, then you have to select them first and then delete the selected selection.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to restore photos that you deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check whether the photos were successfully deleted from the camera; so you should carefully check whether the photos are successfully deleted from the camera. if you want to delete the camera filter completely, you should do this by camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are often used as filenames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are usually re-used after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can result in double filenames, if you upload photos of different recording series into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for date-based subanoints. if you use this option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during transmission are opening three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two affect the data via the author in the Standard AutoretIdentity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the default format, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. turn off the date & time option. for further modifications, you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading. or in uppercase if you prefer it.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digious; uses for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings to rename are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digious; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during the download. not all cameras provide this information. in the page bar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera does not provide this information, the photo is in its original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic rotation, use the Advanced tab and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, & digious; this is used to automatically create underscores in the target album. all pictures with the same date are provided in the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar meta data, you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case stores & digipkam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn this option on. use the Advanced tab and select the date-based subanoints at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer is the download button. then select uploading. the file selection dialog & kde; appears in which you can select the files that are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, queries & digikam; you, where the images are to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog appears for the camera. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in length and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. determination of data can be carried out by the American GPS, Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to account for an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environment planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser with a click that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another and digipack; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to pack the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exi2 supports many GPS data fields such as the direction, semitones and map references. the question is actually more how the data comes into these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographic allocation (manual) and lastly by manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transferring the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS-Interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save these data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the module to the geographic allocation.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data from images and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux;: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool from Phil Harvey. it uses the presidents hairy coordinates created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation data for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digious; tries to give you so much control over his work processes as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digiame. to access these settings, you need to choose settings digiously in the Settings menu. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on stained previewing or editing image editing. you specify the default behavior of & digious; specify when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standard identity and copyright data. these data are automatically written in the appropriate IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author Title is a synonym for author line: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. these can be designations such as photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this does not have to be the author, if it works for a news agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC field. this will ensure that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digious; these metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in & digities.Imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save images of images as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos with the inscription embedded in the pictures. this allows your recordings to be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor rests in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digipack; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digipack, try, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminaire from & digikam; can be set on this page to the default values. each time you open the luminaire, these settings can be switched on. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one, then you can get better visual results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can disable the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image. these colors are specified here. in the image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma subsampling is meant to encodes the images in a higher resolution of the luminance density than in the color deformations. please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting of PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality as PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files compressed, you can turn the DEFLATE compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it does not affect image quality as the DEFLATE algorithm works loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">By setting lossless JPEG 2000 files you can save loss-free. even if you select the lossless setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, image editing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is very fast becoming a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if the straight-line green pixels react to sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a minimal loss of details. this option distinguishes the picture a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 mesh pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed color balance, which is based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed pictures in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the more pointed, so the parts of your images are burned in, because of the inability of your camera to catch the nickname, as piercing white. use the setting color triggering some unusual results as it displays the peak lights in various rosaries. lastly, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digious; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstruction option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it higher than the default 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digious; image editing. to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the image data that come from the filtered image sensor that has many cameras and provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or color design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digious; and Dcraw provides three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like that. as if AHD interpolation (for Adaptive homogeneity-Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for color correction, since you are done during the unconversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and gives instructions how to return it. there are also LCMS and & digiplugs; information about how to translate the color information from a colour space to the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image editing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folders Senter the folder, such as / usr / share / color / icc, or / home / user / .color / icc in which you save all your profiles. & digious; check this folder then during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC-Profile You have the option & quot; default squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your images are color-administered not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should correspond to the camera manufacturer and model that you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain color-tone mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma is not corrected for conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile that you can emulate on how to emulate your image from a device. this is very useful before you print image, since your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated. this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious what color profile is provided for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. so here a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension lets you see the style for the finish: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by providing this interface, & digious; many modules support that were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these will then be loaded from & digipack; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the Settings menu in the Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information about KIPI modules can be accessed via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the frame outputs, normally 4-5 seconds are good. the other buttons switch on or off the metadata that are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">Camera properties are shown on the left hand side of a list of all supported cameras. on the right side there is a knob auto detection, trying to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use it, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode. among these are the port settings. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage ameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire storage camera from the camera list. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use & digitised your digital camera, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it into the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digikam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images to the M√ºlleimer, you can preview & digipack the conversation; when you delete a photo in an album, you can find more details when deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly used by & digijoined; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any questions. otherwise, you need to save changes to the button modifications.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also include the indication of the welcome screen of & digikam; in the starting process, this will speed up the start-up of & digious;.</seg>
<seg id="334">Setting the Start after new photos forces & digicame; searching the basic folder for new or deleted photos / photos. this extends the start time of & digipack;. if something was deleted from the root folder, queries & digikam; you, if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & digikam; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digipack; includes a fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and to correction and improvement. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button to preview a picture or through the context menu of the preview and selecting the item Ads / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digipack; so they may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, please refer to the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current filename, magnification coefficient and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing features of image editing will change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using the Save or Save button from the toolbar. note that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with file save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you haven't saved the photo, you can restore the original image by restoring from the File menu or use the button Restore the image editing Restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually every action of the image editing can be undone or reproduced. the last action you can undo by selecting Edit Reset or Restore by selecting Edit Recover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should remember the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z for recourse and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the undo / restore button in the toolbar for a moment, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will also be undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a photo to the window size, you can use this button on the toolbar: automatically select the magnification factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View fullscreen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc button. normally the toolbar will appear. if you do not wish to do so, you can change it in the Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print single images or entire sets. entire image preloads can be printed out of your selection. you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Exports printwizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digious; main window has a sidebar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigation path, even in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear into the border again.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the panel view, you can enter or insert certificates with unlimited size. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the inscription is copied to the EXIF- and IPTC fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments will be cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next picture, the inscription will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section displays a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and gradation. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortel Strg + 0... 5.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field urgency. the encoding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view displays a search box for the filtering of the keywords, the keyword tree and a box with the keywords before.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given keyword. you can restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when typing keywords in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate crossroads in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If you select several images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection, if you want to provide a sample with a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar stub keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, - datum-, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filter is used from the right-hand side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and place keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view, to give you keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears, which asks you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images in a calendar day. the keyword filter stands on no keywords, which reduces the quantity to three images. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and filed there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off on Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be a or be, you can easily change it by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry to which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can, for example, specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the grouping button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were picasaweb and Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digicame; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-administered workflow is that the colors that have been photographed by your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-administered workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanner and that correspond to the colors you print or publish on the web from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you can get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other pictures are by email or web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and have to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colours we can see, the hufeisenshaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente page and click on Info and then on information about RGB working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callify my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working in a sRGB colour space or not, you have to callify your monitor because sRGB is designed to callify your monitor. if you work as a sRGB colour space, you must either callify your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before you attempt any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, merge, automatic deviation and contrast expand from the menu Corrigate Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scans the darkest point black and the brightest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Matching: this method adjusts the luminous factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes, the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation, which causes miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic compensation: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it calculates the dark and bright margins and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Extending Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values in the widest possible range and a new jiuson of all values in between. this is only visible with exposed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digious; is a semi-automatic tool to carry the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited because of a colour space with 8-bit per colour. if you are too far from the original picture, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better off.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adjusted to the tool settings. if you want to see the original white balance again, you can click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">A histogram shows that dynamically is changed once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether any of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. the shade of adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in the white balance. this will appear in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and Upload are doing exactly this. every adjustment of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load later again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button returns all filter values to its default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this encoding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-tone mapping can be performed through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time, so that you can use it for multiple photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner will always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction. in the manual for the sound correction, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digious; tool colour effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar system effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, an effect created when a partially developed pressure emitted a short flash light and then inverted the development of the picture. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors inverted through the second illumination. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. with approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another increase finally creates a negative image, so that it is not produced on photopaper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated color with daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlight. in large images, the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photo. you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too great saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce the saturation rather than raising it. all changes you can perform can be viewed in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is used for improving exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slider for the purposes described here.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph, three sliders are clicked in and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to postpone the controller and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and thumbnail preview can be viewed. the preview is updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left side the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, linear representation is often dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulators: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the bottom for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinpettes can be previewed in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadow, medium and light tones. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulators that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. the compression of the output values can, for example, be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the filesystem and later recharged. in addition, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colour pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, media and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of adjusting the input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side is displayed half of the original and the target image. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifiziere channel: this box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two icons to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images that were taken with a digital camera, linear mode usually generates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output tones and that the associated pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marking to see. if you want to shift this marker on the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons, you can do exactly that. each curve you created can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, mid- and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you will get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the Luminance Channel. shadow and sun shades were placed with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digious; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel blender of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image a vertical line in the histogram appears to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you enable Luminance, the image will keep the overall brightness as the channel mixer then is DAS tool for generating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from farrowing. farrowing is made up of small rough artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose pattern is different in each channel. if that's the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you reduce the color need first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used for this purpose. any Mixer setting can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re-adjusted. the option Luminancy Store is enabled. the original image is shown below (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / White has always been fascinating because of its abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step as color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lentil filter. this looks good at all scene images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate moon light scenes at daytime. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tonic correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold in the shades of shame. this is very similar to the process of failure of a pressure and the redevelopment in a sepia schooner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Use the & digipack; apply tool texture to apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, no matter if it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper texture effect was applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2). the parameter Relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam; adding tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. to add frame frame the module can be started from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. the image with a colored line, niepce transfers it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame, ideal for a button effect and decorative inserts an ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specify the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any place. this also works in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from color space and character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you click OK. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the & digipack; to apply tool template you can place a template using a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The picture menu template uses in image editing can be used to put templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of template. if you want to add your stencil template to your templates, just send an email in English to the & digikam; mailingliste digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil template with the root folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings will be marked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the templates was set, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the templates folder. selecting a folder updates the templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button reduces the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digipack; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but it creates, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">The sharpness mask works on the contrast of edges to let a picture look sharper. actually, it's not a bit tougher. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is probably the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. this is due to the digitization process colours with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn leads to sharp edges a bit blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more retrofitting than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">Image in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a sharpness filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpness of the sharpness. you can call up sharpening with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should deal with this, however, as the results do not seem very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of edges, but also strengthens the noise. in general, the most useful technique is to refocus the tool. you can easily refocus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool to softwise soft signs and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurly masking is a very good tool for removing veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help you edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase of the radius or the amount amplifies the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will produce near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. they should therefore sharply sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference-amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference for a edge of the filter. in this way areas with a soft change between the sounds are excluded from sharpening and hence beauty flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example for the unsharp masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfaltungs-Filter -algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to refocus a picture & quot; refocus quot; in which it reversing the picture. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding operates much better than the Gauge's fold. the Gau√ü 'split has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the spring pixel, which is far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gau√ü' split is actually very strongly influenced by the remote pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular acuity: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filters: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0, the image quality will be very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gau√ü 'sharpness: this is the radius for the palate's sharpness. use this parameter if your blurred gauss is' sch. this is most commonly caused by a previously executed blur filter. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value non-zero, you may also need to increase correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the matrix. an increase in die size can generate good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpening or the Gauge's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow when selecting large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocus parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible, which will later leave unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by unsharp masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masking must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has to be corrected with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the field of sharpness correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator Gl√§tte sets the blurring of the area darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink tinplate allows a customized paint for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CIM project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the Gl√§ttung and Advanced Settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="519">Details posture p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the picture. if greater values are mainly homogeneous regions flatten and details. a value of 0.9 should provide details so that no acuity is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes uniformly in all directions while a value close to 1 is only smoothed in one direction. if you have a film granularity or CCD Rauschen, a high value creates wavy patterns. JPEG artifacts are best fixed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor over ally. p then defines the relative smoothness. therefore set this value matching the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' tower effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally, there is 1 or 2 here.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-Width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is chosen small, there should also be small chosen. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as greatest as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral increments [0,1, 10]: integral increments in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation: the more quality you get by choosing this option is only low. however, it doubles the term. we therefore recommend it to let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and Upload are doing exactly this. correcting any image errors can be saved in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors can be corrected relatively quickly at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the abort button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with small artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you see, there is a unique black artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad film shift during the journey. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digious; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other artifacts such as dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor screws from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">Below you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the advanced settings window can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller errors are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front to determine light density changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer get the image details and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can not remove all the noise or noise peaks can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammattolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, typically smothered more strongly.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter damping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, edges and phase jitter may appear at edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected (2) corrected. the noise reduction was used with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool to softwise soft signs and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digious; Photo Restauration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photographic artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gau√ü's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture composition. the texture replacement is performed using a different tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CIM project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it creates some compression & quot; artefactsquot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and loading do exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very quickly at work. however, it can take a very long time and draw a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise levels. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 movie has been recorded on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious filing on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected at (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts that were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows hotpixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera close to eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw-mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression of hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixelquot; and "quot; bright pixelquot; in a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the Dunkelimage button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you pick up the dark image directly to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD failures.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it again in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview can help you correct the result inside the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all thumbnail areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and see the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">During: an average of neighbour pixels is measured. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2 dim) or a group of linear curves (1 dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2 dim) or a group of square curves (1 dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2 dim) or a group of cubic curves (1 dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture can be seen below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digious; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shady) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also be used with Center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise immitive effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure of today's film and color or grey scales of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was taken without this filter. the tool Vignettierungscorrection applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators, you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the level of light intensity at the point of the greatest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, which provides an optical filter with a lens setting of 1, or randomly to compensate a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction decreases the luminous intensity of pixels. you need to re-adjust the exposure of the target image with these options.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more subtle re-adjustment of the target image, leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digipack; image editing from the color gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">The original picture (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a magnification and contrast correction was also carried out with the image using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digious; lenticular distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth grades corrects the distant corners to that of the second grade. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the strength of distortion of the second grade. with negative values tonnenical distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion of the fourth grade. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scans the image size and thus results in correcting the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image is smaller.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value Adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values that you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonn- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. best guide this correction as the first. if you cut a picture new and then perform a tonnenical correction the effect would obviously be the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line. move it to an important place, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards you can correct the tonn- / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black edges. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu Transformate crop from the image processing or via the Zoom slider of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs, e.g. shots from the front, frame and paintings, is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of tonnenical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film from the Gimpber u.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the Preview you can set two parameters set filming and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Add film granulation when you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO control changes the amount of film granulation and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in converting. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filter color channels are mixed to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filmetic applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digious; filter film granulation is an easy-to-use tool for reproducing film granulation on your pictures. this is known by classical high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix great silver grains of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The projection effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, road photographic, grainy appearance specially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The regulator can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although higher values are required, to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the filmed effect effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and this worked the (2). the used film sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digious; Filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digious; oil painting filter gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. flattens controls the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the stiffness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the editing is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digious; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. images of their gradients are slowly changing and therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you. this would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digious; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digious; Filter Gravur is a fast tool to give your pictures back with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monarch landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, equal to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: divides the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave-blocks 2: similar to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of immitive effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Inspection: blurks the image along star-shaped lines from a center point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels to the center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: wipes the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: wipes the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: taking pictures from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening sharpness: wipes the image softly into the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour images or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shooter sharpness: wipes the image through random displacement of pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an involuntary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the color in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the picture into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives it natural to your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. as the drop-size does not automatically increase with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish augen changes the visual effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can choose with the & digipack; editing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regentropfen filtering. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) points a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can put it in the right direction through mirrors or turning. the tools can be found in the menu Transformieren Drehen or Transformers mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles are definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of picture quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharply? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CIF algorithm used here makes here a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformieren size change in the menu and enter the target values.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool for blowing.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CIM project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keep aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the original image aspect ratio will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' tower effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and Upload are used for exactly this purpose. enlarge each photo magnification for photo can be saved as a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it makes, but it can still take a very long time and draw a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a often underestimated operation, but also a frequently underrated tool to create an image. to crop a photo you need to create a picture with the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle as you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the clipping area by dragging on the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button of the cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries to save or save file under the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by dragging the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Folding aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait format or landscape format. in the portrait format, the greater value of the height and the cross-format is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool Folding to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can, for example, see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio button to set the area to crop on the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool Folding aspect ratio stores its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings will be stored as default values depending on orientation. the changed image measurements are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflects the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the cohesion help allow you to blend in, so that you can put your pictures together better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of resemblance. like the third-elbow, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in a similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division divided into different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the flower leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; and the dividing divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid aid lines if you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. in comparison to the third rule, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition conducts the view of the beholder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangle. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. its vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangle. note that unlike the harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonal on these lines can be placed a static object dynamically.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your picture focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">Flip options horizontally and mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo then it easily happens that you don't hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the & digious; image processing and tool free rotation. select transformieren free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider back to 0 degree. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right top.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have turned a picture, you will find undesirable triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is to use the function transformieren crop cut out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically slice function. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. however, keep in mind the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically re-calculated. on the right-hand side of the dialog, you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left edge of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right up: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture becomes slightly dirty. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unhappy triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformer cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The encoding tool is used to postpone part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a right angle is transformed into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scroll your image by using horizontal and vertical angles. you can put horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will show you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be shown to the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">Move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the shear, the picture will wipe a bit. for a single shear this effect is usually negligible, but two notes producing twice as much wipes and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shear, the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transformer cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digious; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, compiled by the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, they will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; shows only files in formats that you know. this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digikam; the file is displayed in image editing.</seg>

<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way in this way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG in the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save loss-free if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, see Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful tutorials in English. you can convert rough format images in JPEG or TIFF to the raw image converter of & digikam; in section configuration you will find further information on how to use modules with & digikam;.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need the photo editing are included in & digipack; your description follows here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, molluscs, noise suppression, refocus, blurred masking, & etc;. use a uniform dialogue type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image. on the left of it, five buttons allow to change the comparative mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertically divide without duplicates. the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the field on the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontal dividing without duplicates. the upper area shows the original and the lower part shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="706">Horizontally. the upper area shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="707">'mouse over 'style: shows the Preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original.</seg>

<seg id="709">(3): the frame to choose the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place on the part of the image you want to preview. the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module will be marked.</seg>
<seg id="711">The page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo Characteristics: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos. these data originate from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can use the mouse wheel or zoom in or hold it. move it while you push the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to drag a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes, of course, your pictures contain Geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for pallet files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The Paletten files that are installed by & kde can be applied either for the whole system or just one user. in the latter case, they are in your Personal folder for & kde; -settings and hot user-defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the dialog pallet, you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folders for files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">It indicates the color next to it. the color is described under the pallet view. here, the color name can also be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used to select. to create such a selection, click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it. afterwards, move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box Beim Cursor is activated below the button color, the color is inserted from the color chart at the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwrites another; depending on whether the mode overwrite was selected. this mode allows you to select by selecting the crossing field below Beim Cursor.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that was created in such a way as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying, cutting and pasting.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in the clipboard: for each color, three values for the portions of red, green and blue and an optional dye, followed by a line ending character, if another color follows. if three figures are in the clipboard, they can be inserted as a color in & kcoloredit.</seg>
<seg id="723">The colors in the palette and the color selection output can be dragged with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="724">Select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selector on the left side.</seg>
<seg id="725">& kdemoviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, in particular in computer science. so far, there has been no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kdemoviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kdemoviewer; is an KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graphs. the & graphviz; -programs are free layout programs. & kdemoviewer; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; -program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & kate; the graph is re-calculated and in & kdemographics; shows)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & kate; Open or open the graphs in & kdemoviewer; in one of the works;</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting about 1000 knots and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kdemoviewer; is a & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; required for displaying the graph.</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window shows the opened graph, each in its own subwindow. initially, when you start & kdemoviewer; without an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list contains opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog File.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right at pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by the factor of 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been changed by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change. & kdemoviewer; can also remember your decision, so that later will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can change the menu item Settings tograph viewer; see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you want to open a graphite file outside a running & drag-instance, & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraph viewer, or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but you can change it afterwards with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph coming to one page should be fitted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph displayed on several pages without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The renew shop page gives you the possibility to specify the behavior when a file is changed on hard disk, eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore the changes) or leave the program any time.</seg>
<seg id="746">Opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kdemoviewer; if a graph is opened outside of a running session, you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or specify that every time it is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The Site Management page gives you the possibility to specify the startup behavior of & kdemoviewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not) the files of the last session (or not) or determine to be asked at any start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which normally appears at a click in the main window with the RMBn, opens further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries as described on the web page of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; -algorithm, the standard for directed graph. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of directional graphs. the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge-edges as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; -algorithm is the default for ungerized graphs. it produces representations according to the springspring model. thereby, the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; -algorithm produces a springspring model layout for ungerized graphs. it uses the Fruchterman-Reingold-Heuristik, and includes a multi-sensor for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & circo; algorithm ranks the vertices circular in accordance with the description of Six and tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclical structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which is then executed by a shell. the command should accept the graphendatei as parameters, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in the xdot format. with such a layout command, you can specify & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms, or even modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graphs (directed or ungerized) and applies the standard algorithm for each type (dot; for directed, & neato; for ungerized graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Displays the What is the mouse pointer. click on a & GUI element with this mouse pointer to get further help to this element (if available).</seg>

<seg id="772">To read the KIPI module images provides tools to read and store new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan Pictures: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. for this, you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry pictures, a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to get the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default ducumhe's default values to select your image. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you click the button scan the image. the estimated file size is displayed in the right lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is completely displayed, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the button scanning, you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window appears to specify the options of the target image. please remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore very large files created. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screen shots once you have selected the Import &gt; screen shot in the menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photos:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all own program window is selected, the calling program will disappear so you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, read the currently visible workstation. if you chose to read the complete desktop, only the window is read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shots are waiting before it starts. if you need to switch on other desktop space, you should choose this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made, the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it's possible to show his photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, put photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and private to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module Exports to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you are guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. thus, it is virtually your identification to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can login to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successfully registering, the module can send photos to Flickr web page. the following page will be presented to you after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have clicked Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the module exports to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which shows the current access permissions that the module displays. for uploading, you need authorisations. the module currently supports no other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be clicked once you have all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press the Ok button, upload the photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the Public, Friends and Famillie options, you can set the permissions on your images. by default, the photos are classified as a private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose the option Modify the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed before uploading in the size. the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module gallery export has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. the geographic data is stored in the EXIF keywords in the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data, you need a GPS track as XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsone can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical Localization Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go up the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. in order to run a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were recorded at the same places at the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is carried out which shows coordinates in red. GPS tracking data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done using the time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper variance for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is included, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The Interpoling and Difference options can be used if you don't have the right data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and push the correlated button to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place. as the dialog itself coordinates the coordinates from one call to the next, you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and placed with the indicated map. select the region and increase sie.Driving this repeatedly until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely out of the KIPI module, there are ways to attach GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a pile of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option For each image create a page creates a gallery where the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed.</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab record defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF-information of your original images will also be saved in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other color depth, you can change the color depth. of course, it also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnail image allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if error occurred during the creation. the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as filming, zooming or shifting. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been designed for fast image acquisition and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, an image is displayed as default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color information takes place. for example, this can also be found in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently does not have any documentation. if you want to change this situation please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then select the import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please check out exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packets MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow. after that, you can start creating the module using extras MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also modify the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you're satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to playback the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV default PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should let it black. the name and path of the generated file can be set under the name of the MPEG file file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences, you can start the production of the movie with the button encoding. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or in all rest enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you're back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that codiers or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages using the Settings button below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photoglobes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve you or print with the Gimp module for direct printout.</seg>
<seg id="853">This KIPI module lets you import or convert your images stored in RAW files into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original part of it is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window appears in the mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode the RGBG counter has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to process your pictures frequently or to use them later on, you should not choose JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion button to start conversion. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is useful if it was created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to convert all images into an album. it uses the convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 dim.): change of size in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is modified with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-press: prepare the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, margin size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images selected by you. you can add more images with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview is shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and place them in order to add you to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Remove images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the images, you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your e-mail client. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the images selected by you are attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't take care to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of e-mails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple messages if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The email window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration will be saved and used every time until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must enter the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu Pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted under the lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG among pictures file format and are the original files in JPEG format, then the original extract data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be automatically closed so you can view the status messages, on the search for errors, but your e-mail program will be automatically started at the end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL option in the presentation enables very elegant screen transitions using OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option filename displays the filename of the images shown in the lower left corner during presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. at random each transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">While Diaschau you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn you on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar, you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation currently. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected submenu option, as a background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have received your pictures and videos with notes, you can use & kphotoalbum; see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, now in each group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keywords entries are present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your pictures and videos with comments. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course viewing the actual thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you hit people with the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images are displayed on which both individuals are to be seen. this selection method allows you to restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can display thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can use it with a photoalbum; however, for each person you can store your own thumbnail, which of course also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined. see also the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display images next to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can choose which view you want to use for each category. it has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have any suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must define yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do so, you need to open the image-view window (in more detail) and select the image editor in the context menu. in the View window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you call the search in the main window, a dialog will show you a dialog, which is very similar to the dialog for defining the image properties. you can view this dialog at once.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string of characters in the label or description, the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e., for example in 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window, you can search all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for photoalbum;. if you do not like to read manuals, but rather try to try the same features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & use photoalbum; in the first dialog, select the demo, in case you start & use photoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry "photoalbum" in the menu. then, some sample images will be loaded and you can test the functions of photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of the photoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name implies, this strip shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can change between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can preview the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will appear in the preview pane) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select a range, you will only see pictures of this period in the thumbnail. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">Photoalbum; provides you with two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures. the one is in and photoalbum; integrated and the other is available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the integrated version will be described, which you can create via the File HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and destination. in the following, each section will be described in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on the photoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; -export file should be created on the overview page. learn more about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information displayed on the viewer is shown without description. for example, that all pictures are of a party. you can't use this setting to hide specific images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not addressed specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. thus, those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 will not download images, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you have defined. so it can browse your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, place the various folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a root folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you must select the root folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if they really are all visible to the viewer. if you select a URL for the root folder, a web browser will start. the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. so that the import function, see, properly works you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the root folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings you have just described are related to all three basic folders and URLs. a subfolder will be created in them, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you may want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time on viewing the images, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not do again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum, you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if there is only one link to pictures in the file. the advantage of all the images to be saved in the file is that you can share all the images and share this file so independently. however, the obvious drawback is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in a twofold manner. first, it searches the images that are located in the .kim file. if the images are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating HTML files will be searched. of course, this is only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for Export images can be described, which you can access via the File Export menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the manual, close to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With option Automatically copy to the .kim file copy & copy album; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. because most of the pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the option to compress the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send images to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu import... select, it will import and use photoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard to import consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personell the category persons of the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is named in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box, which categories of the importing file should be imported and which categories will match them in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported into the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will pass the various steps of (1) Determination of information about your images, over (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced subjects and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">PhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. but it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the topmost folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice, e.g. Normale backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions on CVS where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">Photoalbum; remember the folder in which your pictures are saved and automatically reuse it for future starts. if you want to read another database in a photoalbum, you can start & use photoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">"" "about the" "" "Create photoalbum" "" "menu item, set up... enter a window with which you can change the settings of" "" "photoalbum" "". "the following section of the user manual will explain the different settings options." ""</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you see six different symbols, with which you can view setting options of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which you can call by pressing the F1 key and a click on the option you want.</seg>
<seg id="953">It is described in detail how you can set different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to process existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in dialogue options, you can set up entire member groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group at once in a group rather than declare all groups of a member as explained.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the drop-down list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">Photoalbum; communicates its module system with other graphic applications such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of a photoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications together, it may be that the modules with a photoalbum can be tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures. you can either use the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. don't say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, making it possible for some modules to work with a photoalbum; this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between the photoalbum and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums: this is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This is simulated and photoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, we have to hand over a list of albums. here's a photoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you have defined in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category persons, will use photoalbum; so do, so if you have selected people to view it and share it with the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are with a photoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the Settings dialog and select in the area modules which modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & use photoalbum; start with your own images.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. below the toolbar, you will see the window with which you can browse your picture database. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the entry pictures showing you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of photoalbum; is the possibility to provide any image with notes. this includes information about the persons shown on the picture, where the image was taken. you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of images. if, for example, shown on all pictures of Jesper and all pictures taken in Copenhagen are included.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these comments by using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text field by setting up people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the shifting of images in the list: if you have a family celebration, for example, and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are pictured, you can, therefore, that the names used are moved upwards to find and assign the people more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with comments. in this case, simply click the above and back buttons which are located in the preview of the image to the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item add more entries at one time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window showing the USA as an overgroup. to show you that this is a group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the note dialogs context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also drag an entry to a category and place it in order to make it to a sub-category of this entry. attention, this presupposes that you currently sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the annotation dialog by clicking and moving the boxes that form the top edges of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it out of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options... which offers you among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame completely. if you want to see this window again later, use the options button... and here then window / hide. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in the browser, you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images, or all images in case you have no filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the thumbnail size by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will appear in the image viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and select either the Remove button or select the Edit menu in the Edit menu. now the window will display you that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">Photoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use and use photoalbum. you can also use images without saving you on the hard drive. of course, you have to record the images somewhere, so that we can record it in the database index. in the picture you see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is truncated is not saved on the hard drive. however, the thumbnail images are present for the images 5-9. however, you can preview these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from folders and copy them again. so, if you would like to avoid the insertion of the CD concerned, please buy a larger disk to save all the images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, you filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you accessible for others and click on current view lock in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also select all the pictures that your little sister can see, infuse and lock the menu item All except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give your little sister to your laptop, simply select the menu entry pictures, so all the images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which must be inserted to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select the password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. for one, all images on the hard disk and on the other can anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves to prohibit the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you want to describe all your pictures with photoalbum; manage and describe hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason has a photoalbum; about a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course, it shows the picture, but additional information you have entered through the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can easily drag them with the mouse and place it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is displayed at all. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer. the pop-up menu you can see below.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have downloaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the picture above and below. you can jump to the first and last image with pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. as often it loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl button and plus or minus. start and stop the slide through the Ctrl; S key.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is it able to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete seat on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can enter the image in and out. to zoom in, you can zoom out with the mouse a rectangle. with the minus button, you can zoom out the Plus button zooms into the middle of the image. it shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot key you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed zooms. with the Equal button the zoom puts the zoom, so that each pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations that work with videos that work in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make comments to the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image. at the moment you can view that image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to select only the image and look at more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad as you look one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to provide pictures with features as you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can make a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in the picture you see a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have set features on your images, these are available in the browser. so, if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you selected, just indicate all at once with annotations. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview view. if you want to display categories in the preview view, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the character after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case you can use photoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in the way you can reverse your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to view the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; switch on the painting from the context menu. to end the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully mastered but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">You can select individual objects in the object tree. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and displayed the object in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all sub-objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the toolbar icon or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed to enable you to select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Delete selected objects from the scene with delezing either from the menu bar or from the context menu of the right mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with a fault description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply on Apply or discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the Setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can preview the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as presetting the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render only one part of the texture (for example, a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), you cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen photo shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visibility level as a wire model. you can only display this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their level of visibility is less or equal to the chosen level of visibility in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window arrangement, or if you need another arrangement, you can set them arbitrarily. you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below an existing view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over one another, drag the starter in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the map frontrunner on the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window order is floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. in order to solve a view out of anchoring, drag the starter on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the button bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the address bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor it at any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view allows you to store window order... save it. a dialog appears in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene you can render them renders. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. when this manual was written, was & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on Rendering icon Rendering the toolbar or select the View scene menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full-quality images.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Render Modi menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that lets you recognize the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can insert the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the picture, select the crosssection subsection and enter the image cut to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the drop down selector quality you can select the properties used & Povray; this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflections lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual for & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture with just one beam per pixel is rendered, different errors can occur. these images often have a moir√®-pattern or scale effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called Aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn off anti-aliasing, calculates and combines & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super sampling the neighboring pixels with inclusion. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive, because each pixel is constantly split up and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels is overstepping the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) will be charged additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixels are divided into 4 sub-pixels that are individually tracked and checked for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you turn on shattering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; diffuse light reflexion is calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent, if the corresponding rays have not hit any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray image, select the menu entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not the full command start of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings occur when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support Source in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for & Povray. this includes the source code of the object in the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and pasting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor, you can paste source text for & Povray; likewise.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually, this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. here, set the path to your document and the version.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example, height-field data) in the paths to the & Povray libraries. if you include files that are not located in the scene file, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file appears in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The paint for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type labels.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects, such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross High detail fidelity for extended projections, all wire model views are further broken when the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to the projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a bottom is rendered under the objects. the bottom is shown in a checkerboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick Edge Control, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and threshold value can be adjusted. more details about the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window orders section explains how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop-down selector standard window arrangement: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window order when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all the views for the selected window order. new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, create a new column on the right-hand side of the existing windows, with Unten anchor the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a map view in common with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without any more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, very popular among beginners: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preset window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons. please read the documentation so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols often, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry Editing Delete. now you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply button or Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result you see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (Insert End User Quader) and set the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is an incomprehensible method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or Enter. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the layer, albeit at the moment only as a finite plane. if you render the scene, the plane extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree carefully, you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom if you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment preview only shows a matte black material because you need to make adjustments for the pigment yet. therefore, always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on Preview. also, there are many possibilities, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the header and ball in the preview, just click the Apply button and then preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now correctly adjusted. if you click on the icon with a click now, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the colors you have expected. here are further settings necessary. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select single-colored and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should simply execute, as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; already understood. the ball is just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of object properties, you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget the input button or the button applicator), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, as you moved the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering is now a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already at the ground, give the ball a pigment as colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first subobject and change the name for example in sphere of pigment. click ball pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen shots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities are you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraytracing is a rendering method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene raytraps, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam hits the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will affect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you have created previously with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not added any stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reversed command. you can only select this menu item if you use edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you can find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can use this option pre-set short commands for & kpovmodeler; change orders or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to create toolbars. you can use this option toolbox for & kpovmodeler; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a bump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Base bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these fundamental bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base, by using an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can choose images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files you can display with clicking the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image is to be displayed in your own window, or if all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a matching file name was found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog Einrichten - & kuickshow, there are five cards of cards. in three of them, General and Machining and Diashow, you can set the working method of & kuickshow; in the other two, short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the shortcut keys can be specified for each window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images are opened in full screen mode. if the image is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color that you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">This point is activated, loads & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image. this reduces the delay when you choose the next image and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You can set up existing multimedia buttons to work as & Amarok; make your keyboard to & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface from Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports Qt and & kde command line options; Amarok additionally has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of missing dependencies. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use the dialog to prevent the user from running a script.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialogue --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply add them to the required features. you will quickly find that writing scripts are relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow to run external programs and commands. in this way, the function exec () is usually used. this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; send notifications to all running scripts. for this reason strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should regularly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Expst the script to display the setup dialog. in order to save and load the setup data each script itself has to take care of. if a script is started, Amarok will set the folder to the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is popped up. the script could now pick up additional information on the new piece using DCOP functions (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume indicates a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemRead paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user defined menu item is clicked. to add an entry to the menu, you can use the dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemblem).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminated, or if the user stops a script sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do, for example, clean up data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amarok's script management can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the addition of amarachscript. for this reason, you should correctly designate your script packages.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is finished, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your listing on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>

<seg id="1229">The card-card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down selector. some drivers still activate further settings in this card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The Map Collection is used to set all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder into the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Recursively browse subfolders: this causes & Amarok; both the infected and their sub-folders to search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enables & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted), and an incremental search will be carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok; all found playlists in your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) add to your collection. the playlists automatically added will then appear in the playlist browser.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package kdelibs and no other KDE packages. so you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. therefore, Gnome will work, but fluxbox will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the taglib library for days. you can locate the file by viewing in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. after that, you can also delete the broken file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time it is because Taglib crashes reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the taglib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is something more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, taglib, but with GCC 3.3.X, this will lead to crash when processing meta information.</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very simple. drag items from the collection browser to the playlist. the small text box for filtering the collection makes it easier to search for specific pieces. if you are satisfied with the playlist, you can save it by using the playlist. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add it to the playlist browser. if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, and you have enabled the playlist option to import them, then these playlists are already in the tree view. with a right click on a playlist, you will get different ways to load playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To play an audio CD, in the menu bar, select actions audio CD. it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format. drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the button playback.</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; requires installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. in addition, some additional packages will be listed which make work with & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a packet management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player also has & Amarok; but a playlist that is superior to all. the playlist window contains multiple browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player window is your one-click & Amarok; control centre. at the top of the window you find a running text display that displays the current piece or the current stream. just below is the area, the game time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired play time for remaining playing time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the Player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the running text display. you can switch through the available analyzers by clicking the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, magnified window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the running text display, the PL and EQ buttons are also displayed. the button PL enables or disables the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set up Equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the piece position slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or the volume. playback buttons can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in Equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from Klassik to Techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you tick the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that there is in no other player. but don't be deterred by the abundance of features, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users is powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be modified with the help of context-browser design. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpreters. these three sub-windows are later incorporated into detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the subwindow has dropped off. the information displayed there now has been distributed to other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information can be collected in the statistics window (Extras Reports).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music shows information about the current piece, as well as the interpreters and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow shows information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, performer and the album. below you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to imitate the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz symbol. see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be located in the same folder as the current piece. file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are treated preferentially. the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to be displayed in the music subwindow. with the right mouse button click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text, the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites by using even written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if there is no text script running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping performer - group only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping performer / album - first the pieces are arranged by interpreters and among them another split is made according to the respective album. if you want to see constellation or soundtrack albums, this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list below Various Artists.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Group performer / year - Album - sorted by interpreters and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabetically sorted among each other. the interpreter is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / interpreter - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them, sorted by performer.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Group Genre / Interpret / Album - This attitude works as well as the above but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically capture your collection once you change something at the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly below the toolbar is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes about using this filter can be found in the playlist section in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The search filter is a selection box that allows you to filter the most recently added pieces to your collection, starting from the last 24 hours to a year. of course, you can also select your overall collection, whereby the filter is disabled practically.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This leaves the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Add the selected songs from the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry, you reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. thus, you will be playing next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as playlist... - Save the selected songs as playlist. you'll be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the queue for transferring to the Media Player. for more details, see the Media Player browser section.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - Through the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) move files to the M√ºlleimer... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, prompting it to be different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Compilation-Markings - Change a album marked as a compilation back into a normal album. the album is then no longer displayed under different interpreters but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser makes it easy to handle many playlists. among other things, it also contains intelligence playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Also self-created Smart Playlists are possible. click to add Intelligent Playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart Playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for the connection of & Amarok; with your portable media player (e.g. iPod). to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; if & Amarok; started, locate the pieces on your iPod to performer sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpret. if you're done, click Apply. thus, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. if the transmission is complete, exit & Amarok; and release the drive for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">The toolbar is a search area that allows you to search for a file. search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden that do not meet your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a set URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of the Shift key can be difficult. in this case, holding down the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically be inserted at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all items attached to you to play. you can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired place and drop them. as soon as you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters are displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter by whitespace separated search terms, & Amarok; search for entries that include all search terms. if you enter two three, search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you would like to search for entries that contain spaces, then close the search term with some goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will include entries tagged with Mike Oldfield, not after entries, such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and not include the commentary.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then press the right mouse button in the desired order to the entries. the entries will then be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist toolbar is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left hand, you will find the Add button to add to the playlist. to the right, you will find playlist, playlist blank and prone mixing.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons follow the undo and restore button. this allows you to revert or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the center of the toolbar there is a unique, magnifiable analyzer. the refresher rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that you get in the player window over the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example, playback controls and volume control. you can set up the buttons displayed by clicking on menu and setting up toolbars...</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total game time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and repeat performance is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the status bar option in general settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the list in the playlist. you can access & Amarok settings via this menu.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry will open the window visualisation plug-ins. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry is a sub-menu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what to be displayed in the cover management. select:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue administration got your big lettering in & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece in the queue, a number appears in the playlist next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">When you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can easily add the pieces to your mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>

<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD Copy Dialog. this allows even without project file to copy a DVD to another medium. alternatively, you can also create a copy of a DVD, which you can then burn later on. moreover, there is also the possibility of playing a DVD with the help of copying dialog, so the target medium has to be large enough to accommodate the entire (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this lets you delete the entire contents or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Open the dialog to formatting a DVD. with this dialog, you can format a DVD ¬± R (W) so that the content will be completely deleted. & k3b; lets you choose between the write modes overwriting and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">The dialog asks you for an * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported yet, but you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog will ask for an * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously read DVD video can be converted. this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used anywhere. it contains information about the read video, encoding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">This information is displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium, such as size and title length of CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of toolbars of & k3b; when an entry is checked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, their content is displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information, locks and unlock the disk or discarding the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The Content view allows selecting and dragging files into the project view. the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs, provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD was selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header bar has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box for changing the keystrokes for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key allocation for it further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup assistants. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrators are required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the Settings from & k3b; here, general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should function at startup. this dialog is for personalization and for fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program, or use the slightly more convenient Kdcop program. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so more your taste and style of your task is crucial, which of the programs you give denomance.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP, you must make sure that & k3b is started. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; -program common, supported & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other features for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () DCOPref createMovixCDProject () int formatDvd () void burnDvd () void burnDvdImage (italil url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPref (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be used on data-projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) int createFolder (QString name, QString [)] void addUrl (QString:: list urls, QString -) void removeItem (QString path, QString newname) void setvolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -readout for & kde; with it you can easily record audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder installed on the machine.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudioCreator; is the UI of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and many encoders who encoding these wav files (lossless compression) by default (These encoder packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution). additional codiers can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read out and stored into WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually a per title) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or also into other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other codiers must be installed. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything itself. however, only the encoder packages must be installed which are needed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoder / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to codiers, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection. in any case, & kaudiocreator; even do not handle the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid buying copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup dialog has to be done once (the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily approach to read a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, which you frequently stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without a network, where everything is manually recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. on the page step by step, for example, you will find more information on how this program is used, as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB query of the CD-data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case must first connect to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup directory - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default. it is to be noted that before the encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already read file will be selected instead of a complete & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure notifications (such as protocols, ports) for events (such as readout the & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (such as Encoder, for setting up the Encoders). here, you need to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are other such as' shorts' or 'monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can return these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences are less important as both codiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is nevertheless delivered free of charge with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality for lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playsets is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Enough for music of young people, portable devices and auto-stereosystems. but not good enough for better hi-fi devices.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset InSane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without paying attention to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information obtained manually or retrieved by the program automatically from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be transferred / used with & kaudioCreator; and to create the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD; titles to keywords (English: tag) when mp3s are encoded with lame, the switch-tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocopy; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database in which people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of themselves into the calculator. it is to note that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the CD; information available that is publicly available on the & CD; any information can be obtained from the artist or the music company. all information can be obtained anyway with a bummel by a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioCreator; actively select a check box. for the use of freedb can be used with another (counterfeit) address than the one in the system. in this type of configuration, so it appears, the email address will not be used by the server when retrieving the data (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudioCreator; for use of freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is needed. this saves bandwidth in the network and compares the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually generated per month) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which readout program is used to save pieces from the CD; to save into wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; those who want to know more exactly, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading Audio-CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package from the right distribution must first be installed if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read-off wav files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codierer package must be installed from the Linux distribution provided before the codierer can be used. this is also required for predefined codiers. more information about codiers are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, writing and reading genuine and whether both cdparanoia and the audio codiers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, setup everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists of and that you own write-up (eg; try to copy something into it using the Conqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what each triggering & CD must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used. since we are lazy, we share the program to download the freedb to download the data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it with each reading one & cd; if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program to read it the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, then a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of device designations for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The Map Card General settings. here you can't do much. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be stored and entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Select only in case of incomplete information, so that you will be notified when information about creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card Card CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a freedb machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop-down box is easier to find a & CD; associated entry will immediately start reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be changed easily. the directory and file name will be changed with Conqueror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb is not used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before. to use freedb in the offline mode, the two selections must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server via the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. put everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look after a mirror server in your vicinity. on this way, the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will function as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls bocking the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the 80, as the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to send data to the freedb server. deactivating the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously flashing pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, so simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard out of the last piece: check this to discard the CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you cross this, then / must the path / folder be specified in which the wav files are stored. if the box is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to make something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Just enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a little long, under certain circumstances, something has to be fed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the obtained compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting tags to version 1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files encoding simultaneously: a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as default for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard disk. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was written in the previous section, because we are comfortable and want to pick up the & CD; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each triggering & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screen photos look a bit different from that for a CD; with successfully obtained from freedb data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually enter instead of retrieving it from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, just like in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then search in the section Questions and Answers after the Help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully obtained from the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; a window is displayed and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have selected not the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in an input field 'Current Title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidividual per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor, so that you are not only happy with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help to the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obviously consistent with the style of the CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the CD; data anyway. for more information, go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are to be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second item.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD Editors window will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have typed all title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece into or out. make sure all the pieces are selected, or press the All Pieces on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the selection button to read out the selection process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we'll take a look at the window with the orders and track what runs out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">On the tab orders, click on the order window. it is located in the upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for checking the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is shown in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message appears when you try to work with a codierer you haven't yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and destination folders are not what we have typed here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for temporary files and destination folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, read and code parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found configuration settings to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. with powerful machines, the result is unclear. the machine used with an AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded and a third order is encoded in the queue of the encoding. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudioCreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. resp 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; is today maintained within & kde; CVS as part of the kdemultimedia package. however, most distributions are already included in a pre-compiled package, as & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & kde; package is. if you read this, you probably have already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to persons compiled by source files and not intended for users to use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help, how the program can be adapted to your needs, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that invokes many different programs has many variants of settings. it's best to read the step by step, for example, to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshot of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hi, still to read? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first-time launch of the program, without any clue as it should go on from this blank screen (especially if there is no audio CD at the time of program start), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? if you are reading this, probably the program has already started. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is considered the first version for a manual on & kaudiocreator; it is intended as the first version for a manual on the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Oddly, if you managed to get the source file from & kde; get SVN, then you don't need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaokespieler of & kde; besides others, it also has some features that other & UNIX users don't have with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support. & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver needed for GUS cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so that it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI canals by highlighting the pressed buttons on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop so that you can drag in & drop; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -windows to pull on kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files (real estate or text events). kmid automatically calculates the method used in each case.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you exit & kde; when playing a song, kmid starts again with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; drop window into the & kmid; this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button Play in the toolbar, select the item from the menu item or press the Leertaste.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece automatically starts when you drag it to the & kmid; (in several pieces, they will be added to a collection and then played after each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid, play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and driving back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display to change the speed. to get back the original tempo, double click the tempo LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar looks like a pressure on the button rest or selecting the menu item break in the menu, so interrupts playback. pressing the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use Textereignis, others use song texts and other both. some pieces have no lyrics: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can adjust which events should be presented and even better: the event type will automatically determine which one song uses, so that you do not have to adjust manually. so if you select the automatic text selection menu in the Settings menu, you will always have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify an event type, select the entries or property events from the Settings menu. the same function also includes keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files you summarize. in this section, you will see how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu collection under the item Organize. click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can choose each of them in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. consider when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can choose the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatically adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When Automatically adds to the collection, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using Open or Drag & Drop file).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically is not added to the collection, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the submenu sequence sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song further, select the next song button, the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song back, select the button Predicate piece, the entry Previous item from the menu item or press the Arrow key left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click on the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not general MIDI-capable. in this case MIDI-Map General MIDI events are translated into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and always lets a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand (using your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required compositions for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear, except the keymap section that may appear as often as desired. but the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different textid (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define keymap "Name of the keymap..." END define keymap "Another keymap..." END define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This topic describes how the patches of General MIDI can be mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun for example (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun shot. to do this, enter the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (rifle shooting), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is meant by the term Trommel-Patch of the patch, with which each tone represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of the lines is very important, as well as its presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map tones to the percussions-channel. see for example the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map out some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15 depending on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel which is mapped to the N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be used with the name name for this channel. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option may be useful for example to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions canal.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a Pitch-Bender event with the value n, this is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. the value 4096 is used so that no decimal commas can be found in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM gives a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards attempt to play two sounds up to an octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. this can be found in the Settings menu, point MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for every MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed one instrument, the knob will not shine more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, choose the channel view menu: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow down it. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, etc; and this same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs some 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Accept, therefore support & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror; select all files and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Do not check the Automatisches addition to the collection before. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key left from Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default speed, double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & conqueror; -Desktop a & konqueror; -Window with my MIDI-folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, just switch to & konqueror; move the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn the Automatisches addition to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. open files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the midi files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so set the Automatisches addition to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to further program & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; laga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I do not have a lot of spare time for my hobbies, but I still try to take a bit of time. as a hobby, I've programs, collect MIDI files, make music and prove propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: Larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really enjoy a great pleasure when you send me a postcard from your residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all that send me a postcard or a MIDI file will I get into contact with friends of & kmid (if you want to). before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me since I may have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; written entirely in my spare time and nobody gets money for it. I would like to point out that I can only programmer for that because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. B√ºhler - corrected the error that the pitch at AWE-cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Mr. Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Pfeffer, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, a bug notification or just a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, you can find & kmid; also found on his homepage, which is located at http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can track the development, search information and view images. you can also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid; compile MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you have a sound card, except that you can't listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send a bug notification directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files of formats supported by MPlayer or Phonon, as well as for playback of DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE Website to new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchical level. if you log in, your group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do that if & SMB. the various files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you must select the playlist from the menu and select either edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the edit mode is left or another group is selected without having to match the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during start-up does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would disturb the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; smilgt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; img dur = "meet" src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / gt; & lt; / smilgt; In the directory testing / some examples of SMIL can be supported by & KMPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the intermediate storage size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visibly.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; all must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, just like setting the backend via mimetype. here's an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even be added to the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can be played in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the configuration dialog file assignments of KDE must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & SMB Player; is to start in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend issue is available within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that always a given backend for a certain mime type is taken (of course only if it was determined), this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. for this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog can be used in the settings below - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected (for example, it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. for the XFree86 server, the following must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, KMPlayer uses different names for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, pipesouce, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. when enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there a hint how I can quieter my CDROM drive if I play from it (not from the VCD / / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be run as user root after installing the device. it is absolutely safe to make sure / dev / cdrom drive on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts slowly, why does every time my CPU has to be checked for their performance?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overtaking. kxineplayer will automatically need the last stored value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1751">Here's just a good explanation of & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book about it. to be able to speak correctly, good books should be used e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just like other drawing languages contains & latex; an introduction with which the general characteristics such as paper format, page numbering and text green e are defined as well as a body with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ start {document} and must be closed with the command\\ begin {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Step wizard by & Kile; is a useful feature for speedy preparation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (menu) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this sets the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], book [book], report (DIN) [scrartcl], report (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrreprt], projector [more], films [prosper] or custom.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Coding: the character encoding is set. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add-on packages for & latex; for the integration they are only selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), Book (DIN), Report (DIN), Brief (DIN): the document classes of KOMA-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users do not have to worry about. it is merely a short description of the functions and further information about this is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Cile; offers - as well as other source code editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). by & tile; if you see green areas of a green text on the screen, it is likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed. however, you have noticed it by the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic completion of the environments, by entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & tile; automatically creates a blank line (for input of the text) and the added line to the closing of the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be disabled in the Men√É ¬º Settings... LaTeX commands are deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the document to be divided into the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful. once a DVI file is created, navigating & tile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI, viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; -Source.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI / file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as font and is beside PDF the usual output eart of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, convert and print from DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the reset search, the elements of the DVI-file are plugged with the editor and once on an element in the DVI-file. the default search is the exact opposite of it. once you clicked on a section in & latex; -Source text clicked at the appropriate place in the DVI, viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set for project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick cultivation: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless errors are available in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">‚Ä¢ File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI-file is built on unplugged forecast√¢ ¬¨ settlements and there is no call of & eyepiece; after the quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the edit toolbar, the three large selection boxes should be noticed. the selection fields were developed for the fast introduction of common elements into the document. the first drop down box is for quick breakdown of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The verf√É ¬º gbaren & latex; -commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">"" "the" "" "Other" "" "selector is for inserting items such as keywords, fuel notes, or references. the available possibilities are:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a name for a section, an image or other element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Cover: used for reference to a specified term (selection over a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for the editing of & bibtex; files are necessary editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can of course also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop down selector with the name Gr√É ¬∂ √É ¬∂ is is used for defining the font size. it can be specified for the main text, the groudes, etc. it contains the following letters to be used:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, there are two options available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written by reason on hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] sets the font. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the simplest way to do this is the use of the men√É ¬º s construction or the Knopfs Schnellbau.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Cile; it executes the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document compiling fails, it should be searched after the errors. when using quick construction, the eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font green e 12 is created and only a few places should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ huge and\\ end {environment} has then created the arrangement of the fonts within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are notified only within the environment (of\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and usability of the document. for example, there may be certain fonts, grease pressure, italics, submissions, etc. these commands end either using the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for italics and is valid as long as it is closed by a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in one sentence can be displayed recursively with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quota: creates a quote in the document. the quotation begins with\\ begin {quota} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; -drawing language is shown, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the wizard a bit of text was entered, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be performed. this should include a quote, a few places in fat and italics and a poem for the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor-view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer). an external viewer has to close the window.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed out or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI-file, the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed using file print (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar enables the transformation of the DVI-file into other formats. once the DVI-file was created from the & latex; -Source text, the conversion into unwanted other formats can start using the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The default search allows direct jump from the editor to the added position inside the DVI-file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Cile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; binaries. to do this, only Modern should be set up under Settings Kile... tools construction will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to perform the pre-order search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a row of the source text and clicked on pre-order search. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI, viewer takes place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; open and skipped to the corresponding line. to do this, & Cile; in & Okular; set up as text editor (settings eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If the & DVI connection is using, an error can be found. if an error is present, this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file attaches the source of errors in the source code. in the editor, the syslops predictions and mistakes can be used for jumps between errors. the log file always gives the line where the error appears. to view the faulty line, the error must be clicked on the error in the logging and & Cile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the button is clicked on the toolbar, a window will appear to choose the template to be used for the document. the preset possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard for quick creation of a new document. for more information, please refer to the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be written in & tile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or create a new file. & Cile; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a new file, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings cile... settings General are set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by typing in the document class. typically it is used as follows:\\ $DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document is created in this way, the following steps have been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created in a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the internet and can be performed under described steps.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Cile; uses & works; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and emphasizing many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be made in the Men√É ¬º Tools straight out & tile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & unique; and to experience its possibilities, the guide to Kate should be used. users of & Kile; can begin directly with the reading of the chapter works with the editor of & kate; start.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Cile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be invoked by the Help LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; that means that clicking\\ par\\\\ bigskip will only be selected\\ par by\\ par\\ bigskip.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed SHIFT key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Cile; has the possibility to browse the different types of source texts and emphasize them. for example, the & latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can incorporate additional sprinkling brands. this is their own type of bookmarks within the text. the menu entries do jump on branding or the corresponding keynote mark. this is also highlighted by this jump-mark, so that it is automatically logged in the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & tile; although & kate; already outstanding possibilities offered, have been added in & tile; important functions for writing a & latex; & latex; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; -Commands and all other lines of the source code. the only preventive matter in & Kile; is that the scorgins are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning since this command is also & latex; -commands with a back-line-line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be initially selected and removed by pressing the Del key. & kate; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & Cile; offers with own commands here for a faster possibility. under Edit Remove the following commands are included to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & tile; is included in the description to edit the heaters paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & tile; for more commands under Edit Surroundings for one possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command you will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lock the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, is injected to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many waxed environment commands, the √É ¬π s view can quickly be lost. this command locks the last environment, so that the chased surrounding structure is not distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Cile; also offers special commands for & latex; groups that are determined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that match those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the curly opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly clamped clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the curly clasp of a & tex; -group #, is injected to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">During the input of many waxed braces bonded brackets can quickly get lost sight of. this command locks the most recently opened group, so that the chased structure of the & tex; groups will not be torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex, two simple quotes are used as g√É ¬§nseam. for the purpose of the implementation is used in & tile; the character is used for two simple quotes.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insertion of double attachment marks can be set up under Settings... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use foreign-specific settings (e.g. ngerman or french) and therewith German or French quotes. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift, Enter & Cile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (such as enumerate or itemize), & Cile; not just a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a spreadsheet area integer t & Kile; the current line with\\\\ with an adjacent newline break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & tile; is intelligent enough to support preset & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be set under Settings... LaTeX will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to classify the columns in tables -environments and thereby all Et-sign (amp;) among each other. when pressing Shift, Alt; amp; search & tile; after the next tabulator in the above line. although this tab is not the added, for the columns position of the current tab.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already offers a good source code complete, it has been added to & Kile; for special orders (usually for & latex;), three are installed for automatic completion. all these modes can be set for different modes of operation under Settings Kile... fully adjustable.</seg>
<seg id="1839">Starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} will & cile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to set up the complete list. on the other hand, the list can also be smaller by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions will be frozen when selecting a command. alternatively, skipping marks can be frozen, so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible by means of machining marks, and the required parameters can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; set up... tile; all settings can be made to these lists. there can be different W√É ¬∂ rterlisten for & tex; - and & latex; -instructions as well as W√É ¬∂ rterb√É ¬º cher of the general language range are selected.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not necessary for fulfillment of environments. a few letters with\\ begin should always be entered and the execution mode is called a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are often used to provide a special mode for understanding the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When invoking the fulfillment Mode to the fuller environment or the key-key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically set and it appears\\ begin {. afterwards, the environment can be continued in the simplest way and terminate by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile; realize that it is a listing area, even a first\\ item command will be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; set up... tile; all settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the W√É ¬∂ rterliste des verf√É ¬§ndigungsmode f√É ¬º r & tex; - und & latex; -Commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Cile; supported user-defined lists of queries that are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... cile can be set up. as an example of a storage list, the file example.cwl, in which for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L entered and the word processor mode is initiated by the Edit Settlement or the key Ctrl + Alt Emptaste, the character L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large-scale W√É ¬∂ rterb√É ¬º cher are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been noted that many W√É ¬∂ rter are written in a document more than once.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Cile menu... tile amplifiers can be sworn down. here too the threshold for displaying the completion can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / patches / complete / mode / of the Persian Home folder. mode is for abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (W√É ¬∂ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The dialog graphics are designed to capture graphics as easy as possible. to verify the basics of graphics formats, the sections should be considered and respected.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and rearrangement of pages. if the PDF output is installed, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to be able to examine the result of the work, the source code needs to be compiled. all construction tools are grouped in the Men√É ¬º s create compile, create transformations and create view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compilation of the source code for viewers such as & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used the keyword Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI-file can be used in the standard viewer using Alt; 3, by means of Alt; 4 the DVI-file is converted into a PS file and by using Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Schnellbau command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no built-in viewer is used, each time a new window will open.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project becomes the Men√É ¬º Project New Project.... here the following information is asked for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When filling the filename window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & Kile; allows the executing of ECMAScript code. the scripts can be administered by scripts in vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of & Kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the implementation environment of the scripts in & Kile; a system-wide object (= tile) has the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a well established system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages. & Cile; offers a lot of different help to support users.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texlive; are supplied with many documents. this includes a documentation for the packets contained and another & latex; reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">It is not only a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather a complete instruction manual for the & latex; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific formatting. since it is a very large document, it is divided into & tile; in three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents with which & tetex; / texlive; delivered, the finding of the right document is not always easy. as possible help provides & tetex; / texlive; the small application textilt, which contains a database with all the available documents and for a graphical surface.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the green advantage is the search for package names or strokes. by & Kile, only the results are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1867">Double-clicking with the mouse or pressing the space button opens the viewer for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1868">& Kile; is a quelloffener and user-friendly & latex; - / tex; source code editor that can be used on all systems with installed & kde; work space. & Cile; is also part of the Fink project, which makes & Kile; also available on & Mac; installed with installed OS-X.</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this is done by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold according to which you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the attitude of their own identity are important in terms of news and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team there is another benefit from the collection of members of the team: it can be created an event for information on team leaders when something particular happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens in the project. one example would be recording the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone was working on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file into the CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the site Configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Project Settings dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>

<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags, including car complete, it can be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal size / lowercase means the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal size / lowercase means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional Tags automatically close: if checked, for tags, for which the closing day is optional, this is immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and finish tag automatically update: when switched on, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accentuated characters into the corresponding encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detection of different types of files. using button Standard, the default specifications can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the coding of newly created files or in a different way than with open open file (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting will be stocked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Default DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been recognized. however, this setting will be removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that during the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. even for not stored documents, a backup is created regularly, according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in one's own view (or documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to default when the next start is useful when the user interface changes through modifying the MDI modes and andocks / dependencies on each other. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning messages range is used to control the control of warning messages through hooks of non-demand.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and the source code view in divided mode. regarding the different modes, see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, which represents the illustration of the parser knot in the document, can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the field of structural tree settings, the visibility of knots in the tree, the updating frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in a change of the structure tree will be automatically opened. empty nodes are empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those with which no item has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for setting abbreviations (a type of templates) that are unfolds when editing to larger text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ifclause abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins are KPart applications from third party, which can be reused by any KPart-enabled application, best known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following should be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located at a default location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information will be transferred to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "component in" "" "Read-only" "" "mode: check if the plugin refuses the load. only-Lese-KParts usually refuse the load if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then testet & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct, you can choose to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely re-developed. support for the non-needed built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was discontinued, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a Debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the options button next to the Debugger plugin selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all stops, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger if necessary, or it shares the plugin to listen to debugging requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so that normally it does not have to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the noise according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Send a HTTP request to the server to launch a debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request will be displayed in the Debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continually send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if this happens before a debuck is started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution will continue. if this happens before a debuck is given, the execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next script in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next script in the script, where possible in functions and include in the script.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Tells the debugger to pass the directive and go to the next one as if there were not the current ones.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the tag shows. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag files are nothing but folders. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carry the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declare if they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but an element type about itself otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day. (only Family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. in addition, it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Returns the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a pattern name and a method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, that means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that groups the elements of a list together. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in dialog. this tag should be present for each field in dialog (e.g. for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools Dialog at the top of the & quantaplus; to start window and select TagXML. dialog. another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check is performed only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for reachable via DTD editing DTD settings. this can be edited diedescriptionrc; for a & descriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = solstice 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD indication. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name will be used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... to be created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key breviation assigned to this action. by clicking the Custom button, a shortcut can be assigned; with K1 the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be inserted a text in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that will change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document). examples of & quantaplus; themselves are the quickstart dialog or the various See in... Actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way try & quantaplus; the script at the following places: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we have replaced the URL of the current document. in the case of a local document file, file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text will be added to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be input from & quantaplus; in the drop-down box, input can be specified, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be diverted. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the default output; error messages, written to the default output. it can be specified, what should be done with the text written to the default output, by setting the output box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, there are not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the tag.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to specify actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window will start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the day attributes has attributes and you plan their use, enable "Edit Tag" dialog box when available so that you can enter the action when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we & kiconedit; use. choose from & KMenu;, Graphics Other Programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Editing size to others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol is not only helping you remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking on this symbol is & lt; start; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be connected with the action. this is done via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so it is still there, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview. open the toolbar to set the toolbar dialog. make sure the toolbar you want is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that should be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator supports the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the & Conqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by sample of all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">If NeueXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please customize & descriptionrc, so that your toolbar (s) will be loaded when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language that you like best. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, check in & quantaplus; check if someone has already done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, for the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # items in the main index Top element = your description for these documentations, e.g., Section1.html section 2 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Section1.html Sec2.1 = funce.html Tag1 = tag1.html tags 2 = tag2.html tags 3 = tag2.html tags</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see in the & PHP; documentation thus something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a sub-folder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the carton boots (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents directory is referenced directly to a file (and logically shown at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The portion section is the area of the docrc file that is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is indicated. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (Context List) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation has been used to the & quantaplus; repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the separable resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via e-mail to friends, partners or anyone else. at different locations there is an E-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP), send the toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripted tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the other & quantaplus; -users can download them. the contributions are checked and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. to make an waffle, we recommend to sign the resources for what it needs a GPG / PGP key. this will ensure the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their passphrase for their private gpg key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the New resource dialog, the input fields must be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD Package (DTEP) menus, upload toolbar toolbars, and start in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the statement of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in the tagXML format. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file using the DTD description which should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folders.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the string that is in! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand and understand the full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarise themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring them closer to these concepts without their understanding and quantaplus; little use would bring.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for anyone who uses & quantaplus; all that is marked global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which then are available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development agents for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, making the common use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the building mansions, the map files with information and the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the flashtrays with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document's current document, recharge, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor area lead to another contextual menu with respect to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), edit the tags representing under the mouse cursor, or opening the file if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; in your document, click on the tag that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in various fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Baumansichten (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; navigate, open and browse through. in the presentation with map files are available for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation building views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu that was displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; Everything is open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on what connection they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; working area. global templates are always available, local templates are only available for the relevant user and templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the scripting languages available. the concept of spin-off in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the information available to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree will open.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other buildings. with it you can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the application-oriented entry system allows you to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added, edited and viewed project specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two waiters at the bottom of the window, can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all modifications to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the Markup of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Die & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them to a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; send the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive by & kmail;. if you get a toolbar in an email, you can back it in & quantaplus; like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the & quantaplus; files on your system. autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH is located in front of their bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While striving to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable Markup Language editor would? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML, then & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why developers, what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffold is not only possible but allows users and developers to expand, as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows Web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the details go with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta run).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and managed by Eric Laffoon sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not located where the oldest entry is taken.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if you try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard there contained special characters to & HTML; expulsion, so that they are correctly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as a formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; expulsion, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily for inserting & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to or from. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift; key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages exist!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Exit and turn off the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set Bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; -projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this lets you copy video files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be set by settings actions... to be added. toolbars will be saved using toolbar toolbars or you'll be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new EMail message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of toolbars to the main server, where anyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; that you or someone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP should be refreshed without renewing the entire & DTEP; if this is global and does not exist in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag setup dialog, if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or disables the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this works only with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting the toolbar is refused if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items mentioned above. click on it. click on an activated plugins deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available origin schemata depends on the original version; -Version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line ending identification. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; by using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between the different types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching times may sometimes need time or cause unpleasant graphics. recommended is the card-card mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode which matches the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will enable the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect every application using the KHTML-Part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar or which you can add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse cursor, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled up from above downwards, for example, after completing the project name, the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering the name file, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without blanks with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine you want to access, except you process local data. either a name (hostname.examples) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project. you can select multiple files or entire folders.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change. in case of serversed scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Allow files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project. if a project is started anew, not hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection of manners.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the sub-window profiles or changed using the key Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders possible) which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, even files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when opening the project, can read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to select the desired debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button. in this case, troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles high loading profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile, by creating a custom built-in view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted, as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration window, one can turn event actions and add these actions, change or delete events. event actions are executed when a specific event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened. you can't influence this behavior at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project open... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project opens and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, however, the entries are missing and opened with... in the right-click on-button context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can find different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Enables removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is stopped to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten in the program window. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk will not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety wave, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use them according to your discretion. the password is stored on the disk so that it can not be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply deleting the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the project or project toolbar, accessible via the toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has the most to do. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars are available in & quantaplus; preferably using the toolbar menu. use and addition distinguish. the addition of toolbars is treated below in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Toolbars and symbols can be configured either using context menu (right-clicking on the toolbar) where new action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbars can be removed, toolbar renaming or toolbars can be executed, which can be displayed in the dialog where actions on this or other toolbars should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, additional entries will be removed and action shown that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up menu toolbars in the menu... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code snippets and files for connecting. & quantaplus; basically uses templates like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any directory existing on the system into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in roughly the restrictions placed on the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binaries are all that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually included in documents via links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, special documents are created in appropriate subfolders. a simple scaffolding for the purpose and organises the work in a corresponding way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the storehouses under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful, if not a new document is to be inserted in the document based on a template, but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As template save As local template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that is done, notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save selections as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be dragged with drag & drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: just copy the file into a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as drag & drop or pasting over the Conqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project file tree view to create a name for the template and secure it. by default it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates provide a very target-oriented approach. you can submit headlines and footers or dynamically connect with & PHP; create, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep a few things in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, click the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is finished when elongated attributes has been inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and adapts for everything except the root folders in the Template table. if a root folder would be configured it would generally disable templates in this path unless they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general headers and footers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying of content templates to a folder with special headlines / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (point, press right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source editor, which can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the editor window in two parts: the source code editor and the VPL. editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -Page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back to source code editor in which the changes made in the VPL are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document called & PHP, a small green symbol indicates the Vohanddefault of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL. to edit & PHP, the source code is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes in the source text editor and the VPL are visible, and the cursor is activated in the source text editor and in the VPL. with pressing F9, this mode is active, the push-button puts the active cursor from one window to another, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL and the source code editor is configurable via Settings Quanta. after selecting VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast calculators and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, tools document properties can be selected. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the VPL. this is used to reduce the h√§ndian encoding. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows the change of the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is possible just as with the meta elements. editing of CSS rules is not currently supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File-open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible like in a word processor, because of the arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves strange. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted by means of a button or removal button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar, as in the source code editor. it is to note that inserting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. when a anchor tag, enclosed with text, must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the table wizard or the list wizard are deactivated. you will later work in the VPL; in this release, the tables or lists must be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for examination of style sheets. unlike other style sheets programs, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style sheet can be followed.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the recess at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare quickly text, just copy it to the clipboard and add it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made much work was the same and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently from one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; at folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& cdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more anger when somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red Color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by simply typing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Ordner1 Ordner2 Ordner1 Ordner2 -o Zielfolder kdiff3 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog provides the manual typing of file names, the selection via the file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. open dialog will notice your selection and display it next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the Folder folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge of folders will be initiated. if you select a folder, for B and C, however, a folder then uses & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is checked, the input field is active for goal and can be processed. however, it is not strictly necessary to set an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting the merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard to the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the open dialog, you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag & drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how much these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you just need to create two related files, load them into & co-3; now, you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at present, you cannot remove anything from & co diffuse; only the drop from text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag & drop of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Each info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest a while above the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed over the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one sees the color that differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that is good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">If differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare single cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no rows. if the line break is activated, the line is scored points dotted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison window) also has a info line with the inscription:, the filename and [edit] if you edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons to find the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown. this group will also be the current group. it will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manual machining; this is only a placeholder for the case that you change your mind and you may choose another source. this text will not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marker that you may copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources ignore the options Numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating mainly with the pictures and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click on one of the windows you can use the arrow keys on the left, right, high, down, side, side down, beginning, end, Strg-start and Ctrl end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in section merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture Away / Ctrl-Picture Abw√§rts) or to the next / previous / unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the markings to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). there is also the option selection automatically copy. if this is checked, whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clipboard and manually copied. be careful with this option because you might override the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are saved according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not retain the line ending of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved when you exit and restore the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences will be displayed in italics. if the chosen typeface does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered astert. on these systems, the button presets automatically create an unprocessed colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tabulator button. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press input or return, the entry of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard. the manual copy into the clipboard will then drop.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used option on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files try & kdiff3; first, all fully identical lines are found in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters will not be ignored. even when merging white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return number '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of one line, and other in turn only save a line feed '\'. usually, the risk returns are made visible, but as a white sign may be dealt with. during merging this option has to be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are nevertheless displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively searching for even smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic re-jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Triggers automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important. if you do this only from time to time, then use better the functions W√§hle A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on scanning of folders and executing a merge. check for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version is attached to the suffix .original. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .original, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need & co-diffuse; stop and restart to make the change active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set global over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection boxes for the encoding appears a short notice of what the local code is. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to specify the encoding output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch on this to suppress changes in white characters in text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are shown in a color-encoded oversight column. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will appear next to the normal still a second oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just stop the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arrange the comparison window next to each other or above. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes consider the differences and then decide unexpectedly to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge operation, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first be given to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that meets your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut disruptive parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is first given to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), the output of the command is used only at the line interval. you can write your own preprocessor that meets your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to allow users more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command for line input to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\).\\ U converts the text found in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experimenting with sed, you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they're very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for line spacing. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / release / SCHALTER 'However, some details are different at perl. where sed\\ (and\\), perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are retained for the display and for merging. the other operations only change the data that the Zeilenabgleich algorythmus sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the sequencer preprocessor looks for the output of the standard processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hide differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge the entire folder recursively with & kdiff3.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can customize the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate merging and shows the simulated changes without really performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... executes selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and merge of individual files. you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder was specified, uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders only the files that were compared to that date will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is finished, displays & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can fold up a folder by double-clicking on + / - or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu includes two functions All sub-directories and fold up all subdirectories with which you can open up all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file comparison will start and it will appear a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merging action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the column A / B / C uses red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as identical if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronizing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified and if the option disynchronize directories is active. then select & co-diffuse; then select the necessary action so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; copied directly after merge & co-diffuse; B by A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge (unsafe) is checked, then examines & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different but the same date appears, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical..</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file is executed after another. the status column shows Fertig when merging was successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if merging is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog, KTaglib will display further columns. these contain the number of unsolved, deleted, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only shown if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odd), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merging actions (including in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, C is used as a destination in the Three-folder merge mode, when it is selected as a target for a two folder merge, and when synchronizing A and / or B will be used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries should be in the destination folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options that could be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: start / continue directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to create only the current entry, select action of the current element, or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears that points to the erroneous elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window will display the options through, simulate and cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">Once you are finished with a file, select / continue directory merging / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then execute & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to remove the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), let & kdiff3; you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before you continue with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and does not merge them again at the later merge of all entries. even if the merging has been skipped or not stored, these entries will be considered completed. only if you change the merge operation, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (set up Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid Placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h).</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autoptically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set specifically with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a hidden attribute. in other filesystems, a previous point is marked. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is disabled, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links will be treated as normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; does not examine possible recursions. a link to a folder of a link on itself would lead to a final loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays statistic columns. (the number of dissolved, unresolved, non- white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when it is applied to files that do not contain any text. (specify a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security. please use caution. this option is deprecated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. no real comparison takes place. the files are considered to be identical if they are equal to size. this can be useful e.g. when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is deprecated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected, so that after both folders are identical. also, the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, copying the newer file as an action is proposed. (this is considered insecure as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too. you should check this in any case.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .original. if an old backup file already exists with the .original extension it will be deleted without further backup. this also concerns the normal merge of individual files, not just the merge entire folder. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge view will remain visible during the merge of individual files. if you don't want to, you can shift the list & text box to the main window in the window menu and switch between the list & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu item. you can also directly merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder merge. to do this, use the Current file merge from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost when you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KTaglib uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished from displaying a link to a file or folder. then a file is always assumed as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or change date depend on the original. (note the option Trust of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose in use is currently available as differences viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in differences viewer. to start KDEVELOP, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In KDifford display from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & co-diffuse; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a Part, takes & kdiff3; suppose that the input file is a patch file in unified format. at least one of the two files must exist. then & kdiff3; then starts & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is performed, it only supports comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now called Kompare) are already available. in addition, the name KDiff3 suggests that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go like that.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably did not tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default configure installed configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identically; however, if only one non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identically. if related lines appear next to each other, this actually is coincidence but this album is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it finishes. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to design extra a separate file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort required has been too large so far. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to process larger volumes of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src left; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system; use the following command in the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should not have any problems with compile. however, if difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; -mailinglists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Strg-X or Shift-Remove) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. paste (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the folder with the update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">It will also show that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merged. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after the merge. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose the source with the lettering A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop, change their size, finish them or move them. this works both inside a working area as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual workspace as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager. the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu only displays the two entries. if, however, click on an application within & Kpager. if, however, click on an application within & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is checked, in & Kpager, the names of the virtual workspace are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is checked together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1. place of work.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is checked, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager. otherwise only the empty fields are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window will be determined: classic lets & pager; in a 2xn grid, appear as from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal displays all virtual desktops in a horizontally and vertical row, which is very good for displaying on the side on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini-program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set the switch to switch... the dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the dialog settings. but you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like & kedit; or vi. if you do not have a write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator. in this file you must enter the key windowTransparentMode and assign it to a value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kimag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions. it is optimized for use on performance-sensitive machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you use & kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & kmag; shows the enlarged area of the screen. the image shown in the magnifying window is a magnified area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window in the following.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click once the mouse cursor persists for a while at the same place. it is meant to help people suffering from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and those of every mouse click pains pain. furthermore, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, the mere reason of mouse pain may cause pain. if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify it once again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain arising when you click with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and execute a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is enabled, power & kmousetool; a pause after it emulates the mouse button. now move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. this way you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shifting requires a little exercise, but you get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This setting time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If the mouse button is switched on, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is active. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool. after shutdown the mouse button waits before it takes the mouse button again if no result of the mouse occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the click through mouse displacement. if this function is enabled, a slow moving leads to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. this moves will be saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, if & kmousetool; the first time it is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears delayed, you can & k; move to shorten the reaction time. to do so, go to Sound & Multimedia, select there sound system and here the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at any start of & kde; start. this feature is currently only available under & kde; please consult the respective documentation for GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the state after the last press release.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the intelligent postpone should be switched off at first. if you are accustomed to the automatic mouse click, you can later increase the intelligent move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware at which places a mouse click stays without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not show a link leads to unintentional reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty easy. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take the mouse ball out. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the wheels. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and dirt can be scraped easily with a flat blade or fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool. if you are using the intelligent slide in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want to have it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of desktop when you want to make a keyboard input. secure zones for mouse cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent postpone, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shifting is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very well possible in this way to mark text, copy it into the clipboard and then insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse at pressed mouse button. however, you will probably have problems first. here are some advices:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool. instead, select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. thus, each time you play & kmousetool, the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when when it comes to intelligent shifting the shooting time begins. later, you can use the intelligent move even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool to use, the XTest extension for & X Window must be installed. that should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker, and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; pressed the mouse button shortly after the mouse-cursor persists. this program has been developed for people suffering from the RSI syndrome and the operation of the mightiest pain prepares.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced abilities of & ktops; for normal work with & ktops, filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Filters are processed in filters before being sent to the 'speech' label 'program. they are useful for improving pronunciation to replace untamed words or shortcuts, select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain shortcomings of voice synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working method of filtering it is important to know how the program 'speech-Dispatcher' works with a text. & ktops; differentiates four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is withdrawn from all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Alerts have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and plain text. these orders are continued after the output of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you can read a long text on a web page, you can greet with & kmouth; someone who just enters the room. & kisde; notifications are also messages.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you encounter orders from the map card is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktops; just one such reads, this output will stop and terminate.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen reviewers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are implemented as modules. in the future there are still more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Drawers replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktops; is supplied with predefined strings (such as: -) by text or for the conversion of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; transformers use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktops; some XSLT files are included for translation of & XHTML; contained in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text, or depending on the program that sent the text to the text. for example, if you have set a female voice on the map card, you can read the text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it will continue to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; be sent, it is processed by all activated filters which were set up on the bottom. editing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the next setup dialogs will be displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">You will need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison tool for setting of string insertion filters. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be exchanged against the corresponding substitute text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name at any time, it must be different from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with strings in the column matching and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list will be processed in the shown sequence from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries will be attached from the file to the existing list.</seg>

<seg id="2644">If a value is entered, the filter will only be applied if the text is from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separately by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs get you with the program qdbus;. the & DBus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID Kopete-3432 shows, you may only enter copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string substitute filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the box Diesen filter if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string translation filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. thus, the words must be limited by separators (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual, you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. but if you have installed the & # 160; regular & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can use it in the dialogs, or edit them as help to assemble these expressions.</seg>

XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such conversions. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is reachable via the PATH environment variable, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaker selection filter, you can send text to a specific speaker, which is set up on the card holder, or to a speaker with specific features. you can, for example, specify that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktops; a text is handed over to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected by the speaker characteristics that the program sends the text to & ktops; sends, and the characteristics of the speakers decorated on the card. with the speaker selection filter, you can override the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered, the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression. is installed on your system of the & # 160; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it by clicking on the button to get help from entering.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The 'speech-Dispatcher' program uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to extend & check for using another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used to support SSML and for the XML, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including packages kdelibs and development files for the 'speech-Dispatcher' program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you refer to the source texts of & ktts; from source archive for kdeFondo or download the tarball, currently generated each night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & ktops, check first if speech dispatcher works properly with your voice synthesizer. you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktops; the program kttmsgr should be developed in such a way that the set-up of speech discs is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed into individual sentences. the user can leave the propositional or set-up, repeat, stop or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application gives text to & ktts, it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for output. if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender feminine, it will be used, otherwise the best matching speaker will be selected. if you want to learn more about how & ktops; a speaker chooses, you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on Adding on the Map tab, and then insert a speaker into the list or click Edit, the Map tab will be displayed. as an example, the configuration of the module for festival Interactive will be shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival programme. if the path to festival is contained in PATH, you only have to enter festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that is handed over to the festival. in case of voices, the & ktops; known, this setting will be made automatically. in general, Western languages are using ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovakian use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you can adjust the volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controls and this gray will be displayed, the voice you choose doesn't show these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded several seconds because of their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that (with larger memory usage) the first set will be synthesized more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forgot to click Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window kttsmgr is displayed at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, only the symbol kttsmgr is visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is marked and kttsmgr does not run, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the job, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the straight edited sentence. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card holder.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this series, you can proceed or return from the order placed in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK all changes of the settings (also on the other map cards) are taken over and kttsmgr is reduced to the icon in the system section. then click on this icon to display the program window again.</seg>

<seg id="2699">If GStreamer or aKode is to be used for audio output, select the audio output here. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you must install at least one module. if you selected ALSA, select the PCM device here.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Adjust the speaking speed here. 50nbsp;% corresponds roughly half and 200bsp;% about double normal speech speed. to enable these settings to be implemented, the program must be sox installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to take over the new settings for the current & ktops.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules installed in your system. most of them will not work. you have to figure out which device works with you. in doubt, select standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this map you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted from a message with higher priority. & ktops; processes four types of language assignments:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is withdrawn from all other orders and stops these orders. after the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Alerts have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and plain text. these orders are continued after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks out messages. if you are & eg; just let a long text read on a web page, you can communicate with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen reader, add & ktops; the audio output to the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders. for messages, warnings and screen outputs, there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktops; KNotify messages, start kttsmgr and click on notifications. the card card will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Tick this check box to turn off & collect; notification feature. if this setting is not checked, the other settings are disabled and stored; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, notifications in which a sound is played is written by & ktt; not read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. if you click the Add button, a dialog appears in which you can select the application and event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message before, the & conversation; sends whenever someone in an IRC message mentions your nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events, for which nothing else is stated in the list, are ignored by & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this field to specify what & ktops; do if an event occurs. you have the following options:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected user-defined text, enter the desired text. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter here the properties of the desired subscriber. default selects the speaker that is displayed as the top entry in the list on the Map tab. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application, this action is executed. otherwise, the action is executed for all other events of the particular application.</seg>
<seg id="2720">The Event All Notifications for Application Standard (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. for this, you can set the notifications as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to save the settings for the notifications to a file. use the button reload to load saved settings from a file. if you want to start with an empty list, click Delete. all entries except All notifications will be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to highlight text for voice output. this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices, speech speed, loudness, gender of voice and pitch. SSML is a part of VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktops; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (british male) since this is the default voice used in the edition of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival Configuration dialog are not set to 100nbsp;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and statute limit filters (SDB filter). SBDs subdivide text into individual sets. thus, you can also start using the first set of synthesized orders, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the statute limit filter. at the first start of & ktops, a statute limit filter will be automatically set up. you can change its settings or add additional set limit filters, but beginners will be advised.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The simplest way to learn how to set up the language selection by trying out. switch off the selection selection and select text to read. switch off the selection selection, change some features and check how the choice of the speaker changed. of course, you need to have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can stop or cancel orders on the map card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal statute limit filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, just removed. change nothing at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limits recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tabulator sign (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tablature characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the default set limit filter keeps the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -Messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you removed from view the normal statute limit filter, you can insert it once again by downloading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktops.</seg>

<seg id="2737">Use of the Standard Speaker (the top on the card holder). in other words, no speaker characteristics are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate subscriber, who has all the features of a dedicated subscriber. if you do not delete or edit the subscriber's settings, select & ktops; otherwise select & ktops; the speaker, who is most likely to match the original features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker. if this feature does not matter, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Highlight this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this property. the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is ahead if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To delete all the features in the range of speakers most likely to be deleted, click on the default speaker selection button and then use speaker that matches the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (no order number is the input 0 required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I compiled debug support, but I don't get trace tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer has crashed and shut down. probably you need to record GStreamer. if the problem is not resolved by this, you may have a non-compatible version of GStreamer installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">Audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application. if I get a text order, freeze & ktops; one. on the & Console; appears a message that says: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system there is the problem that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I have installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / vocals, add the new voice. as a guide you can serve the other entries. if this is successful, please send a patch together with the & URL where you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the map audio there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program has to be installed sox and searchable via the PATH environment variable. some synthesizermodules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the map of the speaker system. depending on the selected voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speaking speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML. SSML has its own tags with which the speed is controlled.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; (see) or, if you are quite bold, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML deformation filter, and set up the speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make it happen that websites are read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktops; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">With Festival 1.95 beta, the day SABLE GENDER does not seem to work. thus, this festival does not produce errors, the xsl file causes converting from SSML to Saber the GENDER tags. the same also applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own drawing utensil filter and now I can go in & ktops; no longer set forth or go back. on the carton's orders it is shown, the order consists only from one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon) you are not allowed to filter out. use a filter for character recognition instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or newer. note: make sure the GStreamer modules are registered by using GStreamer in & ktt. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in audio output. if your system also counts, you can't play music at the same time and read a text. & ktops; freeze if you stop a text order and then start another. you can find possible solutions for this problem on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support any real breaks. if you stop a text order in & ktops, the current set will be read even more.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general setting of the speaking speed, but otherwise not mandatory. Debian users can install sox with the command apt-get install sox. the program is already included on most & Linux; -CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">If you have downloaded & ktops; downloaded as a tarball (with tar packaged archive), login as a normal user and unzip the tarball into a suitable folder. change to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 the module & arts; probably removed or at least only created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a runtime dependency of non-freer software.

<seg id="2768">Before you use & ktops, check first if your voice synthesizer is working properly. follow the instructions you have received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizer whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and there are multiple voices and languages supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival. if you want to read pages, you must install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you have to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. unzip the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you have to enter the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding such as KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux; distributions. try the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech language, the option code must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to 8-bit Cyrillic such as KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the MBROLA; synthesizer. then festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; this creates audio output. the & MBROLA; -program and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; not a complete language output system. & MBROLA; generates language from Diphone files. you need additional software to create this Diphone. Festival creates this Diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2778">With this procedure, additional wrapper code is added to the festival to use & MBROLA; -voices to voice synthesis. note that the & MBROLA; voice files are not installed in the & MBROLA; folders, but in the folder festival / lib /. instructions can be found under</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user to perform the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; displays network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network settings in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot be installed. physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured so that & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and the setting of the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be charged by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this will automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which best corresponds to the distribution and the rele balance. by marking the setting of non-recurring questions, the fixing can be made permanently. at the next start of the network settings, then this selection will be automatically preset.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system administration mode. before, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, the change is not possible. in system administration mode, you will be prompted by clicking the button System Management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to input the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system administration mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three categories:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed on the network can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... setup in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking the button's Advanced Settings displays the dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings are made for the system at the same time with the start of system services. the DHCP- or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the drop-down list you can select either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection Manuell, the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the field of netmask the subnet mask is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface at boot. if initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can determine if the address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched on if required. switch off a switched network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched on as needed. switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the machine's IP address in the local subnet that conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain address by the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host is calling http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will resolve this name to an IP address, such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator part of the Reiters naming solution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or altered. entries can be sorted by selecting a single entry and up or downgrading in the list with the buttons down or down in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group machine to the naming solution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button....</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list name known calculator describes the name-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used in the boot when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list of particular well-known hosts contains some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this will still be replaced in the test version of IP in future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add.... The New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known calculator and click the Add button. if the well-known calculator has several alias names, press the Add multiple times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a particular known calculator from the list and select Edit.... The dialog known machine will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings in the network settings are not effective immediately in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf.conf is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient to install & chede; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; install the rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphical surface like kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should make this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second section all of & knetworkconf; variable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found big dissemination. IPv6 is expected to enforce it in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address of a network interface is to assign. in foreign networks, on & eg; Workplace is the network administrator to assign a valid IP address, or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route that branches the loopback address (localhost = your own host).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section are the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections so it won't be surprised if there is another content in the case of active DSL connections as specified there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, it is known that this file is randomly sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which moreover offered the ability of dds2tar to fast, selective packaging. the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take when you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be bound by & kdat; this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; back the band back and read the band's pre-tensioning information. detects & dat; don't recognize the band; you'll be asked if the band is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & dat; the prefix, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched for the tape by opening the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the belt, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; there is a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be discarded without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a group of & kdat can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not conform to formatting at & kdat; if your tape drive needs to be formatted before use, this will happen before you can be formatted by the tape by & kdat; Floppy tape drives usually require formatting of the tape, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity goes & kdat; with the formatting of the band away. all data on the tape will be lost! after completing the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog opens up settings for backup. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings, the dialog will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu item DUT....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the checkout is started, the dialog will display settings for checking. in this dialog, you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for the check.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the check, the dialog will be overlooked. this dialog shows the progress of the review process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can reconnect, the files that are to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the Restore menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has started, the dialog will appear for recovery. in this dialog, you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for recovery, dialogue will restore. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to rebuild the band index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can rebuild the index to two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, only the files currently in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder. folders that are on other file systems, you can separately add them to backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the tar call. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; lt; and lt; lt; files have not yet been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up using the KDat menu item... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-winding variant of the tape machine.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Is this setting active, transmitted & dat; before the tape is bound, the command mt load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kills; to lock the ejection of the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when releasing a & kdat file, the tape will be ejected automatically. do not use this option in floppy stream.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; the hardwary block size can be changed for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need to communicate the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where the name of the system is the full name of the system on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that has passed since the era in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen shots, & ksystemlog; functions available, with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, try to open the system log; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - is not shown to you, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely not run with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log, for normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also filter the filtering toolbar to filter according to a selected criterion or after input string. the list of the log lines is now automatically changed, so that only logfiles will be displayed. in the default setting, the drop-down box contains the entry all. then, a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the selected column. for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the column process, and then, in the filter bar, select the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a more conspicuous color as protocol-lines of the level indicator. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain process (for example, in the system protocol, or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identifier (PID) in the column process. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can switch to new lines in the main window context menu in order to display all new addition protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.de. dort you will find further information about the Sources of & ksystemlog.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and named as named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">System V Init is rapidly becoming a standard for the control of program startup at the startup of the system in the & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go on to historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could attempt to switch a machine to System V Init without installing a new installation and reformat. therefore, you must ensure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">SysV Init differs from the BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc, instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to start when running the system or switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is started only once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">The rc.local should be on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something on startup, which has to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks in different places after the program init and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning, you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this then you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. be very careful when you have done something, then get it repaired by restarting the system and running the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from manually on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K contains, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server run level running only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position).</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new area. to just copy them to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The Sortiernummer of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the Sortiernummers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to reproduce entries thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the different workspaces (Verf√ºgbare Systemdienste, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it into the clipboard using cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it in the required runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the input button to change the Properties dialog. use the tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they are restored by & ksysv; changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine is constantly reopening. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">In the LILO prompt, type linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution at Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE, or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services in these distributions are started simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setting programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to a standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) just quit without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & cuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & cuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter customization of & cuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After making changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& cuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space restrictions (Quota) for users, a map card will be created on which you can make individual settings. additional map cards appear, if shadow passwords, or for example, / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card-card password management appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if for at least a built-in file system space constraint (Quota) is activated and initialized (identifiable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the space restrictions are given in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected using the field file system with space constraint.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The group map groups informs about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group Dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click on the matching tool bar button. editing or deleting the selected user or group functions analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO BootManager, remove and change the boot password, remove and change the time until the boot of the standard operating system, remove, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
