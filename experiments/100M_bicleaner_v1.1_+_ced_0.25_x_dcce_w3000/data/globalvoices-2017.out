although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became mainly a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Brief , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspi@@ racy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free from Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admi@@ ration for the US had only intensi@@ fied .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very dirty love letter about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never thinks behind the mountain as he says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague expresses it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won in the Repub@@ lican elections was the highest number that a candidate nomin@@ ally nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I could not harmon@@ ise Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that takes people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ umps of the world@@ view also agreed not with the present editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the present editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns . &quot;
the int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr who strug@@ gled for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
while Tr@@ ump made his way to the nominal repub@@ lican presidential candidate , they offered me a hold and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , gave the pres@@ idency a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump because they shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to call the tr@@ ump voters as raci@@ sts .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act and think differently in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
could it be that these voters , most of whom know , voted for tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to rise up a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( note : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; word game from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , as the great Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has done so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America is always welcome .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
but with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps there is a huge part of the White Americas on this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm , they say .
in all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who died in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of wording with the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a seat in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a seat in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; by Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what is the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ ag@@ ua@@ an city of Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
that the music played in both places , not only has changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the apost@@ asy
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the congregation of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence .
however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and gave the youth a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their commitments vis @-@ à @-@ vis the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to meet their great passion .
they are always laugh@@ ing and playing with shiny eyes , playing trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , wood@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , b@@ ong@@ os and the con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village located practically on top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments produced from recycled material :
music with revi@@ ved instruments made up of local solid waste materials made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers have started turning parts of the waste into instruments under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez .
the instruments mim@@ ic violin , viola , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , saxophone , trumpet , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were made of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra and so on .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , rec@@ alls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the gar@@ bage The kids did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin made of tr@@ ash .
today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments from recycled material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of tr@@ ash every year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring drama from rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project fighting wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication is done as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were thus up@@ set and little inclined to welcome a criminal off@@ ender of this type on their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles mobili@@ zed fast against the ship . they refused to attack one of their har@@ bours and refused to grant him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that simply denied anything &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ y authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship at his time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : he was not able to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to lo@@ oting of the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative that crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fisher@@ y ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries , which at that time evi@@ cted the premi@@ er from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal F@@ ishing . this project offers FISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is tra@@ pped is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , tra@@ ce@@ able on FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries , for example , exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i also atten@@ ds the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark ships fishing in prohibited areas . also , such susp@@ icious routes can be discovered - such as suggest that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license , where they were on the road and possibly also if they have a blast furn@@ ace .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then deny the acceptance of such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information . what does the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it comes to substantial financial losses for the owner , meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , head director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the so @-@ called platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which lost the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of the illegal fishermen who enter East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . among these are also those illegal fishermen .
their practices include , among other things , actions like sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licence papers , stat@@ ing of fant@@ asi@@ es , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ brid@@ led control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You may not run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close FISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has un@@ covered criminal networks that had distributed counter@@ f@@ eit lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for the fight against crime , FISH @-@ i may share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system capable of helping FISH @-@ i to detect susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at try@@ gg M@@ at Tra@@ cking , an NGO which also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers FISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , for example , with which they can no longer be ge@@ ared by satell@@ ites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that combines different levels of information . it is designed to help FISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ alizing ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can FISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global F@@ ishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine protection organisation : a platform that offers satellite data and by which the position of every single tra@@ ce@@ able ship can be displayed throughout the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; gather together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what they do - that &apos;s just sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and join their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project to run in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect crimin@@ als , but also deter them .
ships that had been f@@ ished without a license and hardly had to face any consequences now know that they are being monitored .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in FISH @-@ i have meanwhile become a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after which FISH @-@ i Somalia had helped det@@ ecting Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found Schle@@ pp@@ netz@@ e on board , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of FISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars will disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 six countries joined together to form the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also combat illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as FISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , FISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only was the ship on the way without a license and used to@@ wing nets that are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for FISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans is actually working throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . she writes on the subject environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in the red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela goes further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; going back the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
this image by María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the Venezu@@ el@@ an government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emp@@ tin@@ ess by meeting on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the reco@@ il of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the territory of the country of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the centre of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteri@@ or@@ ating , which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the Opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro ; ultimately , the dep@@ ortation of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Marianne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the governmental decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum applied for many as the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the elec@@ toral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or a short MU@@ D ( for example : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , the demonstr@@ ators gathered to support the National Assembly on October 27 , as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government headquarters , on November 3 , the blocking of the referendum would continue to exist .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nation@@ wide civil war and on 3 November all to Car@@ acas to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Return of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confront@@ ations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator who calls through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , pictures that tell about confront@@ ations , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
particularly large waves hit the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local Cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not carry skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many National Guard did not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round , which forms the amount of supp@@ ression a day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for a counter@@ part proceedings - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news page .
the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cordoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said to his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept family secrets .
in the situation at that time , I thought that it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ ur@@ ers and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano , was a senior officer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the Intelligence Department , 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who testi@@ fied against a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose for himself a way of rede@@ mption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everyone called it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and urged me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you made yourself friends with one of the ERP systems .
don &apos;t just say that she will not kid@@ n@@ ap you one day and I have to save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers &apos; Party of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the base of the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ There will be tor@@ tured the prisoners &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack where cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little bag wrapped up in a blank@@ et and told me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I went in and saw a couch that people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field bed and metal feathers .
later I found out that they put an end to a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person standing there .
they seldom tied up a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and h@@ unted him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ it@@ als .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty win@@ dle .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another person ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - to the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were blin@@ ded .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face - all were tied on hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoner , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you see , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I rep@@ lied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told us at home .
besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the testimony of survivors of the civil war Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way the kid@@ n@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be rel@@ oc@@ ated .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; back then at age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war spo@@ ils &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as they called - was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was in the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military bad@@ ges that one takes off an enemy that has been fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then that is not war @-@ mare but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join with this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to penet@@ rate into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminal and I rep@@ lied : and you who st@@ ole cars on the street ?
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and destroy you .
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do this !
that &apos;s how my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a sco@@ op pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought home clothes .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ er in this crime . I resist@@ ed , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted .
I was there anyway in order to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the last hein@@ ous act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , where I am older , I feel regre@@ ts .
I have children . once you have children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life .
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship . but why would the bodies disappear ?
why kid@@ n@@ apped children ?
one day my father brought a girl with him home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why would their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families with whom one could commit their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the last hein@@ ous act that man can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was re @-@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were cr@@ ushed and disp@@ osed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the idea of displaying my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have no one killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt internally dis@@ cour@@ aged and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; they allegedly def@@ ended were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only rep@@ lied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , don &apos;t show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I checked the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can blame me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally spoken against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
he was charged for 4@@ 16 crimes : severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases of severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases , and a case of kid@@ n@@ apping of one under 10 years of age .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnit@@ ude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims , finally in August .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 def@@ endants were killed during the trial .

all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kid@@ n@@ apped with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years for justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organisation , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country to La Per@@ la , so that there could be a memorial erected by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ky@@ oto . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Ky@@ oto , where you can extend your driving license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town of Ky@@ oto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving license , witnessed a very un@@ successful translation last month .
on a sign the Japanese word ( kor@@ ei@@ dop@@ a ) , which means &quot; older motor@@ ists , &quot; was wron@@ g@@ ly translated - perhaps also with bad rear @-@ thanks &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; aw@@ ful drivers . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ oto . he was also who drew attention to the local newspapers .
Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n &apos;s appearing in Ky@@ oto wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Ky@@ oto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the name of the en@@ vo@@ c drivers was later replaced by the appropriate , al@@ beit gramm@@ atically not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Ky@@ oto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received by the translator , and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published .
blog@@ gers made just r@@ right content as you did , the we@@ eb will be much more useful than ever before . &#124;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast news was a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ oun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older motor@@ ists who are involved nation@@ ally in accidents is quite a reason to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Ky@@ oto , for example , 1,9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19,@@ 460 deaths from sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of altogether 11,@@ 850 accidents .
thus their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors increased in the same period .
the particularly un@@ named rep@@ orter brought comments to the light on Yahoo &apos;s published version of the article , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese war@@ ns against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo over the translation error received among other things the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So er@@ ron@@ eous the translation is actually not at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo by Fli@@ ckr user Andrew .
the reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , one needs two important abilities : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that trans@@ lators in the target language should not be in the source language - native speakers .
for example , French native speakers should translate from English into French - not translated into English by French .
photo by Fli@@ ckr user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language who could translate translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , make translations still in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to be a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ckr user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the s@@ worn and en@@ ig@@ matic sets that are created by machine translation show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages quite special .
some of the stran@@ gest English expressions in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often decor@@ ate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ckr user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harm@@ less as jewelry . but from large companies or government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Ky@@ oto hopefully uses a more serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ors on the Internet and television
main@@ page of the Port@@ als &quot; nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online transmitter .
other users later wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible .
other online channels contributed to the recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , which the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government resist@@ ed .
the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the duties of parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was c@@ apped , and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ orship : enables your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net page .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media has been rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they would continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as a call for violence .
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is astonishing that it is still cheaper to buy two litre of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible due to a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique whereby the DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server replies faul@@ ty or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third se@@ per@@ ated channel , the broadcast was suspended on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ eram@@ an El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ acas live , was taken into cust@@ ody .
Flor@@ es was struck while he was in cust@@ ody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on mission again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : thus , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans are becoming increasingly difficult to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country .
in Paraguay , a lot of girls are slaves to receive education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
today , Tina fights for the rights of children and colle@@ cts testimon@@ ies from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who became the victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use with kind permission of structural .
the following article is the short@@ ened version of a structural , published by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house proudly said about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay the more than 46,@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is simple : a large family with little money transfers their min@@ ors @-@ year @-@ old son or her minor @-@ year @-@ old daughter to another , more ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child gets food , training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children must pay inn@@ um@@ erable days of house@@ work that will never be paid and will be victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of an agreement that cannot be lifted .
the practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testimon@@ ies , resear@@ ched and den@@ oun@@ ced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated with the Cri@@ adi@@ tas guarantees generally still silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , the family that her daughter believes in the belief that she is leaving her education , improving her position in society and &quot; making something out of it &quot; can be handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes care of the girl and justi@@ fies their exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive education and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl gets mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hiding place in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of heavy blo@@ ws . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military unit Tom@@ ás Fer@@ reira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ reira hit a stick on Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela , deeply held in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Society , were responsible for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people gathered to protest documents and demanded that there should be &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , more cows than children are registered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers it is much easier to un@@ punished the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid investigation into the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ reira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their cri@@ adi@@ ta to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be pointing out - if the case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court for the first time in the history of Paraguay .
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to register and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to go all work and began selling cand@@ y on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( # 1.01 Pilot ) ( TV )
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days for instance , she cleaned the fridge , so@@ iled the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner it was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but this time too was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also did not have unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
some evenings forced the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sender@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but didn &apos;t entert@@ ain her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they think that I would &quot; learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there again , &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who is part of the indigenous group of the Guar@@ an@@ í , would speak at home again their mother tongue guar@@ an@@ í .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed to lose , they explained .
but she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work .
also at school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken is mo@@ b@@ bing and the sham@@ ans who are exposed to cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to go home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belong to no group .
isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Society appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which you can share job ads for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the group administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ anov@@ sky , a coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón District .
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please report to you .
start from Monday if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven year old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the country &apos;s interior who wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the survey turned into the display once again :
dear girl@@ friends , I found one . I see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the Cri@@ adi@@ tas report , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testimon@@ ies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , cu@@ ñ@@ adi@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , who were ens@@ lav@@ ed by the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors in Paraguay and the indigenous population , went into a system of slavery , where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the display of power is the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
draft law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ ating the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is accepted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would be set up to use citizens to use a permit to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could take a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fine .
the draft bill consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cens@@ ored in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as &quot; any application that is running and used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video viewer and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , since the draft is not a reference to how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration . it is un@@ clear how they should make up for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and sponsors of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and received a username and password from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fire@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which blocks Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to er@@ ect a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but so far it has not been known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in English &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that the same way they could control the physical public and private spaces as they could be done online .
if I take them seriously , this means they will establish a strong monitoring system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a trial .
this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legisl@@ ature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plen@@ ary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and asser@@ tion will succeed or not , the design &quot; is in accordance with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in the Parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no dis@@ sent@@ ing nar@@ ration is present on the image , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy was propos@@ ing a bill of law against cy@@ ber crime in which a life imprisonment for those who were found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest against protest . &quot;

this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions .
high up in the Kur@@ dist@@ an mountains in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activists H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the ghost le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which is fought through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conserv@@ ation of Nature .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the Persian le@@ op@@ ard the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem depends on the fact that a big pre@@ dat@@ or exists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passi@@ on@@ ately demonstrates a different side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict .
it has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

in early March 2017 , the conservative daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , has been making progress that has been hit in the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; in March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom bomb in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was an unusual pre@@ f@@ ect in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate because the ts@@ un@@ ami had all coastal towns to disappear from the map .
in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced a nuclear accident , already on the other hand , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from the local point of view , which progress has been reached six years later in order to re@@ build the life of the local residents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the detailed report of the newspaper covers statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those affected by themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures saw Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent is the final light .
at the same time , even six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated by in@@ struc@@ tional shel@@ ters ( tent@@ atively after@@ no@@ ons , kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) are converted into final spare @-@ houses .
after the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in this case . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated patients were res@@ ett@@ led to final homes after the disaster .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
like the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 1,0@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are back in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have res@@ um@@ ed their operation at Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have largely affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agriculture .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land used in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far down@@ cast .
the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is up to 90 percent on the same level as before the accident . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only be 75 percent .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine a total image , the newspaper led numerous surveys among the local population and the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she ques@@ tioned her about the state of reconstruction and also how her emp@@ athy has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
as it is about those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience .
of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were rel@@ oc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23,@@ 000 people res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent surro@@ unds .
after the 2017 stand there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated patients who still live in accommodation establishments are older than 50 years old . they need to be rec@@ alled in correct homes because efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if you encounter people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be bigger at first than the simil@@ arities .
however , after a while , one often recogni@@ zes that a more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global links are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , extend our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we are looking at exactly these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we handle issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ita explains how the love of music re@@ members the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and now placed him in an artificial coma .
his condition is considered cri@@ tically .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also to recognize the face of the police officer who attacked a stroke . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the end of the examination of the incident by the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officers , as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his head@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer det@@ ects from a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive station , his face would be visible for six months on television and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ kt@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Luz , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several medi@@ cs shortly hur@@ ry to him .
another video with the same scenes , but fil@@ med from a different perspective , is also di@@ pped in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans rel@@ ays ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has been shared several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish has been killed by his father because he has joined the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here was the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group , and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva who has been attacked by a police officer who struck him with a stroke .
police attacked by police
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only country in Brazil , where last Friday was a brutal police raid against prot@@ esters .
polic@@ emen were in protest at the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber floors and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the social and peace party ( P@@ SOL ) , asked the police to reno@@ un@@ ce violence against prot@@ esters .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media has conce@@ aled street protests by ste@@ aling the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window window .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were targeted by a broken glass window to portra@@ y their cover pages in an illu@@ stra@@ tive way with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a specific cause .
this must also be recognized if one is strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a absurd , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence by the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Demon@@ stran@@ ts on confrontation with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages forgotten by the de@@ indu@@ ction in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories joined the doors in Cuba ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as El Central - on the Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after flying , the sugar cane industry was still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ old of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves ane@@ w .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories , which still ground .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry doesn &apos;t ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are back in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene reminds itself exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ alen I would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 @-@ produced quantity .
the news would have been a motive for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not a new thing anymore .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old rail platform of the community already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose from about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os must remain per pound according to the report published by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Economic and Nutrition Organization .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate circa 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly enter history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on began the process of restructuring in the sugar industry .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories arrived , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene , as known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word he is most repeated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all sur@@ vey@@ ed were in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents that would be distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , addressing the addres@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was over@@ crowded and the letters were becoming more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the commissioned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace generator has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services that generated the facilities in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the present persons when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things changed , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to disman@@ tle them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ e the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to pick up other factories .
they were to spare parts .

first Nations you@@ ths use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture

young people from the First Nations communities throughout Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do this by hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , mobile recording studios have been leading directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Gruppe The North@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop thus increases that the young participants in discussions like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tri@@ bal of the Kit@@ sw@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a road section in West Can@@ ada , where almost two dozen usually indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
most of the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influence of glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the you@@ ths are not always able to speak the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ star hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a stop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an there is a tran@@ script available , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
that is the day when you will consume our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and continue our youth as well
so they can do what it determines the Creator

plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant in Japan
plastic dishes ( car@@ pet@@ ual not@@ ches ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , near the entrance of sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( pet@@ als , &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; ) are issued by every dish that is served in this restaurant .
the customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ cker district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders has documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so custom@@ ary that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend now turns them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
Na@@ ver Mat@@ oma published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in the special sale : new mobile ri@@ bb@@ ons decorated with plastic dishes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collec@@ ti@@ bles as in this case , refrigerator mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refrigerator mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in Tokyo station .
the new boom in food percep@@ tions is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for mobile , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ical .
some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case IK@@ UR@@ A or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anybody who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise your colleagues or family members uncomfortable .
our latest mobile phone support has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # car@@ ving posts # to the shelf .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which de@@ votes itself to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports in- and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with itself .
the report on drug bos@@ ses , such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with pain .
there are behind any cor@@ pse , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret gra@@ ves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) that will give these victims a voice and tell stories about people who were in the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear changed life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret gra@@ ves for his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves to seek and to seek gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
you are entitled to the assurance of my father , but it does not get paid off , because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ render a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been acquainted with illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come across a newspaper ki@@ osk every day and see the cover pages with pictures that can only origin@@ ate from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files from specialists .
it brings me out of version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
it continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ cker ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness , when stories become mere numbers in a statistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students will be justified in a neigh@@ bor village that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to persu@@ ade them to be spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and quiet .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district , &quot; as a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed by threats . &quot; it describes how an armed criminal had spent money from their business month for month , until they had destroyed not only the business but also torn apart their family .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain in this never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested because you don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ n@@ ap or kill you .
I wonder@@ ed in these terrible days if we@@ eping would dis@@ solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with pain .
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , fry potatoes , warm tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , who saw bloody cra@@ w@@ ls of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez mixed .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Prosec@@ ution was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8,5 kill@@ ings per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ckr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which he links contain pictures where violence is represented .
the Fak@@ ten@@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared the first time ? content in social media , whether true or unt@@ rue , tends to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to commit trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tank wagon crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
trag@@ ically , it fell victim to the tan@@ ker .
government representatives described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a movie in the vicinity , which was full of people watching the football World Cup .
houses burned and wi@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
a picture titled &quot; Das ist Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are str@@ ung on the ground while people are watching them .
but the story does not end here .
over the years the same photograph was resear@@ ched several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , and wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to real , but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and b@@ ushes .
reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were sh@@ attered , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between military Nigeria and the attempt by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was mistakenly shown to be evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
08.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Des@@ perate Housewives
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented con@@ jun@@ ctions to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings .
one step further brings personal comments like this , for example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a bl@@ itz announcement , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee stro@@ kes , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported on the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture origin@@ ates from an Saudi Arabian news page that fal@@ sely claimed President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians had taken part in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to instru@@ ct this information .
the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source were also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein Being this statement , but had not been associated with the image of the DR Congo .
the global reach of false data
traces of these false cou@@ p@@ ies extend back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information borders can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 images that are very similar to the said image of DR Congo .
they origin@@ ate from a mixer collection of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , some others have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have limited examples of ab@@ usive use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of what they have been published on which side they have been published . thereby , we want to represent the reach more clearly than by the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which have been linked together in some cases ) several examples of ab@@ usive use can be found .
here are some cases , which can now be completely scrat@@ ched ( on the map in orange ) :

the orange @-@ colored countries are still available on sites or servers , over the examples of counter@@ fei@@ ting or false reports are still available .

this post , addressed to the members of the Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .

this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar has admitted being in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image .

after written a message , supp@@ os@@ edly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false .
from the emb@@ assy in which the image was taken from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ates and sides in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) Tin@@ Eye also indicates , but are no longer fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image ultimately bears a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used with regard to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is important . therefore , it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer believe these images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are sixty people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suggests this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are unt@@ rue and nar@@ row@@ ly the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that rej@@ ecting images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images readers and viewers des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , which investigated how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to be discussed regarding violent depic@@ tions in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against fake news . they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used in context or entirely ab@@ usive .
however , each examination of false write @-@ ups should also take into account how internationally they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
Foto@@ album Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 License .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. insur@@ mount@@ able ) tries to provide language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
such words exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist ten@@ acious every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression does not suff@@ ice , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find , for example , words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Rem@@ ember your parents in recognition of how you have tried in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the comfort or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after having heated up in the sun on cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Birds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they dis@@ gr@@ ind other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you can influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which are highly valued by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite songs here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ds and floo@@ ds in this decade .
caused by the mon@@ soon that normally ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ ten@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to a opinion of the disaster center of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people were missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud baths .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 health resorts .
the ra@@ inf@@ alls were closed on Saturday ( May 27th ) , and the floo@@ ds in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene items represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ds in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates for flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly ri@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after more ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on their way .
today tomorrow the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was in the floo@@ ds , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded due to the water peg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and other five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants that are floo@@ ded in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian help .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ile is informed .
last year after the Ro@@ an@@ u Trop@@ ical Storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for the pick @-@ up of assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded free of charge to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ds and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , residents in need provide security and assistance .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now approaching the long road to the restoration of norm@@ ality .
the Muslims that cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March will be held in San Francisco on January 21st 2017 .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I trust her my four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the br@@ anding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next we call for rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the icon@@ ic picture of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ il@@ ding slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already guided this conversation .
people with whom I have been working or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their conception .
they kid@@ n@@ ap me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we prac@@ tise our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit into it , are un@@ mus@@ li@@ zed .
un@@ mus@@ li@@ zed to be un@@ mus@@ li@@ zed

this is even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come to mind when you think of him ?
to be in love ?
to be in peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western conception the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the re@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid sm@@ ashed the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures also rise further today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ al them .
I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty nar@@ ra@@ tives domin@@ ate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this Nar@@ ra@@ ctive fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forced Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ ra@@ tic weak@@ ens Muslim women , who lead the movements for change .
it sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this narrative has made our collective imagination so deep and er@@ ron@@ eous that often Sik@@ h men and children become the goal of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and delic@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we are doing more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ ra@@ tives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the nar@@ ra@@ tives of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims account in the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious groups in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ Russians .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation coming from 77 countries .
the author &apos;s parents were in New York in 1976 .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ignor@@ ant of Muslims and Americans .
but am I now ignor@@ ant Muslim and American ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork meat , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ ful pocket that all Muslims carry with - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ ay , we do not wear all pocket @-@ be@@ eh@@ i@@ vers with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological expert to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of prominent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ air , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in more than just a foreig@@ ner who out@@ lines a woman the head@@ sc@@ arf .
or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the USA , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its most ug@@ ly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .

use approved .
I want to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but being a Muslim first was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : belief , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim belief and behavior are not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girl@@ friend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the br@@ anding that I am Muslim if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ritual with my daughter if I kept her in my arms , and whis@@ per her Arab verses to protect the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim community is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi with her sisters at some point in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging is the image of my mat@@ ernal grand@@ mother with her sisters , as she decades ago win a contest of the art of the flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
it is the image of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by her perf@@ ected and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
being Muslim means to speak the prayers they told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people , which - over centuries - was colon@@ ised by an &quot; Empire &quot; which a company established with the name of Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dia Company , it has a profound meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grand@@ father .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grand@@ father we@@ eps .
in between , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an we@@ pt for his family in India , with K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he could not close to his arms in half a century .
belonging to this is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grand@@ father , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first fli@@ p@@ book of history was rejected by a Muslim country before a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir under@@ tan of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous history .
it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent , apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy is home to the US and the susp@@ ect bears a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination .
it means knowing that four@@ teen hundred years ago the first prayer call , called Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a fre@@ ed black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to this land .
it means nam@@ ing Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim , and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties , with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but fail to communicate it to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the nar@@ ra@@ tives of the 1.7 billion bir@@ ch more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced doubt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim regions who began with President Bush and were wi@@ dened under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration officer who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders against people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ List &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that largely addresses Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we lead and the bombs we throw in Muslim lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those who we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study titled Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University showed a scienti@@ fically correct picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims got the sli@@ ghtest number of points .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we must lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply concerned to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are standing back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous expression we have in our news editor .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our many times with binding identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Sea Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sh@@ ap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ KI@@ STAN@@ IA , Muslim , American super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I &apos;m concerned about this difficult global time in which we are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not yet given it ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story that I wasn &apos;t aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who made me an unknown Muslim today .
things I have left here like a bread crum@@ b in my speech .
things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity makes , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Ber@@ kel@@ ey , con@@ vers@@ ations will take place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred acade@@ mics speak about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not concepts with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being fought and people were enth@@ ron@@ ed by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , four decades ago was itself a scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions according to the role of being aware and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; ; just as my girl@@ friend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he has already been bombar@@ ded by other people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban speech diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ckr user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to contact someone in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ mount@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land , in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not very small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening frequently is connected with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events are rather &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to make sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers present their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devot@@ ion and their depic@@ tion lead to the fact that the audience insi@@ sts .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history from Burkina Faso that is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the traditions typical for their country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ abel of the rab@@ bit and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the importance of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his feeling of intim@@ acy :
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . anyone who is inspired by the project can get in touch with T@@ LS to organize their own story @-@ telling performances .
Puerto Rico calls for re@@ establishment of state debt by the United States
with the goal of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 . the march started at the Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano Civil Front ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical assembly of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ establishment of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico call for politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials who are responsible for debts to be held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interest in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding re@@ mun@@ eration , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refused to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be reconc@@ iled to decl@@ ining retirement payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the territory of the United States - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy &quot; suggests a non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law of responsibility for government , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico calls for a broad restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measures imposed on the outside will be dangerous without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration called the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nach@@ tw@@ ache für Licht und Wahrheit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture hosted in Berlin , an event devoted to the # Free@@ Pool campaign was dedicated .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara Rü@@ hl@@ ing , managing director of book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; book spr@@ ints &apos; books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of ess@@ ays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what is the real cost to which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and writers who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news feeds and to create something meaningful out of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free b@@ ass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and ac@@ claimed Internet volunteers who have been imprison@@ ed in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introdu@@ ctory part of his book entitled Colle@@ ctive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bass@@ el is paying a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us begin thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the cust@@ ody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted by people who pret@@ ended to be insi@@ ders of Assad &apos;s government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
but its place of residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of creative comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Thre@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that Bass@@ el founded , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ tille &apos;s cultural prot@@ otypes was more pro@@ voc@@ ative than the work that he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arch@@ e@@ ological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything about it , this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage Sys@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strike in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el had not yet completed this project .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life surrounded by freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in cust@@ ody .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked him . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a pro@@ dig@@ al that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in cust@@ ody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for one year .
they sm@@ ug@@ gled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English .
the book is freely available .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is happening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your lovely eyes ,
that I lose the contempl@@ ation in the moment we embrace ,
that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guards
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words .
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote :
a year passes , my soul
during the day
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ tille &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we repeat today our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambique : due to corruption sentenced director after release again on previous post
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to work at the state apparatus at which corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants , together with four other def@@ endants .
the money came from the public funds of the Air@@ ports of Moz@@ ambique , whose advice was Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good lead and immediately called for his re @-@ setting to the company , which happened on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which issued the motion , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ b@@ aza , to refer back to his old post , as the company did not perform disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish its director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustr@@ ates the lack of transparency and is even a step back@@ wards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary procedure against the conf@@ lic@@ ting one .
however , the company seems to be silent and does not cause any reasonable legal action to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ war@@ dly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which he had eaten .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating spe@@ eches , he could advise and polish the image .
but since he is in@@ competent he has cons@@ ented to become re@@ integrated into the company he helped to cause damage .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly be paid for his silence .
re@@ fut@@ able !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director is no moral :
Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ b@@ aza ple@@ ases to return mor@@ ality and to serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served herself by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as hand@@ ele it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself is we@@ ary of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind us that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves are part of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison and will not only remember the Moz@@ amb@@ ans for ever as the first independent president , but also as a keen , tailor @-@ made and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , when he confirmed energe@@ tically that &quot; an ambitious man was capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also decl@@ ining :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison for 10 years and he was free .
and today the company , in which he de@@ frau@@ ds money , is again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ θ@@ ι@@ к за@@ ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ors many users wron@@ g@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or split @-@ b@@ asses . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar , the known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &quot; Kal@@ ar . &quot;
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ indi@@ an origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &apos; Indian &apos; .
Facebook acts as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely dimin@@ ishing con@@ not@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically provo@@ ke hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts , in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for their use , were cens@@ ored .
moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings , which have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ alter@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ itting A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a spiritual way whether they knew how he could alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the movement ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before releasing all posts that are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not manual . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on a fac@@ sim@@ ile .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words by side .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who distribute hate speech receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to cut off their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started del@@ eting his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished by the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; didn &apos;t match the Facebook community standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative purposes or who simply try to show their opinions on the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have more to do before the beginning of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they didn &apos;t try to correct the fake posts .
if they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , it would be great .
lap@@ tops automatic cens@@ orship has ensured a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now laugh about Facebook and deliberately write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the web .
here you can see some scre@@ enshots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech , but they were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to try out whether Facebook remo@@ ves the post that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also stimulate violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where confront@@ ations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to control the prolifer@@ ous hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sites .
but rather than simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look more in context than on code focusing initiatives and learned from them .
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is close to the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country adopted unanim@@ ously a law to ban this practice , so that the married age is now 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to this change of the husband , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities held in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not inter@@ fere , since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; not@@ with@@ standing the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contract partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors are defined as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married with 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical Central Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which were anxi@@ ous to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . no doubt they helped bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sort of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated thing , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was adopted against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to appro@@ ve and pro@@ claim the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave on Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle re@@ posted to Inst@@ agram :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for this and none .
having been decided previously in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were thr@@ illed , because the laws on pa@@ edi@@ at@@ rics have finally been changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk , which has conce@@ aled the core of the matter , but do you know what ? it &apos;s illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth every price .
while Abel Jackson used the opinion , it was definitely long enough to complete the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ o @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , great news !
the law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group who spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the marri@@ age@@ able age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on the amend@@ ment of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 dep@@ u@@ ties and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all members who were opposed to the law voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a long fight ( ... ) # shiel@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many thanks to all activists who have challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
but a possible catch comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most famous Hin@@ du organisation .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take court action , the law should be passed , and he seems to be able to rede@@ em his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris , Al ra@@ wi , advoc@@ ates a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of talking so in general , in a way that can only call panic and dis@@ grace if we , instead of speaking of the problem , would say that the state , our daughters from before , protects them from being ab@@ used by large , stub@@ born males who are opposed to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children &apos;s marriage is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that they prohi@@ bit .

after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains blocked , there are now several mirrors ( sites that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform cleared all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. host computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
despite legal prohibition , the content is also available .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the news ( about the block from Wikipedia ) , we put everything in mind to transfer snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was done independent of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about scre@@ enshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has brought both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirrors page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar man@@ irr@@ ors when blocked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ igra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Moz@@ illa at the Pan@@ igra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror .
one attacks another URL that is not the original . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server transfers the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for conservation .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poor@@ ly positioned moti@@ fs and washed colours .
this motivated him to wear a camera and try to bury the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj called me ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father , that on the shore of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the Leopard found himself and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal and want to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he had already faced Tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger cannot be bo@@ ther@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ cum@@ ber appeared . he immediately starts to see us and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent in order to take photographs of ad@@ ders at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist information .
take a look at some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , it is possible to avoid women with the utmost care to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that they respect the husband because of the social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , maintain this practice alive .
last year , mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian State O@@ dish@@ a was condemned by a false court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after having addressed a married family with names .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives as well is also common among men . however , they have far fewer rights to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and were thus quickly becoming the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is run by the community of video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices , such as children &apos;s marriage and dep@@ ortation of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected ones , and heads these clubs .
it tells how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of the change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in its panel discussion was women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands to speak lou@@ dly , is a custom that they all du@@ ti@@ fully maintain and never ques@@ tioned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini comments :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this panel discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband , wanted to try out at home how it works .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent until the video was finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini launched her first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then they all asked , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women could never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was only sitting in front of him , another decided to release the whole du@@ sty fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ aline rush to have broken with an age @-@ old custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands on behalf .
and they kept their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the foreh@@ ead that shows the sp@@ ell@@ atus :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
the other women did not fully belong to it , but they think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it in some days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip to every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to make sure who what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things about which they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to say things loud , no matter how small they happen to be .
in a panel discussion , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have only used sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ war cour@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they did not dare .
after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of his own choice of clothes , the mor@@ ality associated with the sar@@ is and much more , sm@@ ug@@ ged Roh@@ ini her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a panel discussion so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club has changed , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly rolling :
we have only taken small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then again they stopped saying the name of their husband .
some , including me , do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at any time on their foreh@@ ead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like taking part in more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ archy .
I am also there .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home in the club and telling other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all in the same boat .

the first Japan trip to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screenshot of the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be held on the h@@ ash@@ tag of the Yu@@ bei Twitter trend in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war era .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail trade , Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
today the Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day in Japan is today . they were here 51 years ago in Tokyo .
even today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Ged@@ en@@ kt@@ ag .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll is to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the well @-@ known places associated with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , that &apos;s your 5 places you absolutely must visit
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Ma@@ thew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( Vom Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Ged@@ en@@ kt@@ ag .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
and of course , some companies also use the fan community in terms of market technology , such as the R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is how the day is going .
so , we hope you are there !
next to the h@@ ash@@ tag , there will be more information about the Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day .
red @-@ headed men are displac@@ ed and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be in Moz@@ ambique target of attacks .

a new system of kid@@ n@@ apping glasses for organ traffi@@ cking , presum@@ ably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , concerns the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently , they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a cat @-@ headed man can bring gold or bring wealth , declared the BBC &apos;s spokes@@ person on the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with alco@@ hol@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 in South Africa conducted a mission to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , particularly in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be W@@ ey@@ a lives in the city of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique to travel gl@@ itter@@ ing men in Moz@@ ambique are the goal of ritual attacks , warned the mos@@ aic police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the city of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ane in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of temporary individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also ackno@@ wle@@ dges that a faith exists , according to which the victims were in the head of power , the riches .
in the last days three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ reira Sam@@ antha told on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blog &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Moz@@ ambique is facing :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE likes to go A Land in which people would have shame to go to the streets as if they would like to challenge sex with good notes , work and other achievements , a nation in which people would be ashamed to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are h@@ unted .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ ren humor were not to be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ers that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are bald .
Mos@@ ambi@@ an authorities are very worried about the kill@@ ings of gl@@ itter@@ ing people .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and all those who have known and loved him .
a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , active in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in expanding the public &apos;s access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices Community and participated in our meeting in Arabic in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ sel &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted by people who own himself as insi@@ ders of Assad &apos;s government .
they reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ sel &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we are hon@@ oring the glory of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of open web motion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we honor the efforts of all the people and organisations who have been campaig@@ ning for their release over the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the start of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , such as the organisation of Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those who were arrested by the regime or who disappeared viol@@ ently are torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in cust@@ ody , so the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprison@@ ed Chinese dis@@ sident , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( endanger@@ ment ) after he had taken part in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nonetheless , China still maintains calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him to be treated abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are fully wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure in order to allow li@@ u abroad a treatment .
Norway , Norway , Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Alan &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway fell into st@@ ump after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 2010 to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government informed that this ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations continued to res@@ ume in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the laugh@@ ing trip to China , as exports had largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was not able to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union , European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants .
the EU &apos;s top diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as she said in a statement on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should be able to meet and receive all visits that they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA , Canada , USA
U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as he could help him in his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ person on the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the message asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation of the US emb@@ assy attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere and make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ person Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was released on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had big concerns whether the vort@@ ex of Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada ( in english )
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China invited China to provide Li@@ u adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room at the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to talk and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um nar@@ rates on :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to uph@@ old and appro@@ ve the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;

France &apos;s State Department urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an Declaration on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family are to have contact with him .
although the news station France Info reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that no further information will be issued if France will eventually take up it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of land@@ lords in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progres@@ sive Party also urged China to allow the sick intellectu@@ ally li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama ( Dalai Lama )
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very worried in an explanation on June 28 about Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly punished , had led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore . Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem fool@@ ish as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Justice Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
it supports Singapore as a city should be considered .
... no one ques@@ tioned whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people get a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and efforts to create this valuable land , we can say that ultimately we are not a country .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in view of this , he seemed in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently guided by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once one reaches the core of the subject , the good old Lei@@ er comes again from the author@@ it@@ arian mach@@ inations that pret@@ end to be demo@@ crats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end , in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , the answers given to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were really no answers .
he clo@@ aked the corresponding questions with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our valued K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point as long as he was paid high to be part of the City of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out regarding the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the whole copy of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the sig@@ natur@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore is more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously does not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , which makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement as a leader of a growing generation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said about Singapore ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard that was waiting for me - whether I agree with them or not , but that is another matter .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review breaks down the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; credi@@ ble a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ ge spokes@@ man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
as it plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of grave importance .
why do the people of Singapore afford their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
whom does our Prime Minister need to pay the bills back ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade joins Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear testimon@@ ies such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defending the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . , but this is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screenshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuing series with rum@@ ours spread over certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest install@@ ment of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question I most asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
on my clari@@ fication most often follows the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook in@@ war@@ dly with anger when they are kept for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first of all , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you would change me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be idle - as the good @-@ nat@@ ured , soft , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harm@@ less means to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to make no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main characteristic of Canadi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what exterior standing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau then entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
Musik@@ video einer Pop @-@ Band par@@ odi@@ ert The Music of a Pop @-@ Band
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video , par@@ o@@ eing the Jun@@ ta , who took power in 2014 and despite their promise to restore the civilian government , the country continues to reign .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what rules his girl@@ friend makes .
although not explicitly political , the music video is indirectly related to the ongoing military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video loaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 254 times and got 8,@@ 800 likes .
last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in@@ particular as it relates to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has pursued in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adju@@ st@@ ment change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit was also set up in the army which monitors online content and persons accused of being denied the monarchy .
Thailand puts a stri@@ fe against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( maj@@ esty ) .
the war law was declared in Thailand on 20 May 2014 .
two days later , there was a coup in the army .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile the song &apos;s te@@ aser showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of ghost towns in eastern ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
now over 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ical war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the Kohl@@ enbe@@ ck of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Dep@@ u@@ ties , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and n@@ oses live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the county amounted to 16,@@ 000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
around 43,@@ 000 people lived in this district in 1989 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s that are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ kow@@ kas are symbo@@ lic@@ ally ac@@ counted for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are decay and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elderly man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were municipal m@@ alls , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that all minist@@ ered to the community .
now there is only paved road with blown @-@ out mag@@ nific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have now abandoned the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the ch@@ ry@@ ch@@ ow@@ ka , which are still one or two families , can be seen at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was simply forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girl@@ friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as livestock , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aunt G@@ AL@@ YA , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Gen@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
in spite of her el@@ dest daughter living in France Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will always remain in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial assistance from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59 year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink gro@@ oved frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in the Teddy B@@ ears form .
it is called Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.50 Dollars per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people to get in full mini@@ buses and from the top of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on boxes .
she does not want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy drugs that they cannot pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ sam the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him whether M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hoped to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to reach Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have lived in Brazil , however it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a builder on construction of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy grew weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replies , sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa but her guests taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house this winter .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered to them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job site .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from central America , and other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to extract money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a stranger , a remote student , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses , travellers quietly consult their teleph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems to be happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud Grand@@ mother she appears in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair@@ care she made her a female , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laugh@@ s sad while she puts her briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users will be granted
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority in the west of China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their cell phones .
on July 10th , the mobile users in the Tian@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which it instru@@ cts the district government to install a monitoring app called Jing@@ wang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities could also use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Aut@@ onom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , exchanged messages with a private e @-@ chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app was able to identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
Jing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
Jing@@ wang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Jiang@@ su Telec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking porno@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remote control their home network .
this app with the min@@ ors for min@@ ors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or ste@@ al from it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China focus mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ down@@ s .
the Media Out@@ let &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; based on Twitter , published the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the inhabitants indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately as to whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official j@@ ing@@ wang app .
a mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered on a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use appliances that are meant for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment through training technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China , &quot; also released a Jing@@ wang product description , out of which the software can lift the license requirement of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer .
after the installation of Jing@@ wang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are becoming electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the pres@@ crip@@ tions in Jing@@ wang are possibly a response to the instructions of the city party council to minim@@ ise the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal contents .
all government branches , authorities and affiliated organisations including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a current account of Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs , until August 1 , their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media storage cards &quot; at the local police register .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far away from our blue , virtual world , you look forward to realize that you are alone in a place where everything is important .
everything gradually dis@@ b@@ anded and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able both inside and outside .
one that makes its name all honor .
one that has cr@@ ushed into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if the reality brings you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings out of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts are dissolved in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when Earth continues on the axis of disaster . it becomes clear that you are tra@@ pped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone to stone stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough so that I could &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during peaceful protests like we@@ eds .
it was enough so that the city sh@@ ou@@ ted the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all districts were long@@ ing for , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t put any high demands on a city , which is fed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply ceased functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I listened to my voice through silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined to me ; we alli@@ ed to a splendid picture that fulfilled my expectations .
in such a moment you are aware that you fre@@ ed the mind from the lamp , but it &apos;s not interested in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet in the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low down - nothing can give you back your voice , after you s@@ wore it to you all the way to the office of security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are brave enough to cry when we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were directed at me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I wouldn &apos;t regret the word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father immediately with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal to his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office that leads through a gang to the individual cells .
I am interested in detail in detail before I enter the room .
unlike otherwise they have given me a bigger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share them with only one single prisoner and can immediately set me without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the be@@ amer left the cell , and I turned back on a well @-@ tried communication method : to beat with the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; first @-@ time chief . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me finally .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no distinctive features can be seen in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers are linked to his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ar . li@@ ar .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these cro@@ ws that are lab@@ elled on the fruit in the garden of my head .
from af@@ ar , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es are opening , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that the horror in person presented to us : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th acid of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was ventil@@ ated : to protect the state security before us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their sec@@ t@@ arian black@@ mail card and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view .
this is not a house here , which is not a land here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the crimin@@ als of their land into a hero .
I take care of the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation and tre@@ ad on Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that gli@@ de on him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest at demonstrations which will soon be an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have used it to me , not to answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and blo@@ ws have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to the punishment of being punished even though I had done nothing to earn this sentence .
to punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices at your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him and you cannot with@@ hold your cri@@ es .
my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t bo@@ ther him enough , why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage collector earlier or if it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still on the line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I ceased crying .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t find any favour in it , which is why he picked up an electri@@ cally charged rod .
stream chann@@ eled my whole body enough to supply my whole district .
my semi @-@ bare body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness van@@ ished and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me as minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus mit dir , Arsch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answered with the voice of an exhausted young@@ ster : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and keep you , you will be mis@@ placed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always fre@@ ed me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of speech and resistance
E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he turns to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and also to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his with ni@@ cot@@ ine spot@@ ted lips .
he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( for example : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who op@@ poses the conservative majority and sur@@ vey@@ ed its old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ tures .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only found in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ anz , but also in cities that go from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as a person who is not limited by limits in his thinking and can feel with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special aff@@ ection against US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b regards his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war @-@ areas , have anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian &quot; fle@@ dged from the second generation , &quot; he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a person , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he sol@@ dered N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in water in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancest@@ ral traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ sing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the s@@ lu@@ gs speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the s@@ quad@@ ron of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose is primarily of freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you have a look into the neighboring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from that point , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an drinking water - to avoid land in prison .
the Interior Ministry of Jordan has recently cancelled a performance by the M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; L@@ eil@@ a band , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action of action - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual tribute ham@@ ed Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , which contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for concert cancell@@ ations .
in an interview with CN@@ N , the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties and the former spokes@@ person on the Islamic coalition , Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b , said that the concert &quot; just &quot; was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also affir@@ m that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which challenges the well @-@ established legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; L@@ eil@@ a valued the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive supp@@ orter of human rights , &quot; which continues to be decided on an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement may not be simply shallow rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually reflects an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b reg@@ ained traditional gender norms by depic@@ ting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently dec@@ ayed woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives by the hands of those who were supposed to trust .
in the past few years , the number of hon@@ orary kill@@ ings took place in Jordan - the un@@ official outside left .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ orary kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still worse that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence to provide adequate support .
according to a law on the crime of crime from 1954 , women who are subjected to the risk of in@@ tra @-@ family violence can be imprison@@ ed for in@@ definite time in prison , and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures and the guarantee from the family that the woman will not do anything .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known for not shy away from subjects that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music that is full of explicit all@@ usions on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I got politics in@@ correctly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of the songs that are political at the core can be continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats itself often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be it belief or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone in Jordan is talking about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been heavily cens@@ ored up until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya , to later notice that his comments from the context were torn , twi@@ sted and cens@@ ored by his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is open to the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ was , who was to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph later , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service established several former members of government and members of the faculty association , argu@@ ing that in social media comment@@ aries expressed themselves cri@@ tically to the problems associated with the deeply rooted corruption in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the concert h@@ da@@ i@@ bs considers that only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for him , progress is permanent giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ rou &apos; L@@ eil@@ a for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ght@@ ful and internal changes .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a real and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not through bombs , uni@@ tions and artificial democra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until it happens , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will carry on further and consequently also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory states that the tro@@ l@@ leys , drums and dancing come from a period of time , in the armies of the west of Japan , mar@@ ched to the northeast to force the indigenous population of the region , the emission to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to take a few great seats , so we have a great view .
it is hard to imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking forward to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed @-@ cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! ! !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high fixed car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

outer appearances and body care rarely were as important as in this history , as they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate occupation like those of the bar@@ ber .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoke and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are common@@ place .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
at the same time Peru - as many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more and more regular citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
experts opposite each other to show who can create the most exac@@ ting looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions like the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dressing for the hair@@ dres@@ ser , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of you@@ ths have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
before the school year commen@@ cing in March , the school presented special training workshops and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine &quot; Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important , people who feel pushed out to accommodate aff@@ ection ?
the young Colum@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os Foundation touched exactly this question from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as por la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ación ( letter to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement COLO@@ C ( German : Revolution@@ ary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was deemed to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but before the Colom@@ bian soldiers there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ oric and carried out their weapons around the clock , must now re @-@ integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which has become ac@@ custom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take up their ranks and support them in setting up a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians had to join together and would have to help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation was created on the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this stated that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need much more .
he plan , he continued to share his love with people this year , who needed the most pressing response .
the plan was to write letters of hope and support for former milit@@ ants of the FAR@@ C , who now have to find their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history into a common history of peace , &quot; she says .
so far , more than 2000 letters have been collected in the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camp in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer letters .
the members of the FAR@@ C presented themselves as they had done it earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters of full support from people from all over the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings you can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian student Manuela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later told . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after we passed the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL Gran@@ at@@ werfer , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; then suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ g@@ ged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . to join the FAR@@ C was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices / voices
at the start , students and some leaders of the FAR@@ C gathered for a panel discussion .
the students were all grown up as already war and the FAR@@ C already acted in hiding .
therefore , the leaders of the FAR@@ C explained the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced how social injus@@ tice on the part of the state has been working on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party , we can help shape society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this magnit@@ ude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
to hear these people who have never heard heard before and had no right to vote , and to recognize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former war@@ ri@@ ors have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Arch@@ bishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian@@ ans were proph@@ esi@@ ed that after the dis@@ arm@@ ament peace would rule .
but this is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people willing to take up arms to rise and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the FAR@@ C now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those dre@@ aming of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and make sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties ahead .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with hor@@ r@@ ors activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed by a D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ cri@@ b on the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community is not originated over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic .
several months ago , the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya took over the international head@@ lines after reports published that dealt with the dep@@ ortation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Ch@@ echn@@ ya authorities who arrested susp@@ icious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
from her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned from the gender @-@ raising of her Land@@ s@@ woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
out of fear for her life she moved to the USA last time .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer assistant in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents passed through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you of your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned around I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want to honour the family , you sc@@ andal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and awak@@ ened the last end of the hospital .
apparently some women had to get along and started crying .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary wing .
OC Media : in which cases were you placed - in which the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dep@@ rec@@ ated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
for that I am very thank@@ ful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he went with me resp@@ ect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they set absurd demands : some told me that I must prove it by running up without going through the streets ; others wanted me to go to Gros@@ ny on the official TV and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex , that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has ashamed not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around his neck .
luck@@ ily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and already a few hours later a car was standing under the window with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the number tags - it turned out that I was followed .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought myself a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought them without regi@@ stering me without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and check@@ out into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;d be sure , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender ine@@ qualities , this is a t@@ abo@@ o issue .
some traditionally Cub@@ an items I still carry within me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this mental barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera I really try to look like the person that she reminds of her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for those I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to someone who has imprison@@ ed one and a half months in ar@@ gun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he told us that during Ram@@ ad@@ an there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still det@@ ained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : an acquain@@ tance of me says that there were not so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ wort &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know they are held there , so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV , claiming they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply gone , but deliberately immersed in order to radi@@ c@@ alize themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was det@@ ained in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard has grown .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even present when these people were taken along .
until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible .
why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to s@@ have themselves ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already known in very big ny , when I was still living there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , then it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia intended to lead us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the stone age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the law of the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had dy@@ ed las@@ hes , bore tube jeans and short t@@ ops .
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria never har@@ ms me just a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , was a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Ch@@ echn@@ ya language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to be children if they make fun of sick .
OC Media : so they just shut their eyes closed to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never insul@@ ted me , never h@@ unted and never sm@@ itten .
OC Media : how long did this prob@@ ation period hold ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began talking on television about mor@@ ality .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless , one could sense how people began to change in the city .
those who had been sm@@ iling and laugh@@ ed before were at once concerned with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily worse .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I still work as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a cent for it for a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have discovered these people myself when I ap@@ ologi@@ zed refuge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is true .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion at all .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to tell you with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no bo@@ b@@ bin@@ s with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dents have which , the cab@@ ar@@ ins have which , the Russians have which ; on the whole planet they are - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live together with men .
do you know many think of transi@@ tions to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all because of that - I simply know that I am now myself .
local Gro@@ ups warn against an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ mad@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian ancest@@ or region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
for the past few months there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ va@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August was the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ i community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , in the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ h in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , the in@@ ability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ n@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
a video that was fil@@ med on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to clear the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the city of Ah@@ va@@ z .
according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide which happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ i minority , and activists on the ground warn against the fact that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ we@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe job .
Arab Ah@@ mad@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a majority of the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ i community living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their li@@ veli@@ hood .
a century ago , the Arab region of A@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy in all Iran .
in the Ah@@ la@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little from this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated disease , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime den@@ ies the Ah@@ mad@@ i Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries .
the rate of unemployment among the A@@ haw@@ zi adol@@ escents rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ mad@@ ine@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the mind of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ n@@ az@@ i men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the adjustment process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ mad@@ i is depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their li@@ veli@@ hood out of their native ancest@@ or .
there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ mad@@ i and be hired as even Arabic names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , let alone the speech of the Arab language or wearing Arab clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ i must end@@ ure , human rights activists propose alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and published originally on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
they can be read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even think well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ists .
for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women still stand under strict observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women encounter a glass ceiling earlier or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is known to me and known .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in terms of ra@@ cial seg@@ reg@@ ation and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists decide to remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , everyone agre@@ es that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sing my Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence there is a institution@@ alised form of institution@@ alised violence that we are subjected to black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold way .
or that black women and women of other ethnic and home countries deserve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women to have the same rights for all men , all men and all men at all . on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands , ref@@ using to consider injus@@ tice in her mind , which refers to both gender and the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer have to fight for my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner said in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in a historical sense is a men@@ ac@@ eful and margin@@ alised being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join the group@@ ings , which also by cultural appropri@@ ation absorb our customs and customs so as to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer attempt to suggest white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and sex . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of femin@@ ism , called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana pot@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ( for example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) speaks of defending ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces in which they can be completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped , which constitute the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atis@@ m and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to find out about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized as part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life has neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected .
pad@@ dle against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that was in@@ famous about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a has been traveling over the last 7 years - mostly with surf@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Organization , a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - dedicated to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a sums up the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was fil@@ med and published for En@@ sia by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film based in Er@@ bil , Iraq , and multimedia journ@@ alism .
the focus of her work is based on persec@@ uted , poor@@ ly respected sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of collaborative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with which help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult struggle against violence

the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article entitled &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Ag@@ ainst Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tural . article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most of the names were changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her exp@@ orter , who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship a little time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done .
as another mist@@ ress Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed sus@@ pic@@ ion for mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also showed an acute ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez .
a few days later , the second wife returned her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women occur at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases women are also financi@@ ally dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence can be reported to the law enforcement authorities at all .
inhal@@ t@@ 1 blo@@ ws and statisti@@ cians 2 invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system that nothing under@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation blo@@ ws and statistics
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are various indications and reports , which do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the figures available are alarm@@ ing .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads were prosec@@ uted for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the adverti@@ sements in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 adver@@ ts due to domestic violence in peace courts . also here 86 % of women &apos;s ads came .
in the adverti@@ sements , 40 % of women said that they were physically ill @-@ treated , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi only few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; to each woman who ref@@ uses ad in Paraguay because of mental abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the genocide in Paraguay is not a separate crime , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequ@@ ately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year .
by August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of genocide in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , a woman in Paraguay dies every ten days due to violence through men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do it , but after that she was supposed to regret it forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she en@@ du@@ red the psychological force on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recogni@@ zable :
I never thought I would become victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ missive , because they let themselves be fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook , in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had liked this so long by Carlos and did not leave him sooner .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated .
Victoria is a member of the Network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testimon@@ ies of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with mental abuse .
their prosper@@ ous partner eventually managed to convince them that it was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s ads in the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives , they did not receive support .
it led a process against its former partner , which developed into an un@@ predict@@ able j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal struggle between Paraguay and its home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but are not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # princ@@ ess ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the Movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Min@@ os ( # Non@@ unity ) are part of a campaign supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ suicide is to be declared an independent off@@ ence and to pun@@ ish har@@ sh@@ ly as is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the law text was changed in some respects to also win the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law which advoc@@ ated that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is generally prohibited and punished with up to five years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill was intended to pay the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must be borne by themselves , if they simply ref@@ uses to provide notification and would like to receive a secure accommodation to the state .
Ik@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ thinking must take place here , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who are silent in the face of these facts makes themselves guilty and contribute to the fact that the perpet@@ rators come away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to report as long as ill @-@ treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed , among other things , a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fil@@ ing of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after the b@@ anning of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their coverage of corruption in the Sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he is serving a one @-@ year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed in court .
since 1970 , Oman is ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had depos@@ ited his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sult@@ an , he is the most important mini@@ stri@@ es in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces , Minister of Defence , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , restrictions and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ dating and det@@ ained .
the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) since its inc@@ eption in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , stated that an article entitled &quot; High Level parties tied up hands of justice &quot; was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a judgment in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was charged by the ISS before the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS captured Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite period after the Minister of Information had given the instruction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited on any way , including online , as of August 9 , 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial in Mas@@ ate took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , for disturb@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on public prohibition and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year vocational ban imposed on the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information net for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could pose a danger to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US Dollars ) was established and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Court of App@@ eal spoke free to Al @-@ Abr@@ i during a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month sentence from the central prison in Mask@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j continued to be in prison where he served his imprisonment sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the Court &apos;s decision to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the paper continues to face attacks by the Iranian government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on January 8th , the Minister of Information published an order with which the closure of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was extended by three months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and which the minister once again asked for the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
further injuries include the closure of the website of the independent journal Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j the impression arises that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Iranian authorities :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j will release immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their right@@ ful human rights work without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial sham@@ ans .
the Gulf center for human rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to gather , support and provide them with protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Fig@@ ure takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research on @-@ site medical research : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious consequences in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself expl@@ ores the HIV virus before he decided to go back home in order to support the Serbian healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( dis@@ claimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I currently set up a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
that has to change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers instead of being makers ourselves .
the solutions we get are often not well applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where does the funding and support come from ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
which obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system means that magazines are only available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limited to the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change world food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about possible solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ sh@@ ad@@ ming , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NA@@ SA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited by his own imagination and the question of how many types of sal@@ ads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents are not only suited for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or bev@@ elled leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or anti@@ trust types . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food safety for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on still bre@@ eds let@@ tu@@ ce , but now he needs longer because his work is increasingly difficult for his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if there were a bou@@ lder in a river , around which I must sw@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go too far on sal@@ ads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new salad , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot; thus , it continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants .
however , he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement which is becoming ever greater in the US and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; trains ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red red@@ dish salad of the &quot; greenhouse &quot; variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there , it is tested to see if plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather like that the movement origin@@ ates from the IT department and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are therefore permanently usable for plant bre@@ eders .
within the framework of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , U.S. bre@@ eders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others who buy seeds , to breed it , to breed their own varieties , and not immediately send out - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ente .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects for the future
for the em@@ eri@@ fied Professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ di@@ son and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in greater cl@@ ashes such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter or only little by bre@@ wing seeds with natural res@@ ili@@ ence .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not occupied with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically altered or not , from ecological farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says and takes care of the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , as it is offered on farmers markets , but should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to providing others their seeds freely . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics .

Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed as the available gene pool shr@@ inks due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights of plant material , which is therefore increasingly restricted , shr@@ inking continuously .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ SS@@ I , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found that about one third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it usable for plant bre@@ eders either at all or only ag@@ grav@@ ated .
for other plants , there are no such estimates yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by believe that grown plants like wheat in even greater style are patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ r@@ ots .
a question of view
plants are grown in such a way that they exhibit desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or color improves to those due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and with@@ stand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eders dimin@@ ishes through more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently more important than ever since the changed conditions by climate change are much worse predi@@ ctive .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto recogni@@ zes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company en@@ vis@@ es the conservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradi@@ cts that intellectual property advoc@@ ates other bre@@ eders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to get to the same result using another method .
thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , it promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees this differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have already lost the battle .
however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders do not have the time or money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to facilitate their work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be made impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mort@@ on is bo@@ ther@@ ed by the concept of patented herbal features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form themselves and as bre@@ eders we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also breed their own values in them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation of mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , bre@@ eds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that are active in international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , they create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents . either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on looks for Sal@@ ata in his breeding garden .

Mort@@ on also believes that bre@@ eders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks as if I was using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented .
I need a constantly new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties themselves in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one is protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
although the US seems to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly across the globe .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , introduces a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seeds of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ e is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a more form@@ id@@ able and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I commitment for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding vary from country to country , so the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot simply be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
one explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ vos organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmer , operator of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for pat@@ enting seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ vos &apos; programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which scheduled next year will be the official starting signal .
a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ vos , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a link that Lu@@ by from O@@ SS@@ I hopes that more people will soon recognize him .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has particular attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that even more is behind their food . &quot;

all winners received certificates as souven@@ irs and other awards , such as souven@@ irs with the competition logo or gift vou@@ chers for online shops .
the authors of the 11 photos with the highest jur@@ ys and cont@@ est@@ ants who photograph@@ ed most of the objects and were able to collect most points in the overall score were honoured with the prizes .
other awards were awarded by other organizations who joined the competition .
for example , the employees of the nature park Hol@@ osi@@ iv@@ sky@@ i , who is located in the metrop@@ olitan region of Kiev , have chosen the three best photos taken in a designated park and submitted to the competition .
in addition , in the national competition there were also some special categories : &quot; Un@@ pleasant Discovery , &quot; which documents the destruction of natural habit@@ ats , initiated by NGOs from the environmental sector , an overview of the subjects , in which photos on Wikipedia were missing the best wildlife photos and best Kiev photo

human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest Zen@@ sur goals in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of the 5th August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and report them above .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August has published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic network for human rights information remains unknown despite this attack and the violation of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , who should defend the law of defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as it is now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the network of Al J@@ aze@@ era on alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of web page closures to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada does not have access to more in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of columns and articles he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog he set up was to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Zi@@ adas blog is located , on the other hand , it is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video , how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and human rights in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him :
blocking blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blocking of the blog might not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been successful for them to convey to me the feeling of a si@@ ege ; an arrest , a temp@@ ted murder , sum@@ mons at national security council , blocking blogs , as well as any other web page for which I worked .
2 ) They have proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 sites from 24 May to 06@@ th August . this gave technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of vendors , through the transformation of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( VPN )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ PN@@ s has started .
such practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is compo@@ unded by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can proceed against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants dispute .
the Brazilian Army was deployed in the fav@@ elas in N@@ iter@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

day after day newspapers in whole Brazil report with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day is assass@@ inated a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ ber@@ y pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ he sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years in Rio .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 , published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new category called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper said the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper said that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war of war in a country that does not recognize war at all .
in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the paper writes :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to do so , atro@@ cities of the police which first sho@@ ots and then ques@@ tioned questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; does the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harm more than it protects ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oliv@@ eira ar@@ gues to design@@ ate violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could complic@@ ate the responsibility of the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing negle@@ ct of public service .
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mor@@ dr@@ ates per state , Rio is ranked 16th , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media enterprise in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia emphas@@ ises , has been repe@@ ating the country &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by using a massive police unit and permanently station@@ ing one unit there .
in the beginning , this indeed led to a decrease of violent deaths . for several years , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under bombar@@ d@@ ment after several reports of ch@@ ic@@ ans and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities that should protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux was quoted from one of his articles from 2010 , explaining why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people .
for this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical for a war . this involves entering into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; with which a civilian is an un@@ clear point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; aber@@ rant bul@@ lets . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of fav@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer .
one week it is now that the police killed the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ chard died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicop@@ ter .

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms

source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where chemical weapons attack the lives of hundreds of civilians on August 21st 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume the basis of the UN investigation and other human rights organisations that the Assad regime massac@@ red .
since 2013 , these rebels insp@@ ected areas outside Damascus , which led people to rely on locally produced or tun@@ nels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become in@@ accessible to large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the conventional food crops planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the director of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said AF@@ P to the French news agency :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been struggling for three years to announce this project and expressed its relief that it is now becoming more and more &quot; well @-@ known . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da , use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform c@@ ando .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge to plant@@ ing fung@@ i , such as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around € 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to c@@ ando on Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the short@@ age of fuel , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of pil@@ es from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards they plant a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms all over East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to contribute to people the fung@@ al breeding for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking the si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ du@@ es ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our struggle against hunger and si@@ ege is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many district capital cities in Portugal on October 21 and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ra@@ ced in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and approximately 70 were injured following the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that last week the government issued a call for solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 hot out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite images , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon area .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

numerous videos are spread in the web and show pictures that allow better insights into what happened :
the Trage@@ dy tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked themselves why civil protection was unable to contain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ ale from the Bund der Landwir@@ te of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there could have been a similar tragedy like in June as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits are inter@@ viewed in locations with a high risk of fire .
a far @-@ reaching reform proposal made by the government for serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed construction activity in case the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made aware that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of lightly fl@@ amm@@ able wood , are spreading like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to the fires of this kind .
these problems are caused by the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when citizens searched or tried to contact relatives , offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire department and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers were not able to with@@ stand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who pursued the fires , the website mat@@ tered more than half a million hits .

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati and his friend and colleague Y@@ as@@ in Tan@@ in in Venice .

in one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups , who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair .
at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the eth@@ ni@@ city of Haz@@ ara , in the province G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afgh@@ an for the last time together with his family during dinner .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy was to break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ protected .
the Taliban , known for their hatred , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ hesi@@ on pit . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little wage , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a strange country with other refugees and drag@@ ged s@@ acks with mort@@ ar that were he@@ avier than himself to earn his living .
back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was no service there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we were not frozen at night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected asylum , A@@ shar@@ af returned to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid need@@ y twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high ratings . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe human rights organisation writes , the system suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised installations in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - what can be drawn up after the registration of the asylum request for months .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his in@@ mate life @-@ wil@@ le helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions very soon .
after spending several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af cont@@ ended his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and fast food .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind vene@@ tian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution to other European countries .
in recent years , a number of Afgh@@ an companies were created , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen personnel are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals reach far beyond the Italian hospitality sector and retail outlets and aim back to the country which he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are also opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ k also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey herself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that sees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after a registration with a government agency .
users would need to be able to use the social networks within six months of a successful law@@ suit on the authority &apos;s website , stat@@ ing their full name and their ID number .
those who negle@@ ct this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the en@@ su@@ ing of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which was adverti@@ sed by sixty members of Parliament , is currently on the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may another deputy set up a legislative proposal in which harder pun@@ ishments would be introduced for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law proposal , such a de@@ ed would be punished with pris@@ ons and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ rir Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned .
in addition , it would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he exercised Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup that had led the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , as more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested for the same incident , four years in cust@@ ody on a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the prison management , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison into the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threatened the death penalty for one , so many human rights groups agree , false loads of inter alia weapons of arms , illegal assembly , murder and murder .
in another case , a criminal tri@@ bunal opened in Giza the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ vi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the incident previously mentioned , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tun@@ isian activists to inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated documents
in May , Tun@@ isian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated to a ro@@ cked action plan . said Plan was written by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , strongly supports a controversial bill of bill backed by business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption .
the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at thro@@ ws a light on how the pre@@ dic@@ tional plans to support the legal situation look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused the nom@@ ination of his sources , stat@@ ing Article 11 of the Tun@@ isian press code , which crimin@@ alis@@ es journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he appeared in the District Court in Tun@@ is on May 09 as a witness .
does China want to force users of social media to present their identity ?
according to the information offices of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need a permit before writing or sharing messages in social media .
in the regulations , it is also stated that registration will be required with the full real name .
analysts susp@@ ect that by elimin@@ ating anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks it is un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to en@@ force these provisions only selective in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; do we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may the state cens@@ orship of Russia shut up access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Ros@@ com@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register in the state government as the &quot; organizer of information prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
this designation is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government carries out a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for removing content and forcing it on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites are currently under web pages such as V@@ Kontakte and Od@@ no@@ klass@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service Mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has blocked Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court had wi@@ dening Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to ext@@ ingu@@ ish two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey support the ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was closed because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups to address a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey blocks the website completely . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop w@@ aking up
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with increased surveillance powers that would force internet providers to monitor communications in real time and install back@@ door programs that encryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services relating to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population out@@ war@@ dly .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
