<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became mainly a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Brief, a fearless reporter, who covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free from Method Man," "" "I was as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very dirty love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never thinks behind the mountain as he says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague expresses it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmericans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number that a candidate nominally nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not harmonise Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that takes people from all over the world, a deeply believer person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "mumps of the worldview also agreed not with the present editor of the" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "", "the present editor of the" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">The intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr who struggled for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump made his way to the nominal republican presidential candidate, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly whites, gave the presidency a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people voted for trump because they shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think differently in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom know, voted for trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commentates on the cruel decision to rise up a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "whitelash" "" "(note: as much as" "" "whites against all other ethnicities" "" "; word game from white in reference to the whites and whiplash, which means" "" "Schleudertrauma" "" "), as the great Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has done so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America is always welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the election of Donald Trumps there is a huge part of the White Americas on this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all that I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who died in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of wording with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "Donald Trump," "" "would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "" "asked Mr. Khan." ""</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a seat in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a seat in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone who is not like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "" "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." "" "36 hours later he was corrected." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places, not only has changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the apostasy</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the congregation of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and gave the youth a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments vis-à-vis the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to meet their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They are always laughing and playing with shiny eyes, playing trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, woodhorn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village located practically on top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays capital - on instruments produced from recycled material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with revived instruments made up of local solid waste materials made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers have started turning parts of the waste into instruments under the direction of Favio Chávez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violin, viola, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophone, trumpet, trombones and percussion, all of which were made of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra and so on.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The kids did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments from recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of trash every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring drama from rubbish-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project fighting wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practised solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication is done as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were thus upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal offender of this type on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized fast against the ship. they refused to attack one of their harbours and refused to grant him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that simply denied anything" "", "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishery authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at his time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: he was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to looting of the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative that crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishery).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries, which at that time evicted the premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is trapped is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snail-empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries, for example, exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also attends the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships fishing in prohibited areas. also, such suspicious routes can be discovered - such as suggest that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license, where they were on the road and possibly also if they have a blast furnace.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then deny the acceptance of such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information. what does the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then it comes to substantial financial losses for the owner, meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and this is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, head director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The so-called platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue, which lost the eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of the illegal fishermen who enter East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts the region's commercial fishing from all over the world. among these are also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions like sailing under false flag, counterfeit licence papers, stating of fantasies, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbridled control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You may not run my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say 'Come to me'." "" "and this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far, the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed counterfeit licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for the fight against crime, FISH-i may share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system capable of helping FISH-i to detect suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, for example, with which they can no longer be geared by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that combines different levels of information. it is designed to help FISH-i to find criminalizing ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana marine protection organisation: a platform that offers satellite data and by which the position of every single traceable ship can be displayed throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "gather together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what they do - that's just sense," "" "he says." "" "here's a chance for countries to unite and join their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project to run in which a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had been fished without a license and hardly had to face any consequences now know that they are being monitored.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have meanwhile become a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After which FISH-i Somalia had helped detecting Greko 1, the inspectors found Schleppnetze on board, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "Kiilu says." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars will disappear every year through illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015 six countries joined together to form the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also combat illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "" "safety is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship under false flag. and not only was the ship on the way without a license and used towing nets that are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "by taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans is actually working throughout the world.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This image by María Alejandra Mora shows a close up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="156">Published under the Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="157">After the Venezuelan government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness by meeting on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the recoil of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the territory of the country of Barinas, in the Andes regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the centre of the federal state of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteriorating, which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venezuelans through an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the Opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicolás Maduro; ultimately, the deportation of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, co-acting with Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the governmental decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum applied for many as the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance of Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or a short MUD (for example: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, the demonstrators gathered to support the National Assembly on October 27, as well as a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government headquarters, on November 3, the blocking of the referendum would continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil war and on 3 November all to Caracas to the Miraflores palace.</seg>

<seg id="170">"" "the first demonstration in the context of the action programme" "" "The Return of Venezuela" "" "took place on Wednesday, 26 October." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">The images of the marches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country, but also confrontations with policemen and supporters of the government.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, pictures that tell about confrontations, as well as reports of repression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Particularly large waves hit the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators returned to the local Cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andean State Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not carry skirts because otherwise you could see something that many National Guard did not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic makes the round, which forms the amount of suppression a day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a counterpart proceedings - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road.</seg>
<seg id="185">Mytcookie Media Labs for this:</seg>
<seg id="186">Nicolás and Diosdado assert that 1% of signatures are falsified.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your impeachment!</seg>

<seg id="189">Others evaluate these protests as another step in the fight against a government that has undergone little against the devastating economic crisis and prefers to keep critical voices silent:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">The marches always increase in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentine news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to see the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now said to his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father, to the brutal military operations at La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father, Luis Alberto Quijano, was a senior officer. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the Intelligence Department, 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, charged with kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who recognized the extent of the atrocities he had experienced as a boy, and who testified against a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose for himself a way of redemption.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese town of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong his driving license, witnessed a very unsuccessful translation last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign the Japanese word (koreidopa), which means "older motorists," was wrongly translated - perhaps also with bad rear-thanks & # 8212; translated as "awful drivers."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyoto. he was also who drew attention to the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">Kyoto Shimbun's appearing in Kyoto wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>

<seg id="356">The faulty English translation was initially removed. the name of the envoc drivers was later replaced by the appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct term "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received by the translator, and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published.</seg>

<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older motorists who are involved nationally in accidents is quite a reason to worry." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Prefecture of Kyoto, for example, 1,941 were caused by a total of 19,460 deaths from seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1,803 of altogether 11,850 accidents.</seg>

<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors increased in the same period.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, one needs two important abilities: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be in the source language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, French native speakers should translate from English into French - not translated into English by French.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language who could translate translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons, or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, make translations still in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to be a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The sworn and enigmatic sets that are created by machine translation show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages quite special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English expressions in Japan, including the puzzling prints, which often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from large companies or government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto hopefully uses a more serious source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Mainpage of the Portals "navegar con Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vivoplay online transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="393">Other users later wrote that the internet presentations of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels contributed to the recordings of the protests in Caracas, organized by oppositional groups, which the Nicolás Maduros government resisted.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the duties of parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was capped, and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: enables your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that websites of Venezuelan providers are again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet page.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media has been reluctant in reporting on protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they would continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw it as a call for violence.</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is astonishing that it is still cheaper to buy two litre of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible due to a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two more online channels. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique whereby the DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server replies faulty or refuses the request to call such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third seperated channel, the broadcast was suspended on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was struck while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later, and VPITV went on mission again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections: thus, the Venezuelans are becoming increasingly difficult to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="423">The business is simple: a large family with little money transfers their minors-year-old son or her minor-year-old daughter to another, more richer family. in exchange, the child gets food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children must pay innumerable days of housework that will never be paid and will be victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of an agreement that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">The practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>

<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays for instance, she cleaned the fridge, soiled the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was finished, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner it was done with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time too was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"" "Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also did not have unlimited food." "" "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," "" "she recalls." ""</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathisers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">Some evenings forced the landlord Alvarenga to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>

<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed to lose, they explained.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them, with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also at school Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing about which almost never is spoken is mobbing and the shamans who are exposed to criaditas when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, is a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to go home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time where friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I belong to no group.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the conservative daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, has been making progress that has been hit in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" in March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom bomb in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. the prefecture of Miyagi was an unusual prefect in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate because the tsunami had all coastal towns to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the Fukushima Prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, already on the other hand, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from the local point of view, which progress has been reached six years later in order to rebuild the life of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">"" "" "" "the detailed report of the newspaper covers statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those affected by themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures saw Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, even six years after the disaster, evacuated by instructional shelters (tentatively afternoons, kasetsu juutaku) are converted into final spare-houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful in this case. more than 75 percent of the evacuated patients were resettled to final homes after the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="558">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1,074 of 1,100 schools affected by misfortune have opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are back in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operation at Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have largely affected agricultural land in the three prefectures of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the farmland used in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima lie in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far downcast.</seg>
<seg id="567">The number of tourists in Miyagi and Iwate is up to 90 percent on the same level as before the accident. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only be 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total image, the newspaper led numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuation. she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and also how her empathy has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to evacuate from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23,000 people resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent surrounds.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuated patients who still live in accommodation establishments are older than 50 years old. they need to be recalled in correct homes because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">If you encounter people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be bigger at first than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, after a while, one often recognizes that a more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global links are important as they challenge our prejudices, extend our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we are looking at exactly these global links. in our Into the Deep Podcast we handle issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Krikoni talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherita explains how the love of music remembers the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="600">On the pictures is also to recognize the face of the police officer who attacked a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio had been suspended until the end of the examination of the incident by the active ministry.</seg>

<seg id="603">If a police officer detects from a demonstrator and land on the intensive station, his face would be visible for six months on television and the entire oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desktalizador," a media channel of media activists from Goiânia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz, in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several medics shortly hurry to him.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories joined the doors in Cuba (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as El Central - on the Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After flying, the sugar cane industry was still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffold of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves anew.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories, which still ground.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugar cane industry doesn't rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are back in operation after a long inactive time, because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds itself exactly that in Mañalen I would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910-produced quantity.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country several decades ago, but the bad harvests are not a new thing anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old rail platform of the community already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they were unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 centavos (0,03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose from about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars between 15 and 16 Centavos must remain per pound according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Economic and Nutrition Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate circa 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly enter history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on began the process of restructuring in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories arrived, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "if Nene, as known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, is the word he is most repeated," "" "scam." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all surveyed were in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents that would be distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed, addressing the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was overcrowded and the letters were becoming more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the commissioned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waits for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved against his will at the shutdown of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities throughout Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do this by hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour, mobile recording studios have been leading directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song writing, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop-Gruppe The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"" "the workshop thus increases that the young participants in discussions like" "" "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance" "" "or whatever comes to mind." ""</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribal of the Kitswkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of Tears," a road section in West Canada, where almost two dozen usually indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths are not always able to speak the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus will be sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from Northstar hip-hop group, who gave them a stophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan there is a transcript available, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will consume our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and continue our youth as well</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what it determines the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see in front of almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, near the entrance of shokuhin sanpuru (petals, "Plastic models of dishes") are issued by every dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokicker district of Kappabashi there are a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders has documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so customary that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend now turns them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matoma published the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in the special sale: new mobile ribbons decorated with plastic dishes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collectibles as in this case, refrigerator magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition in Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food perceptions is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for mobile, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comical.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case IKURA or salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anybody who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon roe?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise your colleagues or family members uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone support has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skurrile plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # carving posts # to the shelf.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which devotes itself to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports in- and foreign media on the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses, such as El Chapo Guzmán, chief of the Sinaloa Cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind any corpse, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal político has launched the digital project "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "live with drug trafficking") that will give these victims a voice and tell stories about people who were in the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug traffickers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear changed life") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret graves for his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father only one day, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves to seek and to seek graves, according to the people we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>

<seg id="768">"" "on October 15th, he should be back again, but he never came again." "" "Emma Veleta:" "" "it is very hard for me, because I am now alone with three children who need training." ""</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who is also here with me.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are entitled to the assurance of my father, but it does not get paid off, because they require a death certificate.</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been acquainted with illness and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come across a newspaper kiosk every day and see the cover pages with pictures that can only originate from a textbook for criminology or from files from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug trafficker) if he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students will be justified in a neighbor village that they were" "" "resident" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to persuade them to be spared by such tragedies, if they are not stirring and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the main city district," as a family has been plundered by threats. "it describes how an armed criminal had spent money from their business month for month, until they had destroyed not only the business but also torn apart their family.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain in this never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I wondered in these terrible days if weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation drawn by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, fry potatoes, warm tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells about the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, who saw bloody crawls of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as violence by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez mixed.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Prosecution was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8,5 killings per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal político 2015 has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been misleading to commit tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank wagon crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, it fell victim to the tanker.</seg>
<seg id="828">Government representatives described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses including a movie in the vicinity, which was full of people watching the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and wired corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture titled "Das ist Nigeria." from Imgur-User Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are strung on the ground while people are watching them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But the story does not end here.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photograph was researched several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and wrongly attributed to real, but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Yewitnesses reported drastic atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">Reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one left back to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were shattered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between military Nigeria and the attempt by the Boko Haram to gain land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was mistakenly shown to be evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">08.11.2015 | Desperate Housewives</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abortions; Africa Check has documented conjunctions to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further brings personal comments like this, for example, the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a blitz announcement, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee strokes, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture originates from an Saudi Arabian news page that falsely claimed President Myanmar's Thein Sein have said, monks and politicians had taken part in the assassination of Rohingya Muslim. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to instruct this information.</seg>

<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images readers and viewers desensitize readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study, which investigated how violent media work to help others).</seg>

<seg id="948">A word or expression does not suffice, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find, for example, words from the Mwotlap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Remember your parents in recognition of how you have tried in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to contact someone in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the insurmountable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland, in the United States, where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk that small and not very small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening frequently is connected with it," "" "these events are rather" "" "listening to" "" "to appreciate, to make sense." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers present their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and their depiction lead to the fact that the audience insists.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history from Burkina Faso that is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the traditions typical for their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the Fabel of the rabbit and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the importance of his beak, John Nyamusara is asked: "how to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his feeling of intimacy:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. anyone who is inspired by the project can get in touch with TLS to organize their own story-telling performances.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the goal of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017. the march started at the Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference on the digital culture hosted in Berlin, an event devoted to the # FreePool campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'book sprints' books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published last year and is freely available here, contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what is the real cost to which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and writers who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create something meaningful out of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free bassel Khartabil, the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteers who have been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison where he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel is paying a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us begin thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people who pretended to be insiders of Assad's government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">But its place of residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of creative commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project that Bassel founded, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bastille's cultural prototypes was more provocative than the work that he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything about it, this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel had not yet completed this project.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life surrounded by freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked him. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a prodigal that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They smuggled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to work at the state apparatus at which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants, together with four other defendants.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from the public funds of the Airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good lead and immediately called for his re-setting to the company, which happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which issued the motion, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza, to refer back to his old post, as the company did not perform disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to re-establish its director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary procedure against the conflicting one.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company seems to be silent and does not cause any reasonable legal action to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>

<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish the image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent he has consented to become reintegrated into the company he helped to cause damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly be paid for his silence.</seg>

<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director is no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza pleases to return morality and to serve the state, * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served herself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as handele it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself is weary of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to data from Facebook users in Myanmar, the known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word "Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people ostindian origin or generally used as an adjective 'Indian'.</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook acts as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely diminishing connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts, in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for their use, were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several Burmese words with fundamentally different meanings, which have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair on Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spalterbse), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknitting Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a spiritual way whether they knew how he could alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The movement ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before releasing all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook deletes the word" "" "Kalar" "" "not manual." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you are writing on a facsimile.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words by side.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who distribute hate speech receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to cut off their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to anyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started deleting his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"" "ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to post and share content for 24 hours because the post" "" "didn't match the Facebook community standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">"" "" "" "Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative purposes or who simply try to show their opinions on the hate speech of radical nationalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have more to do before the beginning of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as "chair" or "hereditary curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they didn't try to correct the fake posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Laptops automatic censorship has ensured a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now laugh about Facebook and deliberately write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the web.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech, but they were removed:</seg>

<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should also stimulate violence in the communities of Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where confrontations between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to control the proliferous hate speech on his Burmese sites.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look more in context than on code focusing initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which were anxious to abolish laws for children's marriage, followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support. no doubt they helped bring about this outcome.</seg>

<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris, Al rawi, advocates a proponent of the law, it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject differently.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring websites, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright legislation in the US, internationally versed.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based Encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technology-driven Internet users are used to use bypassing tools for blocked websites (a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia customers do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has blocked articles from Wikipedia as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains blocked, there are now several mirrors (sites that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform cleared all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralised peer-to-peer network (i.e. host computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">Despite legal prohibition, the content is also available.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (about the block from Wikipedia), we put everything in mind to transfer snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents on decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was done independent of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has brought both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirrors page of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar manirrors when blocked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla at the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One attacks another URL that is not the original. that which one sees then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server transfers the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj called me (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father, that on the shore of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the Leopard found himself and I immediately began to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal and want to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he had already faced Tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the King of the Bucumber appeared. he immediately starts to see us and he stares me through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent in order to take photographs of adders at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, it is possible to avoid women with the utmost care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that they respect the husband because of the social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, maintain this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, malati Mahatoto from the Indian State Odisha was condemned by a false court and violated by her family and the village community after having addressed a married family with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives as well is also common among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and were thus quickly becoming the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is run by the community of video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices, such as children's marriage and deportation of HIV- and AIDS-infected ones, and heads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of the change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in its panel discussion was women who did not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"" "" "" "to pronounce the name of their husbands to speak loudly, is a custom that they all dutifully maintain and never questioned." ""</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini comments:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered a deceitful woman, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">"" "" "" "the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this panel discussion." ""</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband, wanted to try out at home how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent until the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini launched her first discussion club with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then they all asked, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of a centuries-old tradition in which married women could never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was only sitting in front of him, another decided to release the whole dusty frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline rush to have broken with an age-old custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead that shows the spellatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred dot if he did.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not fully belong to it, but they think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">"" "" "" "for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals." ""</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip to every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to make sure who what could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say things loud, no matter how small they happen to be.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only used saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most this is okay, but some wanted to wear a Salwar courta, a wide shirt over a pants, they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the advantages of his own choice of clothes, the morality associated with the saris and much more, smugged Rohini her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a panel discussion so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club has changed, Rohini confirms that things are slowly rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only taken small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then again they stopped saying the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred at any time on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like taking part in more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also there.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home in the club and telling other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29th of this year, the hashtag was to be held on the hashtag of the Yubei Twitter trend in the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of post-war era.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, marked the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese sizes had reached its zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail trade, Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Today the Beatles commemorative day in Japan is today. they were here 51 years ago in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles-Gedenktag.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "I don't know if this" "" "Winnie the Pooh" "" "doll is to represent John Lennon or not." ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese also make pilgrimages to the well-known places associated with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, that's your 5 places you absolutely must visit</seg>

<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles-Gedenktag.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year too.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course, some companies also use the fan community in terms of market technology, such as the Ramen Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for a day?</seg>

<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently, they confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a cat-headed man can bring gold or bring wealth, declared the BBC's spokesperson on the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with alcoholism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN 2016 in South Africa conducted a mission to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, particularly in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of temporary individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also acknowledges that a faith exists, according to which the victims were in the head of power, the riches.</seg>

<seg id="1603">I MÖCHTE likes to go A Land in which people would have shame to go to the streets as if they would like to challenge sex with good notes, work and other achievements, a nation in which people would be ashamed to earn their bread, a country where neither the Albinos nor bald or bald-headed for superstitious purposes or "black magic" are hunted.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer at the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (endangerment) after he had taken part in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as" "" "an internal affair" "" "and told a spokesman, he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nonetheless, China still maintains calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are fully wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>

<seg id="1640">Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Alan's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway fell into stump after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 2010 to Liu, although the Norwegian Government informed that this ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued to resume in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the laughing trip to China, as exports had largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was not able to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>

<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The EU's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius as she said in a statement on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr. Lius wife as well as family members.</seg>

<seg id="1663">Canada (in english)</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China invited China to provide Liu adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu lawyer told AFP previously that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room at the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to talk and contact.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore. Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem foolish as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Justice Minister K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports Singapore as a city should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people get a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and efforts to create this valuable land, we can say that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in view of this, he seemed invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently guided by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the core of the subject, the good old Leier comes again from the authoritarian machinations that pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, in the last week of Shanmugam, the answers given to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system were really no answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He cloaked the corresponding questions with non-responses of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our valued K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point as long as he was paid high to be part of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out regarding the criticisms that one should start reading the whole copy of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the signatures.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said Singapore is more a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "be no country," "" "he obviously does not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, which makes such a polemic statement as a leader of a growing generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice said about Singapore..." ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard that was waiting for me - whether I agree with them or not, but that is another matter.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review breaks down the weak points of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "has Mr. Shanmugam" "" "credible a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudge spokesman?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1721">If not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As it plays an important role within the Cabinet, the statements of Mr Shanmugam are of grave importance.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video, paroeing the Junta, who took power in 2014 and despite their promise to restore the civilian government, the country continues to reign.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what rules his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video is indirectly related to the ongoing military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days alone, the video loaded on Facebook was 1.254 times and got 8,800 likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, inparticular as it relates to the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has pursued in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision-making over important national issues." ""</seg>
<seg id="1790">"" "the 11th rule:" "" "change your attitude" "" "refers to the notorious program for" "" "Adjustment change" "" "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons considered by the Junta as critics." ""</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose a new unit was also set up in the army which monitors online content and persons accused of being denied the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand puts a strife against "Lese Majest" (majesty).</seg>
<seg id="1794">The war law was declared in Thailand on 20 May 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, there was a coup in the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and internet users are threatened with long sentences, they should offend the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile the song's teaser showed members of the band, who imitated the Salut from "The Hunger Games," which was already used by putsch opponents during protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>

<seg id="1815">Around 43,000 people lived in this district in 1989.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59 year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink grooved frame and gold-colored earrings in the Teddy Bears form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 Dollars per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells the people to get in full minibuses and from the top of the coast they start calling: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy drugs that they cannot pay, they massaged them with a balsam the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>

<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a builder on construction of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy grew weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave her again," "" "he replies, smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa but her guests taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house this winter.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered to them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he tells." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula comes from central America, and other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to extract money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a stranger, a remote student, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, travellers quietly consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems to be happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud Grandmother she appears in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African haircare she made her a female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users will be granted</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10th, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the communication it is said that the app" "" "prevent access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities could also use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, exchanged messages with a private e-chat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app was able to identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remote control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the minors for minors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate the home network of a person or steal from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China focus mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Media Outlet "Images from mainland China" based on Twitter, published the censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where policemen checked the inhabitants indiscriminately as to whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use appliances that are meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment through training technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China," also released a Jingwang product description, out of which the software can lift the license requirement of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang are becoming electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The prescriptions in Jingwang are possibly a response to the instructions of the city party council to minimise the dissemination of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and affiliated organisations including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current account of Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs, until August 1, their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media storage cards" at the local police register.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos. however, this action violates the rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of speech and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he turns to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and also to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine spotted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the upper floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyeen (for example: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who opposes the conservative majority and surveyed its old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and raptures.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only found in his hometown Amman Relevanz, but also in cities that go from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as a person who is not limited by limits in his thinking and can feel with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special affection against US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib regards his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war-areas, have anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian" fledged from the second generation, "he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so" "" "because of my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a person," "" "while he soldered Nescafé in water in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancestral traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sensing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the slugs speak lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent cigarette in the nose is primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"" "" "" "sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you have a look into the neighboring countries." ""</seg>
<seg id="2109">From that point, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan drinking water - to avoid land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">The Interior Ministry of Jordan has recently cancelled a performance by the Mashrou 'Leila band, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action of action - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual tribute hamed Hamed Sinno, which contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for concert cancellations.</seg>
<seg id="2112">In an interview with CNN, the Chamber of Deputies and the former spokesperson on the Islamic coalition, Dima Tahboub, said that the concert "just" was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also affirm that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which challenges the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement Mashrou 'Leila valued the Jordanian people as a "progressive supporter of human rights," which continues to be decided on an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement may not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflects an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib regained traditional gender norms by depicting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently decayed woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives by the hands of those who were supposed to trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of honorary killings took place in Jordan - the unofficial outside left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still worse that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence to provide adequate support.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the crime of crime from 1954, women who are subjected to the risk of intra-family violence can be imprisoned for indefinite time in prison, and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditures and the guarantee from the family that the woman will not do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known for not shy away from subjects that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music that is full of explicit allusions on sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I got politics incorrectly," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "", "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "ghareeb" "" "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"" "in March 2016, Hdaib published a song titled" "" "Santandano" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words," "" "what you want" "" "- be it belief or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan is talking about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been heavily censored up until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan online program Roya, to later notice that his comments from the context were torn, twisted and censored by his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ community and represents the opinion that intolerance to homosexuals does not entail Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwas, who was to work on behalf of the caliph later, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service established several former members of government and members of the faculty association, arguing that in social media commentaries expressed themselves critically to the problems associated with the deeply rooted corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">"" "" "" "in view of this, the concert hdaibs considers that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians." ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is permanent giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou 'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a real and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not through bombs, unitions and artificial democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it happens, Hdaib will carry on further and consequently also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the trolleys, drums and dancing come from a period of time, in the armies of the west of Japan, marched to the northeast to force the indigenous population of the region, the emission to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to take a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is hard to imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking forward to the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed-cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!!!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outer appearances and body care rarely were as important as in this history, as they help keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate occupation like those of the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima's capital - a region with a very high crime rate, where street smoke and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - as many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more and more regular citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts opposite each other to show who can create the most exacting looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions like the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressing for the hairdresser, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of youths have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year commencing in March, the school presented special training workshops and reported on some of their successes:</seg>

<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important, people who feel pushed out to accommodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">The young Columbian activist Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt and Cristian Palacios Foundation touched exactly this question from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letter to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement COLOC (German: Revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was deemed to be so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Colombian soldiers there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to a war rhetoric and carried out their weapons around the clock, must now re-integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take up their ranks and support them in setting up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was created on the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This stated that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he continued to share his love with people this year, who needed the most pressing response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The plan was to write letters of hope and support for former militants of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and have to build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history into a common history of peace," she says.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters have been collected in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camp in the region of Caldono-Cauca on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves as they had done it earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters of full support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">"" "it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." "" "it's unbelievable how many different feelings you can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between," "" "the politician student Manuela Jiménez Avila later told." ""</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we passed the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL Granatwerfer, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and I said to him," "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "he answered," "" "I answered a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it. "then suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of war, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices / voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some leaders of the FARC gathered for a panel discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC explained the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years, we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state has been working on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party, we can help shape society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who have never heard heard before and had no right to vote, and to recognize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former warriors have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombianans were prophesied that after the disarmament peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people willing to take up arms to rise and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those dreaming of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and make sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties ahead.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying: "here is a gift for you of your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt myself.</seg>

<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and awakened the last end of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had to get along and started crying.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stitches in my right pulmonary wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you placed - in which the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are deprecated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For that I am very thankful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he went with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd demands: some told me that I must prove it by running up without going through the streets; others wanted me to go to Grosny on the official TV and say that I didn't change my sex, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has ashamed not only your family, but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and already a few hours later a car was standing under the window with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number tags - it turned out that I was followed.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought myself a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering me without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checkout into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment, when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I received a message: "you don't believe, you'd be sure, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender inequalities, this is a taboo issue.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Cuban items I still carry within me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this mental barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera I really try to look like the person that she reminds of her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For those I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"" "" "" "I spoke to someone who has imprisoned one and a half months in argun." ""</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told us that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: an acquaintance of me says that there were not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kadywort's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know they are held there, so that they can be presented as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "if they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV, claiming they would have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply gone, but deliberately immersed in order to radicalize themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even present when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave themselves?</seg>

<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already known in very big ny, when I was still living there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, then it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia intended to lead us to the" "" "civilisation" "", "but ultimately threw us back into the stone age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the law of the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed lashes, bore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of Sharia never harms me just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, was a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechnya language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't worry about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children if they make fun of sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut their eyes closed to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never insulted me, never hunted and never smitten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this probation period hold?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began talking on television about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could sense how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had been smiling and laughed before were at once concerned with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily worse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I still work as an activist.</seg>

<seg id="2389">Do you know many think of transitions to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August was the desperate situation of the Arab Ahmadi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahh in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahnazi human rights groups who want to work and remain anonymous in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video that was filmed on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to clear the flames again, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahvaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide which happened in August within the Arab Ahmadi minority, and activists on the ground warn against the fact that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahweazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe job.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahmadi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a majority of the Arab Ahmadi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab region of Awaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy in all Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahlaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated disease, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denies the Ahmadi Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories, where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The rate of unemployment among the Ahawzi adolescents rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahmadineis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "Dohimi said that especially unemployment has become worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic and anti-Arab discrimination in the adjustment process:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahmadi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livelihood out of their native ancestor.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahmadi and be hired as even Arabic names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arab language or wearing Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahmadi must endure, human rights activists propose alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and published originally on the website Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even think well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be all feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand under strict observation, when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women encounter a glass ceiling earlier or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is known to me and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black women women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused in terms of racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "however, everyone agrees that women - all women - should come together to" "" "lift up their voices and" "" "Kumbaya to" "" "sing my Lord" "" "to achieve equal rights (some) of women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualized violence there is a institutionalised form of institutionalised violence that we are subjected to black women in a twofold way.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic and home countries deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women to have the same rights for all men, all men and all men at all. on the other hand, I can't join a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands, refusing to consider injustice in her mind, which refers to both gender and the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer have to fight for my belonging to a white-feminist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, Sojourner said in her speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in a historical sense is a menaceful and marginalised being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join the groupings, which also by cultural appropriation absorb our customs and customs so as to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer attempt to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and sex. for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to isolate themselves from white feminism, the word "Feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and to join the movement of feminism, called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana potanism: reclaiming (for example: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) speaks of defending ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces in which they can be completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which constitute the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to find out about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life has neither passed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

"" "there are various indications and reports, which do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay" "", "she explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the figures available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 ads were prosecuted for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 adverts due to domestic violence in peace courts. also here 86% of women's ads came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women said that they were physically ill-treated, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi only few of these crimes are actually shown. "to each woman who refuses ad in Paraguay because of mental abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse," "" "she explained at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the genocide in Paraguay is not a separate crime, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists included at least 12 cases of genocide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to her estimates, a woman in Paraguay dies every ten days due to violence through men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning, she didn't want to do it, but after that she was supposed to regret it forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychological force on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women who are too submissive, because they let themselves be fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had liked this so long by Carlos and did not leave him sooner.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mistreated.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Network Yo te creo ("I believe you") consisting of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimonies of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their prosperous partner eventually managed to convince them that it was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's ads in the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives, they did not receive support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against its former partner, which developed into an unpredictable juridical struggle between Paraguay and its home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of their former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016 a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# princess).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the Movement # NiUnaMinos (# Nonunity) are part of a campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">"" "" "" "the original draft of the law stipulates that Femsuicide is to be declared an independent offence and to punish harshly as is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2532">"" "" "" "so the law text was changed in some respects to also win the deputies for the law which advocated that the way for decriminalisation of abortions is generally prohibited and punished with up to five years" "" "imprisonment." ""</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was intended to pay the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence must be borne by themselves, if they simply refuses to provide notification and would like to receive a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Ikauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">"" "" "" "a rethinking must take place here, so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal." ""</seg>

<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we have to report as long as ill-treatment is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed, among other things, a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>

<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison where he is serving a one-year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and placed in court.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Since 1970, Oman is ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had deposited his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, he is the most important ministries in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces, Minister of Defence, Foreign Minister, President of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular domestic secrecy, public freedoms, including press freedom, restrictions and human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists, intimidating and detained.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>

<seg id="2566">In addition, al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a ban on public prohibition and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3000 omanic rial (7800 US dollars). moreover, a one-year vocational ban imposed on the two journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of the use of "an information net for the dissemination of material that could pose a danger to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a security deposit of 5000 omanic rial (13 000 US Dollars) was established and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Court of Appeal spoke free to Al-Abri during a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for one year and Al-Maamari.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Figure takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research on-site medical research: there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>

<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself explores the HIV virus before he decided to go back home in order to support the Serbian healthcare system.</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change world food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about possible solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 sorts, such as Outshadming, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was limited by his own imagination and the question of how many types of salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only suited for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or bevelled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or antitrust types. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food safety for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton still breeds lettuce, but now he needs longer because his work is increasingly difficult for his work.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if there were a boulder in a river, around which I must swam." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new salad, because all the characteristics are already patented. "thus, it continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement which is becoming ever greater in the US and throughout the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" trains).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red reddish salad of the "greenhouse" variety in the "greenhouse" of the station. there, it is tested to see if plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like that the movement originates from the IT department and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are therefore permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Within the framework of the initiative, called OSSI, U.S. breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy seeds, to breed it, to breed their own varieties, and not immediately send out - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patente.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects for the future</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emerified Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg are in control of the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in greater clashes such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little by brewing seeds with natural resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open-source" movement is not occupied with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically altered or not, from ecological farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says and takes care of the increasingly common mergers in the global agriculture industry, as it is offered on farmers markets, but should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to providing others their seeds freely. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is jeopardized as the available gene pool shrinks due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights of plant material, which is therefore increasingly restricted, shrinking continuously.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of OSSI, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found that about one third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only aggravated.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are no such estimates yet, but experts such as Luby believe that grown plants like wheat in even greater style are patented as lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they exhibit desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or color improves to those due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders diminishes through more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently more important than ever since the changed conditions by climate change are much worse predictive.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-Sprecherin Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company envises the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts that intellectual property advocates other breeders, as" "" "patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get to the same result using another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, it promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have already lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders do not have the time or money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to facilitate their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be made impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "Morton is bothered by the concept of patented herbal features:" "" "we do not really create the characteristics themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breed a variety also breed their own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation of mass herbicides are needed, breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that are active in international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) have patents, they create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents. either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salata in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks as if I was using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>

<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be leading in the "open source" breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly across the globe.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, introduces a "open-source" seed program. to preserve the seeds of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>

<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding vary from country to country, so the OSSI obligation cannot simply be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which permits patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">One explanation is not yet a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "open source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmer, operator of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend for patenting seed.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for "Open Source" seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for "open source" seed systems for which scheduled next year will be the official starting signal.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a link that Luby from OSSI hopes that more people will soon recognize him.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has particular attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that even more is behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest Zensur goals in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 5th August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and report them above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "August has published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic network for human rights information remains unknown despite this attack and the violation of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities, who should defend the law of defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, the Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the network of Al Jazeera on alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada does not have access to more in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up was to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider in which also Ziadas blog is located, on the other hand, it is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video, how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and human rights in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Blocking blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blocking of the blog might not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been successful for them to convey to me the feeling of a siege; an arrest, a tempted murder, summons at national security council, blocking blogs, as well as any other web page for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 sites from 24 May to 06th August. this gave technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP) including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of vendors, through the transformation of Internet censorship and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPN)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs has started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the government's intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is compounded by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can proceed against these actions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2752">Foto von: estado Maior (CML) via Fotos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in whole Brazil report with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day is assassinated a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves robbery pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temhe sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air Force to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "so the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "announced for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16, published the editorial" "" "This is not normal," "" "in which she announced a new category called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports about violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper said the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that happens from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper said that this decision is not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war of war in a country that does not recognize war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the paper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to do so, atrocities of the police which first shoots and then questioned questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "does the term" "" "war" "" "harm more than it protects?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira argues to designate violence as a "war." this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could complicate the responsibility of the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media enterprise in South America, which, as Cecília emphasises, has been repeating the country's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a favela by using a massive police unit and permanently stationing one unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this indeed led to a decrease of violent deaths. for several years, the UPP has been increasingly under bombardment after several reports of chicans and repressions against the poor communities that should protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux was quoted from one of his articles from 2010, explaining why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical for a war. this involves entering into the territory of a "enemy," with which a civilian is an unclear point in the landscape and becomes the object of "collateral damage" and "aberrant bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police killed the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: an orchard died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where chemical weapons attack the lives of hundreds of civilians on August 21st 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume the basis of the UN investigation and other human rights organisations that the Assad regime massacred.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebels inspected areas outside Damascus, which led people to rely on locally produced or tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become inaccessible to large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own fungi as a "saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and run the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi do not belong to the conventional food crops planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The director of the project, Abo Nabil, said AFP to the French news agency:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organisers, reports Global Voices that has been struggling for three years to announce this project and expressed its relief that it is now becoming more and more "well-known."</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda, use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform cando.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge to planting fungi, such as Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around €12,700, but will continue to collect donations to cando on Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Due to the shortage of fuel, locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the" "" "production of piles from the regions" "" "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms all over East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 hot outbreaks that spread in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite images, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon area.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt unprotected.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohesion pit. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a strange country with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar that were heavier than himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"" "there was no service there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we were not frozen at night." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected asylum, Asharaf returned to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high ratings. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Civil Liberties Union for Europe human rights organisation writes, the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised installations in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - what can be drawn up after the registration of the asylum request for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his inmate life-wille helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions very soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf contended his entire savings in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and fast food.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, approximately 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transition solution to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, a number of Afghan companies were created, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen personnel are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Ashark's goals reach far beyond the Italian hospitality sector and retail outlets and aim back to the country which he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where a risk is, there are also opportunities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Ashark also forges plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey herself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that sees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after a registration with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would need to be able to use the social networks within six months of a successful lawsuit on the authority's website, stating their full name and their ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who neglect this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the ensuing of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the law, which was advertised by sixty members of Parliament, is currently on the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be debated there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "may another deputy set up a legislative proposal in which harder punishments would be introduced for the insult of the President or a high officer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposal, such a deed would be punished with prisons and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, it would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he exercised Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against protesters who demonstrated against the military coup that had led the elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, as more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested for the same incident, four years in custody on a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May, because the prison management, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the accused from prison into the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatened the death penalty for one, so many human rights groups agree, false loads of inter alia weapons of arms, illegal assembly, murder and murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal tribunal opened in Giza the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for reporting on pro-Morsi seat blockade on the Raba'a Al-Adaviya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the incident previously mentioned, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists to interrogated documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was chiefly interrogated to a rocked action plan. said Plan was written by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, strongly supports a controversial bill of bill backed by businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April on the website of Nawaat throws a light on how the predictional plans to support the legal situation look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused the nomination of his sources, stating Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which criminalises journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to present their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the information offices of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need a permit before writing or sharing messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the regulations, it is also stated that registration will be required with the full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that by eliminating anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these provisions only selective in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence." ""</seg>

<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">"" "" "" "may the state censorship of Russia shut up access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat." ""</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roscomnadzor, WeChat failed to register in the state government as the "organizer of information proliferation."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law dating back to 2014, thanks to which the Russian Government carries out a list of online services that organize the publication of the information. "the law also allows the government to be responsible for removing content and forcing it on request to suspend user data.</seg>

<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services relating to the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outwardly.</seg>
