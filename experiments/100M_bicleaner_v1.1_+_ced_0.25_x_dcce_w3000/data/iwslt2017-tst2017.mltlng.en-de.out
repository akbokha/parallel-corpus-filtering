this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times rep@@ orter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , cra@@ cks wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation , in which the CIA imposed literally dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an unbelievable story .
but do you know who the chapter did not fall ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years , the government has established cra@@ cks and urged him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the pattern of the government , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to condem@@ n and spy journalists .
according to the First Constitution , the media has the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they disclose .
so when the government dropped to cra@@ cks , he did something that many brave rep@@ orters were doing before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en thus lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , only days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , even though they have been telling for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to cra@@ cks .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the rep@@ orters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of separ@@ ating and breaking up cra@@ cks , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secret his phone counter@@ parts secre@@ tly ,
as well as his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit card , and even Rei@@ sen@@ ach@@ weise with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and cra@@ cks of supposed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all U.S. governments .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work than secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional addi@@ tive because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology allows the government to handle the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
they can do that from the moment they get in contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not yet been written as cra@@ cks wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source distribution system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload or send documents , as with any contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the news agency has access .
so the government cannot secre@@ tly proc@@ ure information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outs@@ et .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se us all .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology @-@ makers such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to bring missions . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer ,
who wants to know about defici@@ encies in the supply of soldiers and want to report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental agent who strikes an alarm on the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall street insi@@ der who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the greatest data story of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and mighty &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax hav@@ ens &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents from the Panam@@ anian law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous enterprise . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax hav@@ ens .
it is said that a trace of USD 2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are nerv@@ ously waiting for the next release , and to the next unveil@@ ed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to be we@@ pt away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that happen to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that affects all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens , are used by some few to hide and obsc@@ ure their assets -- something we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these hav@@ ens function .
I always imagine it like a mat@@ r@@ yo@@ ff .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these stands .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters are .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
presum@@ ably , because there were so far no prominent Americans that were present in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle behind which these hav@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US states , you need less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed che@@ aters to rip off especially sus@@ cep@@ tible investor .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked that all up to a lawyer made suggestions on how to transfer his money .
these were all pre @-@ reviews . none of these lawyers was taking us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to it . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to not consider this as an individual case .
it is not a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investigation .
it &apos;s not about a single leader , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
this may sound very tri@@ b@@ ulation as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite clearly that things have begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen proposals for greater transparency , concerning the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has recorded in central regi@@ sters at national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US lag@@ s behind here .
representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliamentary groups , but this does not make progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally .
for us in Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that rise up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and advoc@@ ate to end this kind of transparency through laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally end the lack of transparency , which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I almost kid@@ n@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
a day after I completed my design studies , I made a back yard sale .
a guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace .
I invited him on a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he got the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; See how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock in ?
a game est@@ ran@@ de sle@@ eps in my living room .
what if he is mad ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , sne@@ aking at toe tips to the door , and my bedroom door closed .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he bought from me hang@@ s today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold to me when foreigners were foreigners , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my ro@@ omm@@ ate attracts and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it , be afraid to turn into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , plus a mattress and breakfast each morning .
Ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; Air Matt@@ ress and Breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ettes tast@@ ed completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that at the same time we could find new friends and pay our rent ?
things came into the roll .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ ach@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
thus , we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website that people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room , whose doors you are closing when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the ro@@ cket to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
nobody who is still with comfort would invest in a business , allowing stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you think about the things you can do well . we could design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the total experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design achieve something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree confidence we strive for .
it is a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left ro@@ om@@ mates .
this silent touch of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so even most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only then , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ?
could you please tell Twitter that he is the President of the President ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what , if your neigh@@ bor had first presented with his name , if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children would mean ?
imagine you would have 150 app@@ rais@@ als who all say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ lock cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to give negative jud@@ gements .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both the host and the guest had handed over their jud@@ g@@ ments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we studied how prob@@ able it is that people trust each other depending on how much they themselves are regarding age and residence .
little surprisingly we trust the people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add the call to a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
if you have fewer than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good call suff@@ ers common ground .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
furthermore , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le Art@@ works in your apartment ! I make holiday with my family . &quot;
how can I create this degree of openness with design ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics one should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards stran@@ gers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly : a need that had not been covered before .
the business is very good for us .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to party or have devast@@ ated homes .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the foref@@ ront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts if I only think of it .
the dis@@ appointment that one h@@ ears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million im@@ par@@ ted overnight stays had only one fraction of the problem .
for men trust each other rightly .
when trust works , miracles can occur .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his evaluation :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who are pr@@ one to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , although they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive your own car into the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring about books .
they can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire .
but these relations behind the pure cash transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing fit together with money transactions ?
this is an economic transaction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it simply the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing will not do justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people have a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place where you visit , a group there would be more ad@@ missible to fill a thoroughly and to show you at a Knei@@ pent@@ ine district , of which you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays homes are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we were to create apartments from the ground up to one another ?
what would this look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces belonging to the government ,
were offered residents now . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were convey@@ ed to people whose children were drawn up . inc@@ ub@@ ator programs were started ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host .
so the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality also existed before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why has our worked just ?
apart from happiness and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the ingredients of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
every time I have to think about it when a red Mazda drive past me .
of course we know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big impact , I wonder what we can use for the future .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a Beli@@ ever ? an Expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media portra@@ y people who look like me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative . &quot; &quot; &quot;
studies show : Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met one Muslims : it is great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born that way .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I decided to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were app@@ alled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you op@@ press yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : back then it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and opposite the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted passi@@ vely the faith of my parents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devot@@ ion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ ms sometimes brings me to we@@ eping .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands you , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I was sitting in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ meldung . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people j@@ umped from the buildings .
what was that ?
to have an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should one do such a thing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I switched to the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bing Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my god .
it was not only my country , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a susp@@ ect .
the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I ro@@ de -- as we heard sil@@ ently -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations who said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be alert &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be alert &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ay in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t condem@@ n you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it became Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gathered to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were kept for Muslims , locked up and struck .
there were really ra@@ inf@@ alls on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have got the anger of the people to the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly asser@@ t itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we get rid of them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only kept under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first @-@ hand and Olympics .
will the closure of mos@@ ques secure America more secure ?
there may be a few parking lots available , but do not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to more toler@@ ant people of other faith , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC area recently told me : people are actually not radi@@ c@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ c@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
when the person believes that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or beliefs .
if we want to prevent radi@@ c@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS constitutes its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
when Muslims , as a mother , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations if one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
but when one thro@@ ws a glance at them , it does not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the Scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pret@@ ended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . each cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke brought her silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injus@@ tice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger , it was a main objective for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts , which you promised a solution .
this I@@ mam restored the connection to God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways of a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia concerned me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consuming of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows : if you submit noti@@ ons of news in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they rather unanim@@ ously agree to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two periods of election .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to hollow the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it the first , but the toxic air of fear sh@@ ines all of us .
at the assignment of collective blame it is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his res@@ ume . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered them as well as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who visited the afternoon .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can ex@@ ert our religion freely .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat we ro@@ de silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , and took off my shoes , and went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me hold .
the hall was filled completely .
then the I@@ mam made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and sympathy for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who mean : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght work , working in a pos@@ h think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive myself . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims around the world and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people like an exception appear as a rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about getting a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones .
before air @-@ packages penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces .
you can also build self @-@ reli@@ ant structures .
they have learned to bear loads , deal with turbul@@ ences and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
to make a system autonomous , it must know collective notification where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the location in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest flat@@ . e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight device that tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
like other star@@ fish , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit no matter what position the optimum position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often place fundamental abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mo@@ vable parts that gather to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remot@@ ely controlled planes , which only had two mo@@ vable parts : a propeller and a h@@ edge ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flies are working with only one .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote control unit . it was invented recently .
it has only a mo@@ vable part , a propeller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and Quer@@ ru@@ der , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , in the interior life happens very much , so that it can fly steady , and move across in the room .
however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of throwing it right if all watch me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video fil@@ med yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in nau@@ sea , this machine is here , the omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result , he gets the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is fil@@ med or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some models are available in models , the rest is learned directly during flying .
let &apos;s see this .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate propeller @-@ propeller aircraft .
this turns in clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance pr@@ one .
if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if restricted .
we will demonstrate this now by making one half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took custom@@ ary micro @-@ Quad@@ copter -- each one weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine is there to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us , wages are in development and the act of creation .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to shape it in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cled each other in a very far away galax@@ y , they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy .
for this short moment they sh@@ one bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big bang .
but they did not set up their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events in a timely manner .
1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then the Earth has produced a lot of things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is standing at -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly brave -- R@@ ai Weiss of MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are formed by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them held them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation funded their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational wave observ@@ atory .
in the following years , the precision of lig@@ o could be substantially increased , which greatly improved the detection performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
beginning September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ di@@ zing black holes scre@@ wed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell from my death @-@ sick father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : that &apos;s my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist on MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a vibration in the structure of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched towards one direction and into the other .
for illustration , lectur@@ ers often lead a truly al@@ ber@@ n@@ ous dance in courses for the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; stretch and du@@ ck , stretch and du@@ ck . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and smo@@ ked at the sur@@ ging of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why one explained the lig@@ o staff for crazy .
with a five kilometer long laser det@@ ector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ ci@@ sts are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
THOR@@ NE published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming around you from several points .
in tones it is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean to you particularly :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume , in order to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , just Alice talks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob breaks them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ ummer Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot produce simple images of objects in the universe with them .
but by paying attention to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally listen to the universe .
listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes so my colleague Scott is busy for a long time .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , simply chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
the two bodies rot@@ ate very fast , you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . this sounds like W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement voc@@ abulary , im@@ printed in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s noise &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what he has to hear , recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn about as fast as the rods of your mix@@ ers .
AA : let us briefly consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space can we not see -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ous stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ ae .
they are very useful , we learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us , which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never pass through , as these are opaque .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big Bang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the urine is covered by its own night light .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , which we have never seen and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as lig@@ o they are watching , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so to say the sour no@@ oks for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o allows us a completely different perspective on the events of the universe , the gen@@ esis of the stars and ultimately on how we eman@@ ate from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as bold as possible .
through Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be ni@@ cer than to listen to the bang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say to everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it made me nervous , put me in unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to talk to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , removing my fear .
my fear , spe@@ eches hold , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a definite yes that changed my life to an unexpected way . it began with a question of my smallest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , is called all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimates &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
from then on , I try to always play with them once you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I &apos;m going , I always say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say I saved my career with my children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things out , bring you to life .

I created television . I produce television .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days of four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts that are simultaneously in production , four , 16 episo@@ des : sc@@ andal , 15 episo@@ des : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episo@@ des : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America , my TV series run after one another on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are transm@@ is@@ sions I myself created , and not only produced , so even above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who else does it ?

08.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Des@@ perate Housewives
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you with it .
I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you &apos;re managing a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a classroom , take me seriously when I talk about work to help you understand that I &apos;m not just lying on the computer and fant@@ asi@@ es , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it does not dream with a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I deep@@ en into the work there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is as I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas .
as if you set a high tone , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating , funny and disturb@@ ing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and rational . and the best thing about it is the sums .
there is such a change in me when working well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the Sum@@ m sounds like a busy street , I could go for ever on it .
many people assume , when I explain to them the Sum@@ mas , that I speak about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t you understand me wrong , that &apos;s what it does .
but the Sum@@ me -- when I began working with television production , when I began to work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
the sums are more than writing .
the sums are action and activity . the Sum@@ ma is a drug .
the sums are music . the sums are light and air .
the Sum@@ ma is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t strive other than for size .
the feeling that you can &apos;t be different than striving for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sums .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ a@@ holic .
NT@@ F &amp; C.@@ O.@@ N.@@ S. Co @-@ Star Â ®
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of premature failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sums .
I just want to tell you , I am a tit@@ anium , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make a clear one : the more successful I will , the more episo@@ des , the more over@@ winter@@ ed boundaries , the more work there is , the more things at the same time , the more I write history , the more expectations are there .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als .
I like this sum . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burnt out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are ac@@ custom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my M@@ om will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inde@@ ed , I want to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a tit@@ an .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the Sum@@ mas ceased .
the hum@@ ming of the engine stopped .
I no longer loved my work . the engine was out .
the Sum@@ mas did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I made the same things as usual : the same tit@@ an work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a tit@@ anium sle@@ eps not , does not cease , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the hum@@ ming I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ades ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ho@@ wl you , stupid author @-@ tit@@ anium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do what you &apos;re doing to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you simply love another and that gives one the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz , when you already knew the bu@@ zz , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presents me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late turn and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ m , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it does not call anyone any more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I hate it when I &apos;m tit@@ anium and my bu@@ zz whis@@ pers , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is lost , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Eis@@ köni@@ gin . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming comes back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sums , but a tot@@ em .
and now I feel like I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the Tit@@ an@@ ens@@ um , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the help of programmes and television hours and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the Sum@@ ma is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real hum@@ ming depends on the love .
the Sum@@ ma is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
the real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
real sums are ignored by the pressure of history , the tasks to be imposed , expectation and pressure .
the real hum@@ ming is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a tit@@ anium ?
it is simply love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I do this as a rule , so I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic from all gu@@ ilt .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t think of playing as I work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working as home .
this admission is painful , because what a person works better than being at home ?
well yes , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of these .
we ra@@ vel around in the garden , in front and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst bub@@ bles .
I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ ality of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever listen to playing ?
you can also do it ! always say Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you probably have right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show character .
your child is less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
and talking my teen@@ ie daughter for about 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more do not need it .
each can bring about 15 minutes a bit , even on a bad tem@@ per day !
15 minutes per piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to be done .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my oasis , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the Sum@@ mas , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I si@@ ege . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is just for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I do not work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my hum@@ ming .
the tot@@ ality of life .
the tot@@ ality of love .
the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a tit@@ anium , the trip to Jerusalem is playing .
I said Yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire still burn .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I created , the marathon that I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the other , the right sum : the tot@@ ality of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , lasting , bare and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things out , I wake you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ anen has no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues , I have every day to do with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for sure , they have heard of one of the most famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ plant a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neurolog@@ ical function is improved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells the brain in case of skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and the skull pressure increases .
to save life , it is necessary to reduce skull pressure .
sometimes you need to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue specimen is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and surroundings to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you are still aware of the biological studies that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they were slow and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Double@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ral c@@ ort@@ al cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the embry@@ onic stage , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why are they going to get us ?
we don &apos;t know .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and then mark them color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step we im@@ planted them at the t@@ apping point of the same individual .
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ plant these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we im@@ plant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Sch@@ iller we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we inserted an injury and im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells which were im@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vit@@ ro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food p@@ ellets from one tablet .
they made them very good .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the mot@@ orized Cort@@ ex in the motor@@ ic c@@ ort@@ ex area .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen to people , they spont@@ aneously re@@ covering up to some degree , just as after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the aid of plastic bra@@ ins . they recover some degree , just as with the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkeys that refres@@ hed themselves spont@@ aneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
now see , when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the rice plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can fre@@ eze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant it in humans .
I really hope I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can use it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results one has to fill about two kil@@ ograms of papers and forms to undergo this kind of studies .
BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study .
first , you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit at TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy . democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as an un@@ changeable entity .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have shown no doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy dis@@ appears with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- could not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there might be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my frequent friends who spoke to me repeatedly that democracy would be abol@@ ished if something would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mis@@ fortune , could save us democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are in common , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the topic of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction , which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin @-@ top par@@ adox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ denberg , who thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt of debt ,
but only a few realize his twin .
a mountain of un@@ used cash that , however , is too fear@@ ful to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which one could carry out the debt and also produce all the things that humanity urg@@ ently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past three months , 3.4 tril@@ lion dollars were invested in the US , England and the Eurozone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.4 tril@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money , until you compare it to the 5.@@ 1 tril@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices .
debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin @-@ tops that are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stag@@ gering wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low total economic demand , which , as in a final loop , advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors that would not invest . just like E@@ di@@ pus Father , who is out of fear , the proph@@ ecy of the or@@ acle could be true , that his son would kill him when he grows ,
invol@@ unt@@ arily the circumstances bring about that o@@ edi@@ pus k@@ ills him .
this is my shar@@ per with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; his most extravag@@ ant art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to alle@@ vi@@ ate the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy based on these conclusions .
the decision @-@ making of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they restrict the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and more decisive that they grant them the right to political participation with equal voting in questions of state interests .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not held long --
like a candle that glo@@ ws very bright , it is also quickly burnt out .
however , our present @-@ day liberal democra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately had a constitution for rulers .
for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was bor@@ dered on politics , while the economy -- thus the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our democra@@ cies there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , as the economy gradually under@@ went politics and escap@@ es it .
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because it is possible to be in the government these days , and still not in power , because the power is shifted from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it nour@@ ishes , dec@@ im@@ ated , that at the end they star@@ ve .
it is similar to the economy that has so far chann@@ eled the policy that it ow@@ es itself to itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of the corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , the total economic demand falls , and the directors of the corporations are too sc@@ ared to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism sells the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin @-@ tops , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and prosperity of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ unite the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; ret@@ ains control as in ancient Athens , aside from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position as in Ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage labour by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin apples higher , the waste of sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we must re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democra@@ ti@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ogenic hyp@@ er @-@ auto@@ cra@@ cy that lets the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
thus , the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a d@@ yst@@ opia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something similar to the society in &quot; Star Trek , &quot; in which machines serve people and humans put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Athens &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long conversations indul@@ ge in the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what does it mean , how could it look like to have this &quot; Star Trek &quot; @-@ like ut@@ opia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ opia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the company : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows from one office to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what one currently works -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and income , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
no distinction between those that belong to the companies but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but which the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin @-@ peaks .
in the sphere of global political economy , please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 biggest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos , &quot; and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund .
imagine that this fund is invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment materials are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world I describe is liber@@ ating at the same time liber@@ ating privileged people , and Mar@@ xi@@ an because it will have buried the separation of capital and work in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democra@@ tically .
thank you .
Bruno ban@@ ani PRO@@ MET@@ H@@ EU@@ S T @-@ Shirt
you write yourself in your biography as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive drop in overall economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers den@@ otes as a &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am totally mad .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t think you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you are holding from the West &apos;s point of view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I must say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resem@@ bles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to present China now , to do what the West has done in the nin@@ ete@@ enth century , sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive decay line went through the euro@@ zone and continues to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have continued to choose den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to sust@@ ain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you may be able to delay it for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
if there is a finance minister or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has not made a mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to bring our government to fall just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions that run through the euro@@ zone .
they refused to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Tro@@ ika of the len@@ ders imposed on this policy was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ oss@@ al error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the fre@@ ed forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not only have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what appears to me , it will also be as toler@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having you at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard of the most , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy had met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company at Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for sending the shows and contents to the Amazon .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can not pick any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are right on this curve .
this curve is the rating re@@ distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows receive this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows that make addi@@ cts , where after you have watched a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episo@@ des ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to prohi@@ bit &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the mean exc@@ use , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire .
so he has to make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something , so Roy &apos;s wants to risk nothing .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch everyone free of charge .
and if Amazon prints out for nothing , you are getting to , right ?
millions of viewers are watching these episo@@ des .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p over or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make an Sit@@ com via four Repub@@ lican U.S. Sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that many can &apos;t remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
approximately at the same time at another company another manager placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find these a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it somewhat different .
instead of organizing a contest , he and his team have looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the ratings they give the shows , their course , what shows they like , etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the pieces together they went a car and decided not to make an Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series over a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
you have two very competitive , data @-@ driven companies .
they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here and asks for discharge , it is prob@@ able that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 Google announced that they can predi@@ ct out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked just fine , year around year until it suddenly did not work anymore ,
and no one could tell why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data is sometimes mis@@ understood as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these errors , data conver@@ ts into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people use un@@ imagin@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy .
over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you ever have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , you disman@@ tle this problem in its parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the items together to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ plen@@ ish the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it all : our brain .
if there is something where the brain is good , it is necessary to put parts and pieces back together , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision - especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I believe Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , which they would otherwise not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all of these parts and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their choices , first of all competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired outcome .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and to not forget it , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will issue it later with a technical demo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball becomes wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end at the right end of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
