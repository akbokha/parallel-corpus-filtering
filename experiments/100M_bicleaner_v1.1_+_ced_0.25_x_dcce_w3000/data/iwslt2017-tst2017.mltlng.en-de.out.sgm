<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, cracks wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that NSA illegally listened to telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation, in which the CIA imposed literally drafts for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an unbelievable story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not fall?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years, the government has established cracks and urged him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the pattern of the government, whistleblower to condemn and spy journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitution, the media has the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they disclose.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government dropped to cracks, he did something that many brave reporters were doing before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen thus lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, even though they have been telling for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to cracks.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of separating and breaking up cracks, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have secret his phone counterparts secretly,</seg>
<seg id="21">As well as his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit card, and even Reisenachweise with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and cracks of supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary condemned more than all U.S. governments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work than secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology allows the government to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">They can do that from the moment they get in contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that has not yet been written as cracks wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source distribution system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload or send documents, as with any contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot secretly procure information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that jeopardise us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology-makers such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to bring missions. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about deficiencies in the supply of soldiers and want to report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental agent who strikes an alarm on the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall street insider who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the greatest data story of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and mighty] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous enterprise. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a trace of USD 2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are nervously waiting for the next release, and to the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be wept away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are used by some few to hide and obscure their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these havens function.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a matryoff.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these stands.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters are.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably, because there were so far no prominent Americans that were present in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it is not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their assets in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle behind which these havens function, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states, you need less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheaters to rip off especially susceptible investor.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all up to a lawyer made suggestions on how to transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all pre-reviews. none of these lawyers was taking us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to it. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to not consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigation.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single leader, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very tribulation as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing has ever changed; as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite clearly that things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen proposals for greater transparency, concerning the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has recorded in central registers at national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lags behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliamentary groups, but this does not make progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us in Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy that rise up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and advocate to end this kind of transparency through laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together, we can finally end the lack of transparency, which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">A day after I completed my design studies, I made a back yard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. after that he would go to the corps of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he got the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "See how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what did I rock in?</seg>
<seg id="114">A game estrande sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, sneaking at toe tips to the door, and my bedroom door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me when foreigners were foreigners, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate attracts and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it, be afraid to turn into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, plus a mattress and breakfast each morning.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "Air Mattress and Breakfast" [Airbed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelettes tasted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I started.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that at the same time we could find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Bleachczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus, we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website that people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room, whose doors you are closing when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "that will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still with comfort would invest in a business, allowing strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you think about the things you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design achieve something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree confidence we strive for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30 seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlocked mobile phone to your left roommates.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent touch of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So even most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only then, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell Twitter that he is the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What, if your neighbor had first presented with his name, if he had told where he came from, how his dog or his children would mean?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 appraisals who all say: "he can really hold very well unlock cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both the host and the guest had handed over their judgments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we studied how probable it is that people trust each other depending on how much they themselves are regarding age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add the call to a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have fewer than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good call suffers common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Furthermore, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, such as" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, such as "Tolle Artworks in your apartment! I make holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create this degree of openness with design?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics one should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to party or have devastated homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts if I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million imparted overnight stays had only one fraction of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, miracles can occur.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his evaluation:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, although they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive your own car into the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring about books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay will expire.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure cash transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing fit together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic transaction.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but to call it simply the" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing will not do justice." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People have a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place where you visit, a group there would be more admissible to fill a thoroughly and to show you at a Kneipentine district, of which you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays homes are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we were to create apartments from the ground up to one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thought of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered residents now. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were drawn up. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has our worked just?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the ingredients of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">Every time I have to think about it when a red Mazda drive past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this big impact, I wonder what we can use for the future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A Believer? an Expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media portray people who look like me.</seg>

<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I was sitting in my kitchen, had breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word "Eilmeldung."</seg>

<seg id="301">It was not only my country, but in the Nu the actions of others turned me into a suspect.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I rode -- as we heard silently -- so deep it went into my seat, and I feared the first time to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>

<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>

<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only kept under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first-hand and Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques secure America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking lots available, but do not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerant people of other faith, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington, DC area recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When the person believes that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS constitutes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">When Muslims, as a mother, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But when one throws a glance at them, it does not drive what they read in their "Holy Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. each clergy with whom she spoke brought her silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger, it was a main objective for the instrumentalization by extremists, which you promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways of a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia concerned me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consuming of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows: if you submit notions of news in which negative about Muslims have been reported, they rather unanimously agree to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two periods of election.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to hollow the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it the first, but the toxic air of fear shines all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">At the assignment of collective blame it is not only about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his resume. she was astonished and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is such an accomplished young man from my brother?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exert our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat we rode silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and took off my shoes, and went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me hold.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was filled completely.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and sympathy for panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might claim that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught work, working in a posh think tank, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't deceive myself. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at Muslims around the world and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people like an exception appear as a rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: many thanks. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about getting a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-packages penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-reliant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear loads, deal with turbulences and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">To make a system autonomous, it must know collective notification where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the location in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest flat. e.g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starfish, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can float, and thus has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit no matter what position the optimum position is regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often place fundamental abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that gather to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled planes, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a hedge rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies are working with only one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote control unit. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and Querruder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, in the interior life happens very much, so that it can fly steady, and move across in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right if all watch me is low, so I'll show you a video filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in nausea, this machine is here, the omnibus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he gets the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is filmed or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some models are available in models, the rest is learned directly during flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see this.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate propeller-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance prone.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now by making one half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took customary micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine is there to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, wages are in development and the act of creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to shape it in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far away galaxy, they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they shone brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set up their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the Earth has produced a lot of things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is standing at -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave -- Rai Weiss of MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are formed by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation funded their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer gravitational wave observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following years, the precision of ligo could be substantially increased, which greatly improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">Beginning September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collidizing black holes screwed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: that's my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a vibration in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched towards one direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers often lead a truly albernous dance in courses for the theory of relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and duck, stretch and duck."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and smoked at the surging of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1. that's why one explained the ligo staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">THORNE published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean to you particularly:</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume, in order to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now, just Alice talks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob breaks them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "dummer Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce simple images of objects in the universe with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally listen to the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to the gravitation can tell us about the collision of two black holes so my colleague Scott is busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, simply chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">The two bodies rotate very fast, you hear the same circus with an additional key change. this sounds like Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender's noise] Somebody who knows what he has to hear, recognize this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which turn about as fast as the rods of your mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us briefly consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe, as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space can we not see -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserous stars explode in super novae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful, we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus, which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through, as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the urine is covered by its own night light.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, which we have never seen and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as ligo they are watching, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to say the sour nooks for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us a completely different perspective on the events of the universe, the genesis of the stars and ultimately on how we emanate from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Through Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say to everything" "" "Yes!" "" "before I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Whether it made me nervous, put me in unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to talk to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, removing my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches hold, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "my life has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that changed my life to an unexpected way. it began with a question of my smallest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, is called all" "" "estimates" "", "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>

<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">From then on, I try to always play with them once you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, I always say Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>

<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">08.11.2015 | Desperate Housewives</seg>
<seg id="584">I created television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days of four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts that are simultaneously in production, four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run after one another on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are transmissions I myself created, and not only produced, so even above. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="599">08.11.2015 | Desperate Housewives</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you're managing a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a classroom, take me seriously when I talk about work to help you understand that I'm not just lying on the computer and fantasies, and it's true when I say: I understand that it does not dream with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I deepen into the work there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you set a high tone, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and exhilarating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and rational. and the best thing about it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the Summ sounds like a busy street, I could go for ever on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, when I explain to them the Summas, that I speak about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't you understand me wrong, that's what it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the Summe -- when I began working with television production, when I began to work and work, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. the Summa is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums are music. the sums are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The Summa is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can't strive other than for size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that you can't be different than striving for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">NTF & C.O.N.S. Co-Star Â ®</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of premature failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a titanium, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear one: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more overwintered boundaries, the more work there is, the more things at the same time, the more I write history, the more expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the totals, the totals, the totals.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single job.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my Mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "Indeed, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a titan.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the Summas ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I no longer loved my work. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Summas did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as usual: the same titan work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium sleeps not, does not cease, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the humming I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "howl you, stupid author-titanium." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do what you're doing to be a teacher, a banker to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you simply love another and that gives one the buzz when you know the buzz, when you already knew the buzz, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern waitress" "" "presents me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late turn and she says:" "" "mom, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me" "" "estimate." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "it does not call anyone any more" "" "estimate" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I hate it when I'm titanium and my buzz whispers, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sum, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky finger and humid kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is lost, or whatever the girl in "Die Eiskönigin."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a totem.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums of work, the Titanensum, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the help of programmes and television hours and how functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The Summa is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real humming depends on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The Summa is the stream that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real sums are ignored by the pressure of history, the tasks to be imposed, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real humming is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so I can free myself as a workaholic from all guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the humming again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't think of playing as I work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person works better than being at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of these.</seg>
<seg id="731">We ravel around in the garden, in front and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel overwhelmingly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totality of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever listen to playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naïve, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child is less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking my teenie daughter for about 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can bring about 15 minutes a bit, even on a bad temper day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes per piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to be done.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my oasis, my world. they don't have to be the children. it is necessary to feel the Summas, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "in order to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>

<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "is just for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sum, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my humming.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totality of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totality of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">I'm sorry I'm a Titan. I've never seen a titanium, the trip to Jerusalem is playing.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children are.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I created, the marathon that I run, the troops, the canvases, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the other, the right sum: the totality of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, lasting, bare and new feeling of life in me is wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I think things out, I wake you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>

<seg id="793">Titanen has no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have every day to do with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"" "for sure, they have heard of one of the most famous" "" "deep brain stimulation" "". "in doing so, one implant a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved." ""</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain swells the brain in case of skull-brain trauma and the skull pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, it is necessary to reduce skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you need to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue specimen is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you are still aware of the biological studies that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slow and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortal cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the embryonic stage, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they going to get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them at the tapping point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call autologous transplantation -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implant these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Schiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we inserted an injury and implanted exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells which were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motorized Cortex in the motoric cortex area.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously recovering up to some degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the aid of plastic brains. they recover some degree, just as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkeys that refreshed themselves spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see, when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the rice plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can use it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to undergo this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First, you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit at TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy. democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as an unchangeable entity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have shown no doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy disappears with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made unequivocally clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- could not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my frequent friends who spoke to me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if something would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a misfortune, could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies are in common, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction, which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin-top paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg, who throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few realize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash that, however, is too fearful to invest there where it would be productive and income, with which one could carry out the debt and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past three months, 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in the US, England and the Eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money, until you compare it to the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to inflate the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Debts and unproductive capital form the twin-tops that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are staggering wages, more than a quarter of 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low total economic demand, which, as in a final loop, advocates the pessimism of investors that would not invest. just like Edipus Father, who is out of fear, the prophecy of the oracle could be true, that his son would kill him when he grows,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily the circumstances bring about that oedipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my sharper with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "his most extravagant art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to alleviate the significance of the Athenian democracy based on these conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision-making of the Athenian democracy was and is that they restrict the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and more decisive that they grant them the right to political participation with equal voting in questions of state interests.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that glows very bright, it is also quickly burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present-day liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately had a constitution for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was bordered on politics, while the economy -- thus the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our democracies there has been a relentless struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, as the economy gradually underwent politics and escapes it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because it is possible to be in the government these days, and still not in power, because the power is shifted from politics to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals from which it nourishes, decimated, that at the end they starve.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has so far channeled the policy that it owes itself to itself by the self-created economic crisis. the power of the corporations grows, political goods are devalued, the total economic demand falls, and the directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism sells the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin-tops, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to reunite the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" retains control as in ancient Athens, aside from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in Ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage labour by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin apples higher, the waste of sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathogenic hyper-autocracy that lets the film "matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">Thus, the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a dystopia, similar to that in "matrix," or by something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines serve people and humans put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athens "Agora," in long conversations indulge in the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what does it mean, how could it look like to have this "Star Trek "-like utopia rather than the" matrix "similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows from one office to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what one currently works -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and income, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those that belong to the companies but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but which the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin-peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the sphere of global political economy, please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 biggest emerging countries], in the interest of all of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos," and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment materials are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially against the backdrop of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is liberating at the same time liberating privileged people, and Marxian because it will have buried the separation of capital and work in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno banani PROMETHEUS T-Shirt</seg>
<seg id="980">You write yourself in your biography as a libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive drop in overall economic demand, which Larry Summers denotes as a "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am totally mad.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't think you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you are holding from the West's point of view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I must say so provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can now observe in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To present China now, to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suspected that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely to say goodbye to the complacency and the permanent denial that a massive decay line went through the eurozone and continues to massively threaten the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, have continued to choose denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to sustain an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, you may be able to delay it for a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or any minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has not made a mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government to fall just because they didn't want to deal with the distortions that run through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They refused to admit that they had been a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "there is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the Troika of the lenders imposed on this policy was:" "" "this was a colossal error." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if it does not survive, the freed forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not only have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post-modern 1930, what appears to me, it will also be as tolerable for the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for having you at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard of the most, although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy had met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company at Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, technology, tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for sending the shows and contents to the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can not pick any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating redistribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows receive this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad" "", "" "" "The Wire" "", "" "" "The Wire" "" "-- all the shows that make addicts, where after you have watched a season, your brain asks:" "" "where are there more of these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to prohibit "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the mean excuse, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon is doing something, so Roy's wants to risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch everyone free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon prints out for nothing, you are getting to, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skip over or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make an Sitcom via four Republican U.S. Senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that many can't remember this show because it wasn't so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Approximately at the same time at another company another manager placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find these a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it somewhat different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a contest, he and his team have looked at the available data on the Netflix viewers, so the ratings they give the shows, their course, what shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the pieces together they went a car and decided not to make an Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series over a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "yes," "" "House of Cards" "". "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">You have two very competitive, data-driven companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then it is a bit scary because we live in a time in which we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here and asks for discharge, it is probable that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that they can predict outbreaks of flu, the bad way -- through data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just fine, year around year until it suddenly did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could tell why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data is sometimes misunderstood as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data converts into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, you dismantle this problem in its parts, so that you can analyze the items; as a second, put the items together to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to replenish the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something where the brain is good, it is necessary to put parts and pieces back together, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision - especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I believe Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, which they would otherwise not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all of these parts and make a show like "House of Cards" was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their choices, first of all competing for TV ideas, then selecting "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and to not forget it, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">"" "" "" "I will issue it later with a technical demo." ""</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball becomes wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
