Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is now dig@@ ged for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
Klein@@ g@@ är@@ tner farm the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows who had to get exciting times because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green me@@ adow instead of a b@@ yp@@ ass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but that is precisely why it is very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Münchner Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
in the big picture postcard , more detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blätter , were incorporated for cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian sur@@ vey@@ ing management between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and origin@@ ating from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army officer occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops were finally depri@@ ved of the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9th February 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighbours , who created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bavarian Map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ele@@ ctor Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ verwaltung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison before / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub @-@ mail which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was dra@@ fted , so 1877 , in the city of Munich .
today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Lower Saxony are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian Pe@@ as@@ ants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing as fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming it appears a small @-@ piece card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; primitive recording &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots there are no more farmers there - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ platz of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact a me@@ adow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of the current district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; on the Gast@@ eig &quot; or &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at Au@@ er@@ feld@@ way people once locked people with ins@@ anity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based district &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard of Gud@@ d led the institution - that psychiat@@ rist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the factory in Haar , 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 .
on the grounds of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet in the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training establishments .
West is the football field of the T@@ SV München Ost , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was erected in architectural reference to the source of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ bing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Marien@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the name of Kauf@@ inger was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a sal@@ ute chapel from the Middle Ages were once held at the Mari@@ enhof , where this day will take place and on April 5 , 2017 , the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn regular route takes place .
with the sli@@ ders the old Munich @-@ map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil Rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publ@@ ishes the travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot;
the National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Committee for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which should enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based inci@@ dents are present in the whole state and be noted here , &quot; stated in the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as enforcement authorities of the state , which are disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately target@@ ing minorities , promp@@ ted the group to release the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that people pass . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
the group cited inci@@ dents like ra@@ cial off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the voyage and was taken in cust@@ ody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General , where it is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring che@@ wing money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s hate crime report , which ranks the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had adopted immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further ra@@ cial profil@@ ing .
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but l@@ ately interest groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States .
fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the C@@ DU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have taken a picture on site .
at the right gra@@ vey@@ ard of the Schwen@@ demann family , representatives of the C@@ DU local association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties .
first of all , Markus Schwen@@ demann gives insights into his business , in which he cultiv@@ ates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many juven@@ iles stored and accommod@@ ated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative market for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ ste is exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also the BL@@ HV chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot generate profit on such steep areas .
the green area provides a lot of work , much needed to be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it does not lead a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hect@@ are the farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the re@@ for@@ est@@ ation of the areas could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they can continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised because of their support
over the fence , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants in 2013 .
the storage area therefore amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 2023 .
half of the total cost of 71 500 Euros was promoted by leader , a quarter of which contributed to the community of fishermen .
thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of soft fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiss stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best foods are produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conserv@@ ation Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of soft f@@ ences .
the goal is to open the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
moreover , the enclosed area should not be to@@ g@@ able ( slope increase over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the for@@ est@@ ation .
for the 2018 F@@ ishing Project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els is currently running , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence .
the area of disclosure corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller acc@@ uses not the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ors would have loved him if he had done it .
but he embra@@ ced its significance , and in particular the importance that was attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom which illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the contemporary response to the sho@@ cking words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite some old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your po@@ thol@@ es , your poor , / your oppressed masses , which y@@ earn to breathe free , the burning waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the USA .
this conflict , because of the importance of a statue , is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who advoc@@ ated to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by portra@@ ying the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical depic@@ tion .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bapti@@ st for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty will not invite anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , which brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch is not supposed to illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh hit here on something .
the significance of the statue is entirely a matter of perception of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ usive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge .
their tor@@ ch is not supposed to ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
Director General of the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship cad@@ res will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special developed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are Med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
their captain speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete at their fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says it &apos;s &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Scottish players are in the UK team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ h@@ anger Mu@@ ir leads on this road and last year has set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should watch after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champion@@ ships than the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the team captain says she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also join the medals and fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; being so special about this team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me , it makes something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb on platforms .
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from being at the Olympiastadion again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics about Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the papers struck him for all , from domestic politics to its political principles .
he sm@@ iled with the criticism , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Hog@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of doing so at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismis@@ sed the complaint as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction to &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like Hog@@ an .
this is a Repub@@ lican Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Hog@@ an is not a reactionary chicken head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ age of persons who come to the govern@@ ors &quot; side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid by public money dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Spre@@ cher@@ in Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ ll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ie @-@ filled people who play the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by Hog@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ ll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans of Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other latest news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary volume &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject , and some are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the governor called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attack would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical clo@@ ak labels and to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but this is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Hog@@ an is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell in Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. Cach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ ent@@ u@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ LU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable por@@ to had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters sho@@ ok his lead .
and even back then Washington had anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s .
the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that settled Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project .
but he did not put them into silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which last year led to the Arch@@ er@@ field Left to the final round before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is an eager supporters of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I haven &apos;t been able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to his home ground .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how much has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less pul@@ mon@@ ary canc@@ ers by passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are attri@@ but@@ able to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said teacher Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue of 1994 .
at that time there have been 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lie to some extent in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the agriturismo Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
the traffic , which continually hin@@ ders the construction work , represents a major problem for the part ru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of motor@@ ists against red lights and barriers is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold@@ country
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai government in the rest@@ less Indon@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called a &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the stolen tu@@ ber is taken and dev@@ oured with free@@ zing , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband had not assigned her fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were supposed to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence from the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , while the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea en@@ vis@@ aged the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as seclu@@ ded as it is . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transportation .
the town with about 19,@@ 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and from cor@@ rug@@ ated roofs that have been converted by r@@ ust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not ac@@ custom@@ ed to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand @-@ woven Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to have only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esi@@ ans Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort won $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a sti@@ cking presence .
an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to one officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten those golden go@@ ans and are mer@@ cil@@ essly treated .
according to information from activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 , tor@@ tured and imprison@@ ed .
Mass@@ ent@@ ö@@ tungen in Pap@@ u@@ as Stamm@@ es@@ hoch@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s were in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in a report by the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ b@@ ane from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are contained , such as in@@ legislative exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular - and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week inci@@ dents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bolts have intensi@@ fied as Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development changes since Muslim economic migrants come from the population @-@ rich islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ anese war@@ den cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are struggling to keep up with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants have started to sell chi@@ ck@@ ens and vegetables in the traditional market to the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the indigenous Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indon@@ esian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jo@@ ko@@ wi , promised the ine@@ qualities and violations in Pap@@ ua during his 2014 election campaign .
the former carp@@ enter 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua little has changed , and today the nati@@ ves feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jo@@ ko@@ wi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jo@@ ko@@ wis inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them they were to turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers hit their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , h@@ unted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby governmental commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children assembled on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial h@@ unter @-@ holes and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle running constantly and a bird @-@ song im@@ itation - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones at police and military post .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official TIME document not released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat of danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; he said TIME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his multic@@ ol@@ oured wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired up , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just bears a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TIME in glo@@ omy mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station only because they are attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came only the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , Jo@@ ko@@ wi in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to tackle the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in October 2016 that he unanim@@ ously advised an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights ab@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses started almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto did a retreat when he spoke to TIME on June 5th and said he did not plan to establish a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , charged with the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crime against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody national vote , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims met such alle@@ g@@ ations with gri@@ m incre@@ dul@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed for four times over the last three years , but there was no progress whatsoever , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear of years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us reiter@@ ated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the found@@ ries have not ceased .
on Tuesday , the Indon@@ esian police fired vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , which refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others died , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he was fishing in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by fir@@ ing warning shots .
but local people say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian par@@ am@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered , so the TIME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai @-@ Parliament has called to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an issue of trouble for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribe of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army which claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by viol@@ ating spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ apping of Indon@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ die Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in cust@@ ody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as far away .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to work on four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ a tast@@ ed only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the leader of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribe .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
furthermore , restrictions of reporting of international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ champ were dep@@ orted because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permit was given to fil@@ ming .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jo@@ ko@@ WI@@ s campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian State Department Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the Group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia still is a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to hide the evidence for human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him to &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua will probably not be able to vote for Jo@@ ko@@ wi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ko@@ wi is a person who has good intentions but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sh@@ ut@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Executive Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants Jo@@ ko@@ wi to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a rob@@ ber military , is in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for yo@@ ko@@ wi as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ers made a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of an victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with direct head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire captured the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ r@@ atz@@ er from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is random@@ ly called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident who called his name as George attacked Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were ext@@ ingu@@ ished at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions concerning the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from facing , outer lining for decoration or insulation .
in Britain the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and facing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his big Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the two @-@ thirds majority supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup sing@@ les , was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but also therefore very much valued five @-@ set classic remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member states voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the whole package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
not only for the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had already come to leave the final at a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the following year .
in order to reduce the cost of the organizers , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in terms of training kits , etc . and players will have to pass fewer official media outlets before the Davis Cup .

the company said it was asking travellers around the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gling goods would have brought through airport security and how many would have done inten@@ tionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gled - kno@@ w@@ ingly or unk@@ now@@ ingly - carry through security , those who are most often flying .
however , the company suggests that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure about which liquids they can take with or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids taken by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while the people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to have the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has so far been propos@@ ing that some of the customers have already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed another , less glossy number for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in the past few months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500@@ .000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .
now Mus@@ k was admitted : from the total of 5@@ 18,@@ 000 pre @-@ orders 63@@ .000 had already been with@@ drawn .
critics had repeatedly pointed out that there are only non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the U.S. 1000 US Dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reservation Pay@@ out &quot; fully back .
currently , 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , that the cancellation of about twelve per cent of all orders could become a problem , however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe .
its arguments : the challenge of the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 84@@ .000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2018 is expected - all models have to be combined - 500@@ ,000 , a million by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently available per day .
who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be delivered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 at the earliest when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never @-@ tested production lines in practice without any major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if there are major delays , the obligation of the reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in flo@@ cks .
EPA conductor P@@ ru@@ itt reti@@ res because of the postpon@@ ements of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
a day after he had been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the environmental protection authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency turned out to respond more quickly to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administ@@ rations .
he did not mention the complaint raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of App@@ eals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a term that ran for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt told in June that he would delay the compliance with one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was Chief Prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of tough@@ er environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly walked out to block or delay regulations , which resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regular roll@@ back agenda &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eal in Washington has decided that the EPA car@@ et@@ aker has crossed his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ cks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards was simply the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the States by the complex process of timely ful@@ fillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administ@@ rations , the EPA has often failed to fulfill the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting to be accused by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to determine the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority we give us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority for delay and all other legally available enforcement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on sound politics and the best available information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive re @-@ version of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York general state attor@@ ney Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who had led the coalition of the states , who had lam@@ ented the EPA this week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their congreg@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont , Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ o@@ zone occurs when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight in the atmosphere .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturb@@ ing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental poll@@ ut@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery are@@ al in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16th , at 16.@@ 30 .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius site is a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the Six@@ th Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors tum@@ ours to their concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Martini emphas@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in written documents : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church on it with the V@@ og@@ t@@ ei &quot; on Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ our mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a mar@@ vel@@ ous farm , to which the church or the patron saint was right and not vice versa .
so there were people there .
as emerg@@ es from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which today are still recogni@@ zable in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement centre of the village .
old maps dating from the period around 1600 under@@ pin this historical situation .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval property law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied himself with a pastor , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
in doing so , the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Lar@@ gest of the two are bar@@ b@@ bled at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were inserted and the bell components were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops moved near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remn@@ ants of the church threatened 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the deaths of listen@@ ers .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ary Church broke off .
only the church tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 , a storm broke the church tower and the half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was ab@@ orted .
only the tower existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em tend to cultivate the Hil@@ arius system from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creative reti@@ re@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as organizers we invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery at St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is made by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with words from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Matt@@ eis .
local subur@@ b Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is at 3.30 pm .
to the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the gra@@ vey@@ ard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers take out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and listen@@ ers .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to test author@@ isation of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim hon@@ ors itself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not have a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the Land@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim is wor@@ shi@@ ped &quot; by the Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( C@@ DU ) to take back his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind force concentration zone in Vier@@ sen .
in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the remaining urban area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are intended to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve Düsseldorf because of a fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal prerequis@@ ites , the granted approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , President of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up @-@ to @-@ date state of affairs : the City Council once again resolved the wind concentration zone in Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding writings have been in the circle of Vier@@ sen for the past week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to examine the matter ane@@ w .
but they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to ongoing proceedings at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim ev@@ ehrt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a NEW subsidiary , plans to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen took part in cash , closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ sen@@ er households .
the NEW Re will invest around € 20 million .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded .
two more people were easily injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .

&quot; &quot; &quot; city and dealer plan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekend &quot; &quot; &quot;
bad Langen@@ sal@@ is and people from the region are supposed to explore the shops in the city centre in September .
the business association and the municipal authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the shopping stroll into the city centre .
as the chairman of the Gewerbe@@ verein , Christian König , announced the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend to sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers , which offers its own city apart from the usual supermarket @-@ goods .
according to the plan , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local firms should present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mid@@ night Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags which point to the action weekend , so Christian König .
the municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus , the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive downtown . &quot;
this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; Active Tag &quot; to the well @-@ being , together with sal@@ es@@ plan@@ ed Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ people and hosts to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the reno@@ un@@ cement of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potenti@@ als are to be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost sight of the city center when shopping .
in the end all would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and associations .
it used to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly broad@@ ly made , king said in spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , Head of the Chamber of Commerce in Mühl@@ hausen , informed that the first five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities will participate in the nation &apos;s third &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; day .
besides Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and make it stronger for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchasing behaviour .

tr@@ ump used after en@@ su@@ ed tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump asked in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US president insul@@ ted him because he publicly den@@ oun@@ ced the wall . report@@ edly , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Turn@@ bull said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the United States , who emig@@ rated to Australia , was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after having proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists perform ra@@ cial Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury sail@@ ed through a group of spectators in the country of Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ ank to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , had reached the bridge , a group of white men with ri@@ fl@@ es emerged to block its path .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle age man - took a long train at his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ screen .
inside they ho@@ ver@@ ed the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es t@@ ore the silence as a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
luck@@ ily this horri@@ ble scene , played on July 22 , is only a post@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is tos@@ sed , almost all of them in the audience beat very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens &apos; rights to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been syn@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was charged with the kill@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ concei@@ vable that in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congreg@@ ations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps the organization of post@@ ures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ sman of the State of Georgia and a lifetime citizen .
for him , the post@@ ure serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injus@@ tice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor puts a blank@@ et on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding county coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one ever was indi@@ cted .
although the susp@@ ects remain open for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black people to vote in Georgia for the first time to vote for their vote in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election stab@@ bed according to the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ant Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - supp@@ os@@ edly for a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that sm@@ ells in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from jail , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they approached the prison and approached the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclu@@ des a F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspi@@ racy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and obsc@@ ures the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an election law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual post of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de for nearly a decade .
their representation is illu@@ stra@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant and founded in a sort of deep rac@@ ism , of which many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch and look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with the ug@@ ly in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors crowded - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the black - into a room and no@@ isy as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played survey of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the leader cl@@ an member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actors Dar@@ ling Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , tried their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cri@@ es and ur@@ ges him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fire is disgu@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think white people then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was we@@ ather@@ ed one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp@@ ly and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
there are cri@@ es , shots and then silence .
a woman clo@@ thed with a mour@@ ning dress stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ning lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
their voice breaks every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators got sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost ev@@ enly split between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just down the road .
they have lived almost eight hours at Georgi@@ as pushing dam@@ p when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .
when the last notes of the song are sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name .
children squ@@ at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a young boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene wants to thank the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope away and wi@@ pe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man who played the cl@@ an member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks up in her arms we@@ eping , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience collabor@@ ates with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair from Atlanta talks about the post@@ ure with a black pair that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ under@@ sky was struggling to find words , which feeling the performance left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone keeps Broo@@ ks &apos;s court on his table , he e@@ ats and reminds on the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ ure is in some way inspiring , because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we do not learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not study his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging on a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows optionally a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with a laying and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; c@@ aste and c@@ aste &quot; logo of G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that an open Mercedes classic car park in which the Rhine kill@@ ers pose as a rock grab , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acked o@@ aks remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - which pul@@ ls itself through its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three Rhein@@ tö@@ chter - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ise like already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;

Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully fi@@ deli@@ ble Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he strikes Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) will have to believe it .
the audience thanks to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
in a stor@@ my way , Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ du@@ ctor Jan@@ owski are celebrated .
great appl@@ ause is available for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to leave a hil@@ ly whi@@ stling concert over himself , five years later he gave great rejo@@ icing in which the scattered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls fell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to rejoice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the dpa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also has grown an understanding of its view .
I prefer a positive conclusion .
max Menge Speci@@ fies as Vol@@ unte@@ er
they work in a volunteer year right at several places .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked at school in the open day @-@ to @-@ day .
how are your experiences with it ?
crowd : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide range that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a bel@@ ated volunteer .
how come that ?
crowd : I have made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
and then a building engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broke off .
I recognized for myself that it is a fal@@ seh@@ ood for me and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
make a social year , there is an insight , as you can see how it is on site , at the focus maybe also , really .
and was it so ?
crowd : I collected some great impressions .
I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester .
I will study dual study , probably make a social worker training in Jugen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ unte@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you make your FS@@ Y .
it is possible to make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was partly in the O@@ GS , so in the after@@ math .
for me it was the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .

one always has other people &apos;s head , each of which has a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just like that .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve the business
the UK education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome pressure with which the company is faced .
the job breakdown , General Director John Fall@@ on , mainly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , is in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May in a third cost reduction programme , Pear@@ son announced a cost reduction plan for additional 300 million pounds ( 39@@ 4 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business which was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ b@@ ings
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter had been injured , divided a declaration of NATO .
according to confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of N@@ ato it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital at the airport B@@ agram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby B@@ agram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1.6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops th@@ ron@@ ged the Taliban from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in Kab@@ ul the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policy and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule following complaints
the U.S. environmental protection authority has a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aling that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this happened a day after 15 states lam@@ ented the agency because of the cr@@ ot@@ ch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced its decision late on Wednesday to promote the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said they show the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA in June to assess the o@@ zone regulations , in which in a part of the country , poll@@ ut@@ ants should be measured in order to establish where inc@@ isions must be made to delay stri@@ c@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental issues that former President Barack Obama has imposed as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have caused the set@@ backs of demo@@ crats and nature reserves who are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website states that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gemein@@ der@@ at wants common room
at the end , the decision was clear : in two oppos@@ ing voices the common share of flu@@ orn Win@@ zeln decides the establishment of a community room in the future retirement residence .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the remaining part of the property was signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take until the area of the church has so far remained in the community property , there is now no plan of planning for the project coming from a private investor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a discussion about a community room for this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Council are suspended , such a community space is not to be seen as a meeting point only for residents of sen@@ ti@@ ent dwelling , but openly into the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget already last autumn , will be disp@@ at@@ ched by funding opportunities .
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a joint space would be , so reports T@@ j@@ aden , capable of handling 60 percent of 30 percent .
the resolution can be seen to signal the investor that in this respect , there is no short@@ age between legs , the finding that both saddle - what is le@@ aning on the surrounding environment - as well as pitch roof - which reduces the height and makes the building more economical - if possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wilfried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the body .
it is not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela Ruf points to the many own buildings that are not so easy to move forward , but they are now in the common room from the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m struggling with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
it sees behind it a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy of already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the area one does not give a grant , but rather get a real counter@@ part market@@ able in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s motion to accept the resolution appropri@@ ately finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two oppos@@ ing votes at the original program that summar@@ izes Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we hold the decision , we make a huge step in closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : cycl@@ ist is thrown on the road
while crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured .
as the police said , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Langen@@ felder was on the bike path of the street Schwar@@ zer Weg in the direction of Hil@@ den .
the Senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the street Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver driving in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Langen@@ felder went on the road , he obviously did not heed the opposite .
he met with a car , which controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered serious injury and was brought to a hospital with a retreat cart .
FC Bayern Munich has to do without Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the play against Dortmund .
with personnel care , the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund on the first mandatory play of the new season .
seven pro@@ s are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 a.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , personnel will always get bigger at Po@@ kal@@ sieger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must ab@@ stain from David Al@@ aba with the BV@@ B .
this confirmed the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
in addition , the Mün@@ ch@@ nern manages Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at .
An@@ cel@@ otti was responsible for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests . An@@ cel@@ otti was responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti said and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , it was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory play of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play smart , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans in their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 viewers , the Deutsche Fußball League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
in the Harz Mountains w@@ ander to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Harz , the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is supposed to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ war@@ te Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a planet of planets is available in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ster@@ nen@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ hi@@ kers , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase of up to 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ achiev@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ quiry boxes St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the tablets should be supple@@ mented by the internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .
even accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
later , the star @-@ path should be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of knowledge , such as the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star more light than another , although it would be much further away .
also , in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see .
since 2014 , the association operates in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for natural protection , the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ m@@ eda Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt , there have been something similar to Plan@@ eten@@ weg since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen , an initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet leads up with its stel@@ ae up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( commun@@ e ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the P@@ lu@@ to , degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf @-@ planets at the end point - are accurately positioned at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away , measuring 70 centimet@@ res .
the total distance of the planet is about four kilometers .
while the light from sun to the P@@ lu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with P@@ lu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are thus faster than the light in the cos@@ mos .
the march to the next fixed star would last for half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Box@@ ing Council lightweight Champion who went down to the cor@@ ridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , World Box@@ ing Organization super @-@ fe@@ ather@@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Br@@ oner on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
Gar@@ cia pushed the right hand and said , &quot; How are you , Champion ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the pair was pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down would be the &quot; perfect order &quot; between the fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I climb@@ ed up for Br@@ oner &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down on lightweight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this demand the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
08.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Des@@ perate Housewives
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
Klim@@ as asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that must fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following its lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he estimates Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he was thinking of seeing the tri@@ athlon champion from River@@ side &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to be co @-@ off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show stroke , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that was built for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Lom@@ ach@@ enko : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four Ver@@ los@@ ed after Tire L@@ etter
during an accident on the A7 , four people were injured in part badly on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost their control over his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in front of the junction .
the car slo@@ wed to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green strip .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were badly injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was closed to the north for about one hour , afterwards the traffic on the left lane could pass by the accident site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the 2 : 2 , Andre Hoffmann is hoping for the start of the season against Braunschweig , that optimi@@ zing the def@@ ensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first match of the season , Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result even if there were not the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two fo@@ es too much , and we have to get better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the O@@ re Mountains , the three @-@ chain must also be further optimized .
and a gate after an imp@@ etus , the lag@@ o@@ ons don &apos;t want to catch up again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one will be on line next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better right after the experience in the preparation with the three @-@ man , than with the Vier@@ erk@@ ette .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just finished in the three @-@ position on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o G@@ ieß@@ elmann players who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequis@@ ite is , but that we harmon@@ ize even better and we do not afford to play as many ab@@ uses in building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one cannot speak after a draw from a mis@@ erable start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to talk about a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight game days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fresh since they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an asc@@ ension favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know as 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the in@@ def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are a light favourite on Sunday to meet at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep it away just because we have the right to come under the first six is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ sinn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ y , whose record is quite positive at just one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Chief coach .
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so , spar@@ kle will not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ old application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medizin ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medi@@ cin@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started performing tests last year .
they should take the assessment of age more precisely during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were inferior .
until today , migration verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the person &apos;s age is ques@@ tioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results were consistent in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are pretty constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers have lied about his age .
in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the sought @-@ after person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det searched the 5@@ 81 published results , she stated that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in which X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I shots of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people in order to see whether they went sooner or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
jud@@ ging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is in@@ correctly assessed , low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is if the person is under 18 , in this case it is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , Head of Construction in the Department of Road Industry and Transport in the District of the District of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three reconstruction @-@ need@@ y bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is planned for October and it is certain that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , she has now come to the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the northern side has now received a 1.30 metre wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a constra@@ int , which is also used as an operating route .
on Friday an 2.20 m wide bridge cap should be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way will run .
the special thing is that these are pre@@ fabri@@ cated elements , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ etz@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip sensitivity has required the laying of cables through the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fiber cable where many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished at first .
for bridges between the building yard and the bus@@ driver in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is completely blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridge wre@@ cks amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to get under a hat .
the parties represented in the circle of vul@@ can@@ ism ( C@@ DU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully on this day because the Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein &apos;s Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell invites to the poster &quot; great campaign pr@@ el@@ ude . &quot;
and familiar names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D speakers but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the well ground , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , was really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , among them a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ur@@ deutscher potato salad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which also the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence mainly at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported from the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel , he took care of such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had initially ques@@ tioned in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because due to the already built @-@ up Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ me is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : around 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D chair@@ woman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers who wait for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch hold their spe@@ eches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
something more than an hour is the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is to be postpon@@ ed shortly after 9 pm .
the police can put aside - no special inci@@ dents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ oning Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ konzer@@ te morgen , Sonntag , um 20 Uhr in der Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan fol@@ klore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top @-@ class orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is a solo@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire to not only cross the boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the various gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach finishes with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games mix to an intri@@ gu@@ ing Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che with its particular acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about her bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I bite into gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ended up bitter at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette act@@ ress insured against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with whom I have set up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think about , I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and seriously believed in it .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never really liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them she said according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show biz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at school time when they preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven I told me the children , I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , sc@@ ared and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think of myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public does not like to educ@@ ate her love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect that you are in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me vulnerable , but I don &apos;t like to justify the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of West Virginia announced that he changes the party
the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and lots of thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in rejo@@ icing .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump announced a great announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states , and from his father inherited a coal business .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Repub@@ lican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening , in which it said : &quot; the party change from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , which would rather prevent us from working on making our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , inspiring message , &quot; said the R@@ NC President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian exc@@ use for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the worldwide leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , lob@@ te on Thursday , what he described as an obvious alle@@ g@@ ation from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included again in the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF @-@ Congress on the eve of World Athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were cut away from competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comment@@ aries , the IA@@ AF meeting voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ADA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer to this day , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e to rep@@ orters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships that start Friday in London based on the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the director of IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said rep@@ orters in London after a speech at IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mour@@ ning for Mali short@@ ened soldiers
at a fun@@ eral service in Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two have been thinking of a helicop@@ ter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
the Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( C@@ DU ) , said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts of their profession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice that they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ tmann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to live on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a total wa@@ ist of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar Dom St. Peter .
at mid@@ day only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the fun@@ eral proc@@ ession began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the German army and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( C@@ DU ) and the general secretary of the Federal Army Volker Wi@@ eker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream s@@ add@@ les laid down on ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arms in the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the church Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers persec@@ uted the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Ley@@ en called the opposite soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and entered into sat@@ anic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ tmann made the flight operation of the combat helicop@@ ter tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Commander of the Reg@@ iment , to whom the soldiers belong , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have mo@@ cked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister of the Ley@@ en : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral ceremony , the coff@@ ins were taken from the cathedral .
when and where they will be ref@@ unded , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave near his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
that divided the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen was agre@@ eing with her husband &apos;s decision , it was said to be in the message .
where Prinz Hen@@ rik is buried , is still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he retired in 2016 and also puts the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ ge@@ ma@@ hl &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as Hen@@ rik didn &apos;t get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by explained , the owner of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for over the past 50 years .
the born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ racy , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French emb@@ assy .
during his later wife &apos;s sympathy , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious stand at the Dan@@ es in his nearly 50 @-@ year rule .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was gay , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk sm@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand @-@ critical intellectual , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister W@@ eil wants a quick re @-@ election
C@@ DU and F@@ DP from a possible majority in Lower Saxony
the Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , but he does not want to come back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the parliament voted on Friday for the dis@@ solution of parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) was over@@ thrown in a serious crisis before a Gre@@ ens dep@@ u@@ ties from their state parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) .
five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from C@@ DU and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the C@@ DU , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ DU @-@ Fra@@ ktion@@ sh@@ ef Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler is willing to recommend it to his faction .
thus C@@ DU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
until now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new parliament is scheduled to be scheduled on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to continue to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan W@@ eil considers it imper@@ ative that the Land@@ tag decides as quickly as possible his self @-@ resolution .
the C@@ DU faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility of the Minister @-@ President ur@@ ges the confidence and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be examined legally clean@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in peace all questions will be discussed if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a follo@@ wer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the rebel@@ li@@ ous dep@@ u@@ ties to return their land convention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that she has received her Land@@ tag and@@ at , which she has received via the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided the Chairman Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the El@@ ke T@@ westen decision greatly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she deliberately chose not to lead a pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the resig@@ nation of the Lower Saxon Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen as tre@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) decision to quickly re @-@ elect the parliament .
the resig@@ nation of T@@ v@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian stelle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its final van@@ ity and fru@@ stration with their personal interests before the well @-@ being of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised the Secretary @-@ General of Hubertus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the C@@ DU in Lower Saxony is taking this dirty fru@@ gal play and tries to beat it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lower Saxony &apos;s C@@ DU spokes@@ person Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ u@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ westen into the C@@ DU .
the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ westen to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 country election .
the C@@ DU was at that time the strongest power , SPD and Gre@@ ens before the SPD , but in the parliament a very thin majority had a voice .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison@@ ing , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) Spe@@ ech and Rep@@ ly .
Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ed eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery @-@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
does Al@@ di take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the insur@@ er is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
nevertheless , my house has immediately stopped and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s concern .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
the trade has just as much concern to the manufacturers that the sold products are market@@ able and harm@@ less .
if eggs are exceeded by 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg in eggs , they are not able to transport .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , it is not the factories to blame .
are factories and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , the production companies have no immediate fault .
on the contrary , they must account for presum@@ ably illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always there is too little contro@@ l@@ ure in the case of emer@@ gen@@ cies .
is it missing only on the staff or even the sli@@ pper@@ y competence ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent .
this is precisely why a consistent clari@@ fication of such happ@@ enings and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where off@@ ences can be present is of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food @-@ sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get only safe and ready @-@ to @-@ use foods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are ou@@ tra@@ ged at law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by means of the pan@@ elled , manufacturers , distributors and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the post@@ ure of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect all the competent authorities that the facts will be elu@@ ci@@ dated quickly and completely .
how to influence the financial rules of football on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s rel@@ ocation to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not inter@@ fere with Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organisation which monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair @-@ play rules launched by the UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that the transfer from Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s rel@@ ocation to France .
with security , PSG can easily make money , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar will sign up and bring it to a galax@@ y of other stars , given the support of the team by the rich family of Qatar .
clubs may apply a lot of money to the acquisition of players , but have to counter@@ act with legitimate income sources , which allow them the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concent@@ rating on the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ idency of the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , his successor of Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are off excessive expenses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly FF@@ P isn &apos;t dead and we will definitely rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PSG has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause from Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it can distribute the amount for b@@ illing over the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the funds for the next five years can be reported to EUR 44.@@ 4 million in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 met the PSG together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PSG was awarded a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was lo@@ wered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ board their financial supervision by blowing up their income through companies that are connected to the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ act company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PSG payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come to Qatar via payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors are going to be easily figur@@ ing out such a man@@ eu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive every attempt to avoid the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PSG about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .
the latest published reports show that the 2015 / 16 segment achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of EUR 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year still have to be published .
PSG expected Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the contract .
the Spanish le@@ ague was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s &apos;s departure by claiming that PSG would hurt FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS related to Qatar &apos;s last ownership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports @-@ ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and this has changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new belt supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Frey AG has produced chocolate for the Swiss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the close cooperation is facing a potential end : the airline will re@@ write the order . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the Air@@ line will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Frey , we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white cardboard sheets of 14 grams per year distribute the flight att@@ endants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of order according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros @-@ subsidiary achiev@@ es an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious job for a gun manufacturer .
the Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are interested in the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report Cho@@ col@@ at Frey seeks to rene@@ w a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not re@@ achable for a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chocolate tablets spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Swiss concluded a treaty with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary Bar@@ ry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Frey .
the airline collabor@@ ates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ h@@ aul flights the customers of the First Class are p@@ am@@ pered with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class n@@ apped passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi from Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi from Cho@@ col@@ at Frey .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi from Cho@@ col@@ at Frey is also distributed on the short route , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year gr@@ unge era ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter turned the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ ehler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things .
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our fac@@ ebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for an appealing box of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by sti@@ ff@@ ening to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play g@@ eile children who are grown up - nevertheless , they managed to reg@@ ain the final part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten Years L@@ ater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his adults who are now playing adults is less emoti@@ onally u@@ pro@@ oted and his par@@ ody goes more after the wat@@ ering can principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ year @-@ old as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at one point , a character has a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates , and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious co@@ op ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ gin@@ ity .
and there is another crazy @-@ like plot , involved in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good good impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt Dill@@ on &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old boy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could pose such fran@@ chise as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; series until he achiev@@ es what I considered his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LOW &quot; with his East @-@ West E@@ Q@@ tap@@ ography .
Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the road of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ tuned Gregor and an ide@@ alist I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an extensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice days for watching ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who carries a Re@@ agan @-@ mask is involved - that it often plays like a single . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with six long episo@@ des it is gone , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited on a lower length , could better deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef repeatedly visited the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby always occupied by two thick men , which dev@@ oured a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that the Western culture can do everything for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history and thei@@ rs .
blow against Dru@@ gs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , such as the At@@ tor@@ ney Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s office on Friday .
15 Compl@@ aints were arrested at the age of 25 years and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials placed large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
at the same time , two people were arrested at the same time in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two will presum@@ ably be ex@@ tradi@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators participated in the action .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were in operation .
the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organised crime crimin@@ ality , serious violence , temp@@ ted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has established Con@@ stance against organised drug traffi@@ cking in the Southern German area .
among the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning the large @-@ scale operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the course of the investigations , above all Italian nation@@ als res@@ um@@ ed with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
Weise lam@@ ents great gaps in the alien @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the alien @-@ register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions on asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has report@@ edly drew attention to a media report on large gaps in the Central Registry .
short@@ com@@ ings in the data registered there may result in some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and dep@@ ort@@ ations , in an analysis conducted by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
in the register , according to the data , ten million people are registered with foreign nation@@ ality , among them 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been adequ@@ ately maintained , data quality has not been good in parts so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data inputs can significantly slow return processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on paid people , EU citizens are gr@@ asp@@ ed that would not have to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false agen@@ das have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a dist@@ orted debate on how to deal with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the federal government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with less than 16 year old children , if they have entered from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerg@@ es from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Osn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in paper it says that BA@@ MF will conduct such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , as the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant moves to another EU country , this state can send it back into the country of entry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with poor children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees for the reception and housing of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficiently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic political spokes@@ person on the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system for human rights and a threat to child welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood from living quarters living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided the blood donation service to other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jürgen Gre@@ ule and his now 100 donations have now distributed 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , the congregation in the meeting of the Municipal Council appl@@ au@@ ds multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in@@ geni@@ ous how our body is designed for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available to stran@@ gers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Karl@@ hein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Kreis@@ blatt Director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preser@@ ves are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three people could benefit from a blood donation .
simultaneously , corn makers reported from the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 sp@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the DR@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , a few years ago , the change to the theatre was led to higher numbers of participants .
previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ beer were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .
half so many book Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave up ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice .
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members expected to increase in this month , as weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on domestic income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall .
but they sign@@ aled that in the next few years , interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the M@@ amm@@ ut economic package issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the next February , although it was said that now it is expected that they will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , GDP will remain weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households continued to strain consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets are expecting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step by step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the Po@@ und dropped by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest increase and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2 % in the preceding three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to rise by 0.3 % in the third quarter although it will slightly recover after the bank at the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing first becomes even worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until it will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final judgement on interest rates , the call for interest increased , as the inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ imp@@ elled households , with three political decision makers in July demanded a 0.5 % increase .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said this was expected and it will be attra@@ cting it over the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the exceeding of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributed to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive , as the len@@ ders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages close , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be controversial HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the drug in the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that prior to sexual intercourse , pre@@ exposure phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by some 86 percent , is now being delivered from the health service to a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the App@@ eals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should fund it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) described it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to allow people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ exposure pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medications used prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in case of infections .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken everyday or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , appropriate participants will be identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also opt @-@ in to participate in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competition .
the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence as used in a large scale , recorded and implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in which more than three decades of sustained progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , if targeted on vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled individually and not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and delayed implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that they will contribute to ending the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society one step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square feet apartment has been completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architect and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on one another without having to bend us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not just about building a simple platform , but to put steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short cor@@ ridor is mirr@@ ored to allow him to work longer .
in the kitchen the mirr@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all cut@@ lery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so that when you push the door , it is very easily gli@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the bottom size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high @-@ quality materials giving the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love yourself in the electric so@@ ckets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square metre numbers of something standard in something quite ast@@ o@@ unding .
indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you might choose to leave them .
brothers struggling for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an argument because of one of the biggest real estate Imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clear how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate about the separation takes place at the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there she founded West@@ co jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for US $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now includes offices in the town centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler , as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ b .
following an agreement with her dec@@ e@@ ased father , Col@@ in - was described by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 316 million and Paul amoun@@ ting to 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the app@@ or@@ tions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - including Col@@ in , as Paul claims to have excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he is hoping to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the case with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held law firms .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen in the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ shop of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies . Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation become bitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in kept himself very backward , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered via SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our family name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hope still for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the president &apos;s media ab@@ stin@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ LI@@ TI@@ CO reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course .
here is a piece by rep@@ orter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior staff on his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House that he wanted to fix : bad information falling into the president &apos;s hands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring its medi@@ ate .
President Tr@@ umps relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry for an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election officer Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tr@@ umps &apos;s Twitter habits under control , according to six former election campaigns , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption involves a steady engagement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that sl@@ umps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter habits ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign commission@@ ers know something that we don &apos;t know for others - that tr@@ umps may have included twe@@ ets without their intervention even more ignition .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that have not sent Tr@@ ump .
if his staff managed to keep him away from him a few times , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent tr@@ ump controversi@@ es .
part of the problem is that people in a white house , composed of competing parties , try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world .
PO@@ LI@@ TI@@ CO - quite busy with this history - reported in May about the predi@@ le@@ ction of the advis@@ ers to provide the president for strategic reasons without any doubt .
this was an example described by rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that tr@@ ump is able to react to negative press sections such as a volcano , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on finding out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened at the end of February when someone announced a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ ok@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been ban@@ ished from Twitter for sham@@ ans or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has found false alle@@ g@@ ations in the past and has vo@@ iced it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Porter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective as a more effective manager , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still asp@@ ire to influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most wanted crimin@@ als get post from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will pray and hope .
the police all over Europe sent post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after crimin@@ als are naturally not known , references from the population will be hoped and asked .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action followed by winter on the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; Advent@@ skal@@ ender .
the experiences had shown that many volati@@ le in holiday destinations hide , it was called Euro@@ pol .
21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
since 2016 there has been the website ww@@ w@@ .e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times it was viewed .
36 of the online Ges@@ u@@ chten could have been arrested , at least eleven of them due to being published on the website .
travellers negoti@@ ating about a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est house owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travelers on the war base , which have negoti@@ ated a tren@@ ch drawn up by the community in order to re@@ claim a field in front of their mansion houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; milli@@ on@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought together horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by a dig@@ ging dig@@ ging from the Council to prevent their inci@@ dents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed its vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent further by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced through shame for implementation , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are back again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came in the evening , probably even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long teachings to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my common dest@@ ine if the Council can &apos;t stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last lap of these travelers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another lap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so as to move forward as soon as possible .
to support our evidence of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible do an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we proceed our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birk@@ enhof to Wald@@ hotel Luise
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wald@@ hotel Luise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is located in the former Birk@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wald@@ hotel Luise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the house in front of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re @-@ opened on March 1 , next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Birk@@ enhof by the former Ambiente Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenue by the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district , the hotel building was offered to the Land@@ rat@@ samt as a collective accommodation , which caused controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a land plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all , Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald was defending the hotel location and spoke to the house at that time .
he should keep right .
the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Birk@@ enhof Hotel on a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star category under the name Wald@@ hotel Luise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
they welcome Hotel Luise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Luise and now Wald@@ hotel Luise .
at the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof , Bau@@ sch@@ utt@@ grau has been in front of the entrance for some time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a high @-@ level downtown level , emphas@@ ises Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already conducted talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the noti@@ ons of the city were identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer is not willing to specify precisely .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external systems are also brought to front @-@ man , that is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is accessible from the restaurant , which is public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ affair : us @-@ Special Represent@@ ative cho@@ oses Grand Jury
in the Russia affair with US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special educ@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the panel has taken up the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to persons familiar with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has wi@@ dened and intensi@@ fied his investigation .
the CN@@ N transmitter reported that there are already the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between the el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time being targeted in the 2016 presidential election .
Mu@@ eller examines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ umps Ele@@ ction Cup and Moscow .
the focus of the investigations is to stand up to several men who acted as an advisor to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans during the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ umps of private and business under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote several weeks ago that the special mid@@ dle@@ man Tr@@ ump went to the Centre personally and under@@ took the accus@@ ation that the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the wake of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jura is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether an indictment is to be charged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand Jur@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are therefore also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; counts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mostly they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the body can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons for the hearing under o@@ ath .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
apart from Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ umps advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his former election leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort joined the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the asser@@ tion show that Mu@@ eller will not let themselves be in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the collection of an indictment .
however , the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y Russia &apos;s affairs as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic gives the demo@@ crats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he knew nothing of the establishment of a Grand Jury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this work usually works in secret , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it would not be determined against the President .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no reason to accept that something has changed from it , it was said in the declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this ro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become no@@ isy , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ey said in June a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against the national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after representation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
the un@@ rede@@ emed spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to dism@@ iss .
unlike an independent special agent of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair for the later resig@@ nation of President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the ur@@ ges of the President by the Ministry of Justice .
several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of repub@@ lican and democratic sen@@ ators presented the draft laws on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dismis@@ sed as easily .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant ic@@ eberg prop@@ els in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg has loos@@ ened itself from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s by just seven times the size of Berlin .
Das condemned the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the large col@@ os@@ sus , heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , is now driving north and will probably take two , three years until it was mel@@ ted .
with 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest iron gig@@ s that have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger to people from him .
however , as far as climate change has played a role in the fall of the ic@@ eberg , it is un@@ clear according to research data .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ down@@ s in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it always grows further into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e was disturbed by the balance of w@@ ax@@ ing and ab@@ om@@ iting a few years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is crum@@ bling there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , as the front edge has never been with@@ drawn as far as at present .
in addition , the ice sheet is under sus@@ pen@@ se and can fall apart if a piece is broken down at a key .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it produces after melting .
however , the loss of the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ sen leads to the fact that glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow far more quickly than before .
this could possibly raise the sea level , but only in little measure , the British research project for monitoring the Ant@@ arc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) writes .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth biggest Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s of Ant@@ arc@@ tica after A@@ WI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
there it stops regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the iron shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists it is controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will be growing again or coming back in the long term and possibly collap@@ ses , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not trace the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ eberg on climate change , in recent decades many sk@@ inn@@ ed f@@ ishers of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have been cr@@ ushed .
this long tip of Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the decrease in temperature has contributed to the decline .
in the last 50 years the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula war@@ med around three degrees and t@@ amed to the areas in which the temperature increases the fastest .
C@@ DU wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the C@@ DU calls out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the circle day has en@@ du@@ red 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have their first working day .
the apprentic@@ es@@ hips at the circle are obviously very sought after .
some 620 applications had to be recorded for the places in vain this year .
however , the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increasing demands and tasks .
at present there are still 50 un@@ occupied places with M@@ ett@@ mann .
the search interface Pub@@ Psy@@ ch offers an easy to use search interface in English ,
the C@@ DU wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the short@@ age of skilled labour in administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the request of the parties , the administration shall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recru@@ itment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term needs of skilled workers but to counter@@ act forward @-@ looking application short@@ ages , it means .
the overall concept should be oriented to the inside and outside , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and involve an educational offensive , call for C@@ DU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition by public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees , the disease @-@ related or age @-@ related service , is coming out of the service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest time for action so that there will be no more jobs un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , Leader of the C@@ DU , goes beyond the common request with his party .
he did not care for a big surprise for a long time when he publicly challenged the recru@@ itment cap and start@@ led the rest of the parties .
people want all possibilities to be checked , which enable an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satis@@ factory solution at short notice , the circular administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the affiliated towns - should strive for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the C@@ DU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than it actually fores@@ ees collective bar@@ gaining for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently strictly dict@@ ated , increases or more money exist only if you switch to a higher level orient@@ ated towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees care about the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law .
last but not least due to the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned that NGOs who use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean have warned that they cannot continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Home Secretary Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner Daily La St@@ ampa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Jugend Save &apos; , because their squ@@ ad had effectively collabor@@ ated with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation for a year , refused to express itself to detailed alle@@ g@@ ations of the Italian Prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the saving of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had monitored the boat from &apos; Jugend Save &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is assumed that his crew takes off infl@@ atable migrants , which are delivered to them directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least one meeting took place only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s case , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ throwing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must first of all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been declared to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization doctors are without limits ( MS@@ F ) .
in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharp@@ ly over the last few weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month via economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine ham@@ lets bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region , to enjoy Tri@@ als and S@@ ights for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation at the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ desheim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream levels .
in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents , for which long tri@@ als were rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
once again the look@@ out point reached a look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wn &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days a lot of altitude metres were said again .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga upgra@@ des for e @-@ sport
in future , the sport stars are sitting in front of computer con@@ soles , rather than struggling with wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
fact is : e @-@ Sport has long been a serious business , has become a lu@@ cra@@ tive business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high scales .
these have also recognized the first German lig@@ n@@ ans who are increasingly involved in this area .
the start made 2015 of the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are some clubs asc@@ ending on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the next weekend , FIFA World Federation organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London , where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PSV Ein@@ d@@ hoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , one could be far more present on these markets online more than once per year to send the Federal lig@@ aments to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
in the e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or just the football simulation FIFA on a level of competition .
long ago , like in the normal sport , Li@@ gen was established where professionals compete against each other .
and at Asian Games , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to the ordinary .
Ingo FRO@@ B@@ Ö@@ SE also dealt with the question for a long time .
for Professor at the German Sp@@ orth@@ och@@ schule in Cologne E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical responses that can be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and quick response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but FRO@@ B@@ Ö@@ SE also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform on online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sport failed .
the scientist highlights the high integ@@ rative effect of E @-@ Sports .
the players are internationally on the road , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by the Del@@ o@@ itte company and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ aktive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predi@@ cts rapid growth in the e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
in three years , turnover is expected to be at 130 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is little difference between the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football le@@ ague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports like hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte couns@@ ell@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
international are many countries already .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition provider Uni@@ ver@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe too .

Michelle Carter do@@ omed to suicide because of the lyrics , which Conrad Roy writes to suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Carter was sentenced in June for a fatal killing of Conrad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy &apos;s father said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ sol@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness .
dressed in red pants and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter was standing with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes , when she was convi@@ cted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that makes them completely de@@ pl@@ orable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness will have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there was &quot; no day when I did not use the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain , which we will carry for eternity with us to be there for his sisters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the knowledge that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a aunt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer the only person with whom I had been together every day since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to ask someone to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a car in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang on , spring from a building , kitchen yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told Carter &apos;s attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who def@@ ended Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x who was sentenced in 2007 for murder at her British ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is not a coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern con@@ veys a great season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
something was different from his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi squ@@ ash , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made his rush to his arm .
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner told afterwards , after his first use as a Bavaria captain .
good , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could interpret Kim@@ i as well .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a guide in the C @-@ El@@ f , which had been com@@ promised from the holiday , but he was chosen as a guide .
it is best to spread sweet@@ ness to those people who want to trust a lot , which you want to keep in your mood .
so whoever has been chosen to take the heritage of Lah@@ m can only use a small extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

right back , this is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and at all , Kim@@ i worked in this starting @-@ formation like the one who can take the helm best .
he gave orders , tried to direct the un@@ used tro@@ upe .
he had the view of the whole , while many others were occupied with himself .
V@@ idal with it to re@@ play his missing fitness ( did not fold ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches to connect to the services of the Asia @-@ Voy@@ age ( also just related ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le will not have a negative impact in their first appearance in Bavaria &apos;s Tri@@ ko@@ t .
that , after all , worked quite well .
Sü@@ le went next to Kim@@ i , Rud@@ y before the defense , both ag@@ itated sover@@ eign@@ ly .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le also tried a few times in the set @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y ad@@ mits that the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he too showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in connection to the game .
Rud@@ y , for example , did not give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but rather six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to his new fellow players after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard about Sü@@ le an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

company content with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischer minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Evel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) and Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Economy Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time t@@ ad@@ dle the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , President of the Association of Free Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest round@@ about sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year , the ministry hopes for a plan of planning until 2021 is expected to be the building law .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Office of Germany .
the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Cornelia Hol@@ tmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nat@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier asp@@ ires , as from Wis@@ sing , to produce a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend in German wine exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people wanting to establish their own company , the I@@ HK is pra@@ ising .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional incen@@ tive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is planned for the completed master exam and 2500 Euro , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years of the master &apos;s education .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , quick facts are possible , at the same time out of the country at the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive of the I@@ HK Trier .
from 56 new engineers who want to employ bis@@ cu@@ its in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility , only 29 positions have been occupied until now .
the BC@@ CI calls for more orders to be allocated to external offices .
C@@ DU @-@ FRA@@ K@@ TION@@ S@@ VI@@ ZE , Christian Bald@@ auf , refers to calculations of the Court , the land investing more than EUR 20 million in 2017 and 2018 than proposed in the preservation of state roads as proposed .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the short@@ age of skilled workers in the region .
in addition , the current broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the rating of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stock@@ pil@@ ing Internet connections and break@@ outs .
ex @-@ Economic Minister Evel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still in the super@@ visory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she had already cleared the field after four months because of dis@@ agreements .
Audi should change 8@@ 50.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day prior to the announcement of Audi BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the chairman said the company was the opinion that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - Diesel vehicles to ban or restrict .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma .
the costs for the car manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ alizing the exhaust gases em@@ itted from diesel vehicles also increase what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of disp@@ uting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations if a car was tested , but on normal driving conditions .
several employees of Volkswagen were indi@@ cted in the United States ; others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the motor development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be brought to court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to b@@ yp@@ ass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could burden Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the benefit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ases and laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was at times one of the most @-@ published carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , the no@@ oses of his characters are his trademarks .
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian still draws and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he presented himself as an artist for fortune telling cards - which fru@@ str@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough at the end of the six@@ ties : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures stand in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table , works every day almost ten hours .
about cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches still find his dro@@ l@@ ful figures worldwide much dis@@ sem@@ ination worldwide .
for six years now he has been working on a carto@@ on animation and a TV series with his characters .
the main person in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand foot@@ ball@@ ers as an opponent .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which should come to the cinema wall in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o says .
the script is not written by him .
that is why he tends to rely on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without wor@@ dless .
lav@@ ender from Provence under threat from climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
lav@@ ender is decl@@ ining due to the conditions that are remin@@ is@@ cent of d@@ rought and because of the disease passing away , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , have great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the service life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small ch@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf c@@ ades , and in very dry weather there are so many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
lav@@ ender oil attracts not only for holiday@@ makers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant clo@@ cks with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered are better water distribution and ev@@ ac@@ uation of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ ing@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the murder of a journalist empha@@ sizes the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office that were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the rep@@ orter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal p@@ ains suff@@ ice .
there are drug traffi@@ ckers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ list of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest of violence , and throughout the country the bodies are frequent , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has been in office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection following attacks and threats , and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter , her editor and her In@@ spir@@ ator von Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hang@@ s on the façade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orters discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Special At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has initiated only two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of kill@@ ings associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organized crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
at Ri@@ odo@@ v they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are imm@@ ac@@ ulate and although the terrain is now more ob@@ sol@@ ete .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very fool@@ ish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we know not the Why , we di@@ str@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing to silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since ri@@ val fac@@ tions fight to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that one or more people are shot in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums of drug roy@@ alty that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken by the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings contributed to the murder .
first of all there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ enes Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed v@@ ein members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez to leave Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , who had published the same story to leave the country for its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the problem of drugs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
rep@@ orters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to handle .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever she went .
he gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that suits you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce @-@ Team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was able to curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for the routine of his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do their job best and to stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret starting and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happened to J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer in Sin@@ alo@@ a , just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mix of lu@@ cra@@ tive sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the space where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no cell phones were allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were instru@@ cted by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the rep@@ orters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen that the governor himself was not trust@@ worthy .
it is months since rep@@ orters have gone to the mountain scenery , where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce li@@ cked on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of former well @-@ known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é on state expenditure concent@@ rating on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosec@@ utor , a kid@@ n@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a rep@@ orter came from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who owned the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the entire century .
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors have been accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this pub , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military assault .
only a few months earlier , readers would have considered the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kid@@ n@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
journalist Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez s@@ nat@@ ched a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist for the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
in the whole country journalists have become lou@@ der by typ@@ ing in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on side@@ ways and buildings .
this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gain international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez acc@@ uses the authorities to spy on journalists and let them move because they have said the truth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has since been asked to be re @-@ divided by the government because it is concerned that their anger has viol@@ ated their objec@@ tivity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , the government officials involved and a valid society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters are not only killed by drug gangs but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blank@@ et with organised crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the &quot; artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; media group assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
nobody forget the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern Border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a notice supp@@ os@@ edly signed by the Z@@ etas cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones were lying next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Laredo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the city council of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking is frigh@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was rep@@ orter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all of their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a series of found@@ ries with ri@@ vals and security forces near the resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated as it was promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the on@@ board edge , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
sir@@ ens stayed nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were frigh@@ tened at all , they did not show it .
under the immense portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible to all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his mark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when on the same day when J@@ avier was murdered , the inter@@ ns asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ aking to avoid its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a frigh@@ tening .
researchers have now found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian min@@ er have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that his fl@@ ak@@ y skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she would have had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whis@@ pered din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived between 110 million and 112 million years in the middle of the chal@@ k period .
its incredibly well preserved condition has amaz@@ es researchers that describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something which seemed out of the surrounding rock at the plateau , and decided to look more closely .
the fossi@@ ls discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years trying to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ umping .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you just b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a wall @-@ shifting tank , probably threatened by flesh @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as contra@@ c@@ eption , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to better mix into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the shade of the counter is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it suggests that din@@ osau@@ rs were h@@ unted by enough pressure by eating meat din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which signals that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was subjected to a real battle for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors have to have been the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous Age , &quot; Brown said .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal on indications of his life , including his con@@ served Dar@@ min@@ ate to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far@@ ther inland far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just beat a little with your eyes , you could almost believe he is sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , that stood on two legs , penet@@ rated the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was h@@ unted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hips .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ik@@ es that prot@@ ru@@ de from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the pan@@ zer@@ te her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sement of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the skin @-@ b@@ ust still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a profit in the lot@@ tery .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are fed up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales on his sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a massage car@@ n@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles @-@ long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the late Thursday afternoon .
according to the first data of the police there were about 5@@ pm between the junction Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 cars , among them probably also trucks , crashed .
at first , there is no indication of the exact number of injuries .
it was easy to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large number of rescue vehicles was at the accident point . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a round about ten kilometres formed .
like a AZ rep@@ orter , it also occurred on the counter @-@ train to massive ob@@ stru@@ ctions - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade noted the signs of the vehicle handle@@ bars , which now have to calculate with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between an automobile transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a helicop@@ ter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is pun@@ is@@ hable in the train and sle@@ eps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : Mu@@ ff@@ f .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an un@@ an@@ gled or pul@@ ls the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
postcard control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the German rail@@ ways are currently testing the loose ticket control .
one simply confirms by mobile phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
currently a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be available at the beginning of next year on many other long @-@ distance routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a rail@@ road nar@@ r@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and one must have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
you have to also buy it via the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : you get into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customers a button for electronic de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation appears .
the traction guides get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train companion arrives at the ticket inspec@@ ting role in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already de@@ valu@@ ated online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue to keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn is to use passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to travel relaxed without ticket inspec@@ tions by train service personnel , check out the DB Navigator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Manager of DB Fern@@ verkehr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often drive train knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , the ticket inspec@@ tions are among the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
for many times one has himself , but in any case one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to demonstrate .
the result is endless discussions between train companion and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in the control of their own tickets and takes the Schaff@@ ner at the end the time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wh@@ os@@ oever Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to its core .
just one day after arriving in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , letting them rent and sc@@ roll through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly ret@@ we@@ eted on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was killed , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted an image of Brown &apos;s empty body , which was stretched out on the streets and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she dropped her mobile phone to return to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
there were photos from the police band and people crying out and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , a different polic@@ eman said his ri@@ fle and cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell rec@@ alled her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt sho@@ ch@@ frost .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she picked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the topic of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the age of 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance which consists of people &apos;s point of view who live in community and have filled the streets to request answers .
when Fer@@ rell came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown , the two discussed a conversation that she had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people need to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution , and what we must do to free ourselves to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I have the good fortune to give her an experience , in which she personally experienced no ec@@ centric rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel that I would be a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the Police Department , which became a Camp@@ site when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local manager who made lunch .
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to prot@@ esters .
slowly , a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism has completely changed after August 9 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black congreg@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it has come all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell , during an evening demonstration , met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ eram@@ an Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came to mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their res@@ ili@@ ence .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not cent@@ ered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his commitment brought the project closer together with six other nati@@ ves followed by the team of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years to Brown &apos;s shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ &apos;s &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life as she marri@@ es herself and marri@@ es her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people there must be a certain vulner@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we constantly fight on different fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell was selected as a heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence , even though it was at the foref@@ ront because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the ra@@ cial links between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a voice and she feels bound to this memory since she went on the street in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold , the subject hardly leaves one .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to the bit @-@ gallery say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; need no man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Scholz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city , of which the other shops benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then ble@@ eds .
added : the gallery will be exactly planned on the plot on which the main market hall stands in which 13 direct mark@@ ers offer their products .
with the start of the construction work it will be finished .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a place with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been shopping for many years almost a week in the Mark@@ thalle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; market hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the past@@ ures are always very happy .
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct mark@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery , the height of the rent comes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping bags in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ store or supermarkets : I think it &apos;s su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are plenty of them in our city .
you can see how many shop stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly market , it &apos;s all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
because after all the goods offered there is fresh , mostly directly offered by the producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see , shop stores in a shopping centre are rented by larger companies , as the local r@@ ents are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably van@@ ish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peasant market hall go to during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery really comes out at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the Ges@@ pen@@ st Bit @-@ Galerie manage to distribute all the shops in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
and a shopping center that stands empty does not need anybody .
in my opinion it would have been better to support a real peasant market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall , it is thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the peasant market hall is damaged , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , which resem@@ ble themselves almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ fern and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence , after being publicly classified as a secret diplomatic news on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Bec@@ oming res@@ emb@@ lance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ woman and a pione@@ ering dis@@ sident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg embra@@ ced the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted by M@@ anning and created out of the 30 portraits , as someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations , but also created for identity .
M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
her image was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white self @-@ ie in which M@@ anning visi@@ bly sits un@@ well on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ in@@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigar@@ ette mu@@ te and che@@ wing g@@ um by extra@@ cting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
this was the time when they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while they were in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t be visited at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprison@@ ed M@@ use have become un@@ equal bri@@ efs , who in the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the president would transform the President &apos;s judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually just a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings released release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy coinci@@ dence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the rigid divisions he should actually fix .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things are going to happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , M@@ anning called for an end to &quot; automatic spl@@ itting , whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific ency@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ways , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take along is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic no@@ vels .
it shows M@@ anning as she emerg@@ es with a free spre@@ ader in the hand from the discipline bar@@ racks of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they make your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the mas@@ ks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ chari@@ ots that gather like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , &quot; Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement which was also behind its release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nation @-@ wide human @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford which was sought as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ she ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the Cook County Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a public warning system published by the Chicago police agency states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still dead in the scene for dead , and det@@ ectives investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ she has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice @-@ President of University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ she was now in ass@@ essments and was excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a criminal matter which is examined by the competent authorities and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and wanted him to be .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi told that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , who said that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that la@@ ths and war@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team at Grand Plaza released an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic inci@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the W@@ ADA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian Vice President Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ADA ) will be implemented for the restoration of Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the timet@@ able , Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the W@@ ADA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ ADA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the code which describes the criteria for the re@@ establishment of Rus@@ ada and recently published on the Organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything for Russia to cause concern .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the W@@ ADA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigations approved by the W@@ ADA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ ko &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with Russian sales office at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov reported problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rus@@ ada was excluded in November 2015 as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal of the W@@ ADA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after visiting Moscow &apos;s headquarters in Moscow in July , W@@ ADA General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that Rus@@ ada moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next one
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to check luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity some workers did not trust the trial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on w@@ ax@@ ing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , offer specialist groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ yp@@ ass the C @-@ Suite leaders and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up Gl@@ int , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
saved as a favorite to look at new things you post ... &#124; Hello , just wanted to mention , I liked this article . it was funny . keep oon posting ! &#124;
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most dis@@ comfort and which managers have low approval results - so you can re@@ boot why .
companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture must remain so that you won &apos;t be the next one involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups , such as Gl@@ int , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cra@@ tive business possibility .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion , following the finance @-@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and detect , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
like Gl@@ int , Conver@@ cent companies can send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth @-@ maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report bad behavior .
and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Public Opinion gathered the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats its staff poor@@ ly or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,@@ 000 employees and more than 500 sites , Conver@@ cent has been used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , as the company uses Conver@@ cent , problems that have previously been identified by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment , or un@@ fair tra@@ inees will be identified and addressed more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to harvest Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed for ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both Gl@@ int and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and charge the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February , Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February by firms such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only st@@ akes .
the employees want to feel that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more oblig@@ ated to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent and Gl@@ int .
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten when their portfolio companies are running well . companies are running well when employees are committed and engaged .
if third @-@ party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 comments , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow people , ask yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed , who now condu@@ cts monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures the same day when a problem about Gl@@ int is reported , so saved .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customer , then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the bru@@ ins
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers chat on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled at the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return to the Water@@ man Football Center at 6 : 30 a.m. the next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already fully packed schedule of players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducted six game times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they should stop 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the formal playing preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on it three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ate on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , given the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already cleared a protective network behind a pe@@ at post , which will not be an easy task .
bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust it to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it is a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy fact @-@ check in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible fal@@ seh@@ oods and to send them to fac@@ tual check that may display results of the Fak@@ ten@@ check from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of whom believe that they also influenced US presidential elections 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being floo@@ ded in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to pun@@ ish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate h@@ ated post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts checking in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be launched .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories are challenged by fac@@ ten@@ ties of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; related article &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze @-@ music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tum@@ ul@@ tu@@ ous story from his cozy seat in the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and now has become inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosm@@ opol@@ itan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ tland . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters smell always after smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself were there .
ACH , ich liebe Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is so sm@@ itten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have reviewed my welcome greeting a little &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had been spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with pat@@ rons , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ia is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only granted full access until 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
Ta@@ geb@@ ü@@ cher , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps depic@@ ting who said : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch in order to have fought the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let everything go its way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ osen Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jes@@ uit priest , which the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , portra@@ yed by Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , who produced his own fun@@ eral , filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ts : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be quite g@@ aun@@ er , always make debts and spend money for things they could not afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men solved their debt crisis by getting rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote Er@@ bin@@ nen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his mission in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique scre@@ aming experiences
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a San@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I must be ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf veil@@ ed
with the envel@@ oping of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched her campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed Nelson Art@@ z want to keep the logo and the slogan secre@@ tly .
at the end of August , the highlight of the campaign is to give a feast on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking the posters at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they write on their yesterday released website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer we are very well aware of the beauty and attra@@ c@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique unique selling point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she stands in competition with other commun@@ es .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can cost a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount for its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on reti@@ re@@ es and promotions in the officers cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance , a normal operation .
but nothing is a routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the Government of Government , the five vice @-@ champ@@ ions and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also participated .
thus , the civilians were in the Y@@ AS in the number of survivors .
the government forces the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air strikes and the nav@@ y were removed .
since the failed coup , head of State Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired the 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the wire @-@ pul@@ ler of the put@@ sch@@ ver@@ su@@ ch .
against 486 people who allegedly participated in the coup attempt , it was negoti@@ ated in Ankara for this week .
already on the day after the coup Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow of a &quot; god &apos;s gift , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan really has a grip on the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ comfort in the Military headquarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the general staff , there are concerns for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which manifest itself among other things in the abo@@ lition of the veil ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
the military guards at the army and the security forces at any rate continue .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan continued to fire another 73@@ 95 civil servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they made their appeal to their role as watch@@ men of the secular state .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pressed the power of the military step by step , not least of his appeal to the reform agenda of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan has targeted an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries seeking asylum , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not cause N@@ ato to be cold .
in any case , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after pur@@ g@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he proposes to lower the legal immig@@ rant to 50,000 a year , stri@@ c@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and endor@@ sed by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries will be dealt with Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to san@@ ction track for race @-@ up shuttle
over the past few months , over the past few months , the future of the race programme has been disp@@ uted - now it is supposed to be quite fast .
even before the end of the year , the route on which the tourist train runs , is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin on the track this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is particularly important for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Secretary of State Klaus S@@ ühl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair of the route was about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country anticip@@ ates 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , is currently being fin@@ alised , declared S@@ ühl .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ ing@@ ian railway as an operator have already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ ühl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a popular rail link between the stations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few months it was tested in the wake of a pilot operation , whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also very tender in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key to publish his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sc@@ out@@ fits have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human responses that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjust &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot accordingly and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturb@@ ing as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who would like a step@@ ford woman to be progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art s@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed to conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturb@@ ing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ missive feminine characteristics , the all@@ usions to rape , if you take a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : oppos@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , troubled a most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy .
their formation and their increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional enc@@ ore .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R recogni@@ zes their increasing popularity , they nonetheless remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what sick@@ ened out of the boundary zones can be very instru@@ ctive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or offensive until the free market is allowed to do so .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time in which women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who bo@@ asted to have sex@@ ually attacked women .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the worn @-@ out body and the hidden eye , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( al@@ beit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , when it comes to its &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are no real wives .
they cannot separate themselves from their companions or simply go away .
they have no placement or background story , nothing that points to independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the 2017 statement : maid service
m@@ umps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
it has become a certainty of the tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , pol@@ arized by the U.S. voters , have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all supp@@ os@@ edly supp@@ os@@ edly to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less has been noticed is the power of l@@ umps , families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ looking poet who lives in Chicago and has long been engaged with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with tr@@ ump in the White House everyone knows whom she knows , including the repub@@ lican relationship that she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and very peculiar on the same side .
for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is in a further context that it ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the resulting effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his ma@@ ids will no longer be cast off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans norm@@ alize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appear as an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with his standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of mad@@ ness - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in fact seem to be very mild in comparison to tr@@ ump .
when tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ous@@ el of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all clo@@ wns are gro@@ w@@ ling and the animals are twi@@ sted to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ loving music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the subject pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a wei@@ rd magical experience , since here two two @-@ year @-@ olds , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked .
on the other hand , during this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I we@@ ari@@ ed the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrist , which he suffered from prison authorities in a case in his cell .
due to murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder after an appeal to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day when he shot them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pret@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us maintained that he held his girl@@ friend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appe@@ ase this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Court said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four @-@ t@@ ear@@ ths from F@@ aults and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released into the vac@@ ations and in the advanced schools .
three of the students will go to college in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te greeted the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol of the dism@@ iss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes chose a young eagle , who grows up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Adler in Hüh@@ ner@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it bro@@ ods from his chi@@ ck@@ ens .
instead of a chicken soup , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , and the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain .
after that the classes presented three and four in the introduction of Y@@ vonne Frank a hen &apos;s tail .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder bore around the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the young is different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belonging to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished each four @-@ t@@ eller that he feels accepted in his new school .
thanks to the former school manager Michael Müller , who always j@@ umps back to school@@ s@@ sen@@ g@@ p@@ ecks , and the parents &apos; representatives followed .
the kitchen time now is over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
after two years of lessons , they only leave their students very un@@ awar@@ es , as it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ t@@ ad sler .
at the end all students had a song of summer time and holiday season .
in doing so , great joy broke out with the children .
eight initial regi@@ sters are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
in the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while an investigation is underway .
the Foreign Ministry reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have intensi@@ fied control over the free camp and place everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said the court may impose a fine fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel @-@ summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars .
they should improve the exhaust behaviour of cars from emissions classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives ass@@ essments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates dealt with are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oblig@@ atory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have the che@@ ers software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the retro@@ fitting has ordered the power @-@ driving federal office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the next few months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler has announced to address any person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done in their frames .
how long will the conver@@ sions be drawn altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the att@@ achments from the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update be ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
presum@@ ably foreign manufacturers would subsequently reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is there a massive decline in price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
but in the regions where driving prohi@@ bitions thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there is so far no loss of value for older diesel .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first ra@@ pper one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
this year singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars .
awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series therefore already announced to refra@@ in from taking part in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negle@@ ct the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make her point of view clear .
Kennedy @-@ Center named after former president John F. Kennedy is the biggest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
the former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will be reti@@ ring next year .
the job is already written - but suitable applicants are rare .
for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he teaches in the press .
he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that await his successor .
at the same time , he ad@@ mits that no application will fulfill the requirement profile yet .
at the next possible time , the city is looking for an architect or building engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , considering the regular periods of notice , it should still be enough time for a revision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Has@@ lach acts as a lower building authority for the Administ@@ rative Community , the applicant must demonstrate appropriate conclusions .
this function does not want to keep the city in any case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they can no longer fill them , citizens would need to go to Off@@ enburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the proximity of the town and the city itself is important , says W@@ acker , who speaks of a good business climate as well as good mood among authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in ministry , some major projects have accumulated to look back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future diverse projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz is about to be initiated .
the forti@@ fication bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium restoration is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only the latter will be@@ ech with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we are doing it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
there is a lot of space available for a master building master .
Has@@ lach &apos;s own farm and gar@@ dener can react quite flexi@@ bly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what is pure , &quot; if new buildings are approved , the out@@ going Stadt@@ bau@@ meister stres@@ ses .
in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries considerable responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good business climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if anyone wishes to be buried in Roland W@@ acker , according to information from Has@@ lach , a completed course of studies as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor with the field of architecture can demonstrate architecture and possess good knowledge in the areas of construction planning and building planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt accommo@@ dates high and civil engineering , construction guidelines , basic services , administration of urban properties , urban environment with Bau@@ hof and Stadt@@ g@@ är@@ t@@ ner@@ ei , as well as Unter@@ e Bau@@ recht authority including monuments protection .
bicycle on lines thrown off : rail@@ road track locked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators of the blue bike were thrown onto the lines in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators depart from two male offen@@ ders and have been looking for them since the night .
near the crime scene a rose sco@@ oter and a bike @-@ driver had been observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Lus@@ ati@@ an Kingdom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Austrian spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rators would have brought themselves to great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se the traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay @-@ minutes and the cost of rail transport , even sponsors of the railway customers could come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum is to be assumed , the spokes@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south run@@ way could be led without ob@@ stru@@ ctions .
just under ten passenger trains had failed Friday mor@@ nings , two of which concerned the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall off , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be exchanged .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your diges@@ tive system .
but a new study states exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
the incur@@ able condition in the US affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300@@ ,000 , causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ws , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the University of Washington that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food cannot penet@@ rate into the body .
cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far towards inflammation , an inflammatory bo@@ wel disease can result from this .
experiments have been found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice bearing a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of proteins in proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have made a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an the mice had in their food the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of l. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an promotes toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bo@@ wel @-@ lim@@ b if the same system also affects people .
the post @-@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a sort of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same parent , which had been kept separate , had not had this .
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ologists of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they did not develop an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers concluded L reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was cle@@ ans@@ ed out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an metabolism known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ ane values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan informed that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us protect l. reu@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tra@@ cts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho believes that after the mid@@ fiel@@ der player had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signing of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
M@@ atic , however , was excluded from the Pre@@ par@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which gave Mour@@ in@@ ho to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; Mour@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
besides M@@ atic Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when Mour@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed three new commitments this week , but he insi@@ sted that the club already had a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get three of four , for that I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bo@@ eing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Bo@@ eing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Michigan and moved in the shape of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Bo@@ eing had previously made such public@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Bo@@ eing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new heart@@ beat for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind still revol@@ ves : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , social @-@ democratic prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern .
only no fires from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important desire of the elec@@ toral cont@@ enders .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the staff from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House constantly monitor the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were heart@@ beats .
and one after the other .
after the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal C@@ DU sees a general signal against SPD and Gre@@ ens co@@ ali@@ tions .
&quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliably ruled , &quot; said C@@ DU @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber , Germany &apos;s editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of a Gre@@ ens dep@@ u@@ ties has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the elections of the country , his red @-@ green coalition thus lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from C@@ DU and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German CEO Michael Kell@@ ner called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous Dutch Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to give back their mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to the C@@ DU means a clear dis@@ appointment of the voters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and election leader of the Gre@@ ens on the Germany editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a SPD leader sigh@@ s , when the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is following the transition from the Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to the C@@ DU without his own government majority .
it is the pro@@ visional zen@@ ith of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD lands .
and no one knows what comes next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland @-@ election in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a blue eye , more not , the comrades hes@@ itated at the time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what it became - and it was all much worse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the do@@ ve , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te looked at the party sli@@ pper@@ y .
at the same time , the comrades in the weeks later re@@ acted .
then , when they had just opened new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him the next heart@@ beat came .
mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD LAN@@ DE@@ S@@ MP , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication it made all wrong what you can do wrong .
since then , Scholz fighting for his political survival .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
due to the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ affair and his role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese survey values came to an end .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely why , w@@ edge in recent weeks tried to put emphasis on acc@@ ents .
the aspi@@ ration of the former mayor of Hanover to expand its power in Berlin was not conce@@ aled by comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they promised to stabili@@ ze the party from w@@ edge .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , w@@ eil is no gu@@ ilt at the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz was not at all .
sometimes comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and above all to the rebel@@ li@@ ous parliament@@ arians in T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen poses her own career interests over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liament@@ ary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. T@@ westen won &apos;t have been elected to Parliament as a direct candidate , but on the national list of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens , so the Lower Saxon Member continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liament@@ ary Group , lam@@ ents a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the voters &quot; wil@@ le four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan W@@ eil as Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the German SPD as a top candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career presents a future C@@ DU representative the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments of the C@@ DU Niedersachsen .

those who want to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives STE@@ G urban development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review of what happened to date .
since 1991 it has been in sensitive remedi@@ ation areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the subsi@@ dy sum .
in the II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is important to also promote interior development and not only to open new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 4 April , from the government pres@@ i@@ dium of Karlsruhe , we received the information that there will be a restoration area III .
the sum amounts to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the community felt .
how is a renovation area now being created ?
one will , so Sch@@ in@@ dler go further , investigate where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is no interest whatsoever to rehabil@@ itate .
if necessary , the regional limits could then also be moved again .
the STE@@ G spent on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal states program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the programme are the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working relationships and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per plot , carried out .
the renovation area would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the funding period for the funding period has been running until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017 .
until September this year , however , the survey would only once again be carried out in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionn@@ aire for filling .
in November or December , the stat@@ ute must be made as possible , so that the restructuring can be started next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that each Commun@@ e had to carry out the predicted pre @-@ investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of evaluating the urban conditions and deciding when to rehabil@@ itate and to what extent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back to sens@@ ations himself and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
that is why there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow Fra@@ gebogen is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it works among other things about the structural condition and rehabilitation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hous@@ ehold and Housing Park &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , distribution and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled when operated in the building business premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding .
new building measures are also not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who first comes , first grin@@ ds first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot reserve funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or uses a micro@@ chip to come into house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ esth@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resem@@ bles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .

the advertising costs of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a Marine helicop@@ ter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military &apos;s data , up to 24,@@ 000 US dollars .
the green white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states .
the helicop@@ ter manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire brig@@ ade from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military office requested the presence of the helicop@@ ter in a frag@@ mentary order or fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter landed on the South La@@ wn , after the records of Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicop@@ ter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his super@@ visor , the vice @-@ president for aviation .
the message showed that the helicop@@ ter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 was cleared .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was at the helicop@@ ter during the event , while the unit &apos;s security guards remained on the ground during the time .
the records provided at TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was required in the end .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could viol@@ ate destiny .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you are shut up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the Deputy Command@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus for the reform of the health reform , which was in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for a photo @-@ surgery is unusual .
Tr@@ ump introduced an investigation in February when the Pres@@ idential air@@ plane performed in the background of his first Camp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ dienste , and his Twitter account is full of messages compl@@ aining about the use of the pres@@ i@@ ding aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states , produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to susp@@ end US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
as a tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event included the training needs of the crew &apos;s crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ter units flew in addition 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Non @-@ Pres@@ idency &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved to exhibit the helicop@@ ter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not stop bud@@ get@@ ary records for the Pres@@ idential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D compensation set for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual cost of operation of the helicop@@ ter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determining the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for rei@@ m@@ bur@@ sement rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the fees for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at this time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ended the use of the helicop@@ ter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Sik@@ or@@ sky and the Federal State Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicop@@ ter when he entered his tour through the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire brig@@ ade .
in the White House Tr@@ ump talked to the representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before a tri@@ cky task
&quot; &quot; &quot; runner @-@ up of the second tennis court &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ liga &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; joins the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ amm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ amm Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
despite the five games still fl@@ aw@@ less balance sheet , the leader of the second tennis court le@@ ague has gained the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially at the back positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the SV @-@ dorfer SV , especially the imports from the high North provide .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in dou@@ bles , &quot; says Z@@ ay looking at Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören und Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ sley ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be hard for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man is currently active in the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will play at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
really happy Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when on Wednesday evening he put his signature under the law to shar@@ pen the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his H@@ ast to leave the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the congress marked a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft is to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of local O@@ MV have been wor@@ rying about the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies .
the dr@@ one is huge .
however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions by Executive Order . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are twelve weapons at the moment of choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at what the Group could defend and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staffel 3 Trailer : ohne Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Das Cal@@ i Cart@@ el in der Hit@@ series von Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer un@@ covers , Net@@ fli@@ x &apos;s series is not over yet .
the relay three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest sho@@ cks of the show .
with the third relay the DE@@ A directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug trade in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 Company &quot; only with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) comm@@ its the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
back@@ wards : the town provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita mid@@ day again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in urban day@@ care centers the clock is turned back .
on September 1st , Kre@@ feld takes over food supply in the municipal day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant director in the field of youth assistance , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly sque@@ e@@ zed cooled .
the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area of 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 the children receive a hot meal during lunch time .
last day , 28@@ 00 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , there are not only children who are cared for 45 week@@ lies , in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision if children stay until 2 am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time forces have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the delivered foods , complement them with salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food out , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups , as well as sevent@@ y @-@ one bodies - decides on the scope of the timet@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for kit@@ ebo@@ arding to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the ch@@ and@@ enk@@ raft to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita premises - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be settled by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - apart from the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that it has found itself in cost comparison between self @-@ control and external allocation for the city as the most economical , is it from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong enough for approximately 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting director of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women join the coun@@ cils in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5th .
the Taliban released threats against a choice process which coinci@@ des with the transition from international mar@@ tial law to an advisory role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year the elections for the first time will be handed over to the government peac@@ efully from a democra@@ tically elected government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will rein@@ force Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elect@@ oral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of total registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

men are trying to eradi@@ cate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girls
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to the police information , the men asked the 13 @-@ year @-@ olds , who were staying with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ street , at 14.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to telephone the girl &apos;s phone .
but the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpet@@ rators tried to grasp the mobile phone and the N@@ eckl@@ ace of the girl , which , however , was mis@@ leading .
without prey the duo fled .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investments in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a union would like to ensure a long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glas@@ gow , for managers of the bis@@ cu@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which alongside other products hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cu@@ its .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s claim to express &quot; concerns that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be advanced . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ izer , Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and the Greater Glas@@ gow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow is urg@@ ently a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ person in Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Fili@@ al@@ eiter at T@@ oll@@ cross did not receive a letter from G@@ MB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we value continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly check our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations are changing at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PSG Barcelona warn of Ne@@ ym@@ ar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may be interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ en
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t leave Ne@@ ym@@ ar after she handed over an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve his release cl@@ ause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the incident ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous stamp , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete in the world . PSG offers sal@@ aries of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced its way out to the outside , although a source close to the Catal@@ an Board insi@@ sts that the club has always given its best to take care of it since its arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG @-@ President before this prospect ?
when Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club that wanted to sign a top player from PSG .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to make one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PSG @-@ Mittel@@ feld player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PSG did it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prize offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; report on the abuse of abuse was reli@@ eved by Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continues for discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication against the German press agency , he was expecting from the former Regen@@ s@@ burger bishop and present @-@ day Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ zed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false assessment of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand critic@@ ised the fact that during the reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the attacks in Regensburg no one doubt that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the princ@@ ess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is also said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you would like to go to the church and this is a frozen e@@ ater . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blo@@ ws were a quite normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are making it un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wron@@ g@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann attributed to R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mein Bruder des Papst &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the outcome of the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ? lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 547 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990 &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of assault , 67 dom@@ spar@@ ks sex@@ ually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially with high emoti@@ on@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be severe .
nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other accused , many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories are connected to him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal is reli@@ eved at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the inci@@ dents of violence practice at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports a conf@@ lic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many pupils highlight his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became tangible when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz did not bring top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as your bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is ever present in it .
there are just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly exemp@@ ted from any sus@@ pic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the princip@@ als of the pre @-@ school also took place outside of its sphere of influence .
at best , it can be accused of having experienced it too late or not having taken the first indications seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rede@@ mption &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus also the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes a very excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emoti@@ on@@ ality , which also led to bro@@ o@@ ding .
the fact that he did not just cra@@ wl with chairs and threw the keys on the floor , but also distributed ear @-@ fig@@ s and attracted too nau@@ gh@@ ty boys on the hair or ears , he himself had already given himself years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents like with teachers .
do you know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced it in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , they are of course Bag@@ at@@ elles .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( # 1.01 Pilot ) ( TV )
in the Bavarian pop@@ e many who have never understood him are still ze@@ al@@ ous .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves George R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , much about the subject of abuse has been reported in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger be charged with any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
none of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment of sexual abuse has been and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a choir leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
what is the value of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ pup@@ il R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had timely re@@ aliz@@ ations and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I think it ... also for really absurd , to assume that ... Bu@@ gs have opened in@@ sist@@ ent or clear@@ er or even more than in relation to their parents , dor@@ mit@@ ory leaders , confidence teachers etc .
that talking with him about sex ... is un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report conclu@@ des with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the student and / or their environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , so Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of every citizen .
it cannot be accused of having prevented it from being prevented or brought to an adver@@ t .
therefore , there is no reason to associate a good name with these atro@@ cious crimes , as it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that reporting everything is mixed and bl@@ ended into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is , in fact , clean separate : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as , we say once , other alle@@ g@@ ations .
the report also covers inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also for four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the conductors of the Cathedral .
all the terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were quite schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ined and mal@@ ign@@ ant , all occurred at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have prev@@ ailed .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on that , like most witnesses pointed out , the subject of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; conditions .
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : indeed there was discipline , but there was no sa@@ di@@ stic force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report conclu@@ des that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories are connected to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger systematically shut down the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even re@@ produces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school he will continue to practice the punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended penetration .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , when testing pun@@ ishments were banned in Bavaria too long ago .
before that , they occurred in a legal gray area , as each of us probably knows .
it was difficult to estimate for him , where those concerned might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the per@@ missible limit has been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is just not true .
only in 1980 the test sentence at schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is claimed that it was un@@ fair to apply the current ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about histori@@ ans about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger to assess the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the princ@@ ess is right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the usual routine .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally worked up .
but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all that had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear @-@ fig@@ s and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has returned to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mein Bruder des Papst &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of a test sentence also come to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told from his perspective , since the dom@@ spar@@ ks played only one side role .
nevertheless , I did not mean by no means that he carried a strict reg@@ iment there .
but even that must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand for un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ class , true cultural amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons alone one makes from rebel@@ li@@ ous boys not even big singers and before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in conversations with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and again and again as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep faith and sav@@ ory person , from which one cannot imagine that he could only do a fly .
I regularly get to know how many former Dom@@ sp@@ ines still today , 23 years after his exp@@ ul@@ sion , regularly contact him , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strict with them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he en@@ riches their lives and brought them near@@ er to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely resp@@ ectable person , to which they still look at and that they almost worship .
and please , once again clearly : everything that you propose to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is most un@@ fair , a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now the anch@@ or@@ age would command , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
