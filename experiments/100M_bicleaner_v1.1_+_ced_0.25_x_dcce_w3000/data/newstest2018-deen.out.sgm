<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows who had to get exciting times because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but that is precisely why it is very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the big picture postcard, more detailed maps, so-called Urpositionsblätter, were incorporated for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying management between 1810 and 1864 and originating from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army officer occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops were finally deprived of the peace of Lunéville from 9th February 1801, today's neighbours, who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian Map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian Vermessungsverwaltung." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The data sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison before / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is sub-mail which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was drafted, so 1877, in the city of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Lower Saxony are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian Peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing as fields - at first glance: when zooming it appears a small-piece card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered pieces from the so-called "primitive recording" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots there are no more farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of the current district Au-Haidhausen, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "on the Gasteig" or "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at Auerfeldway people once locked people with insanity.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich-based district" "" "Irrenanstalt" "" "was created" "" "On the Auer Lüften" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Gudd led the institution - that psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>

<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>

<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a salute chapel from the Middle Ages were once held at the Marienhof, where this day will take place and on April 5, 2017, the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn regular route takes place.</seg>

<seg id="50">"" "" "" "civil Rights" "" "publishes the travel warning for Missouri" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Committee for the state of Missouri, which should enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents are present in the whole state and be noted here," stated in the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as enforcement authorities of the state, which are disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to release the travel warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that people pass." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racial offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the voyage and was taken in custody by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri Attorney General, where it is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware of what might happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready to bring chewing money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which ranks the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had adopted immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherman Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right graveyard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the CDU local association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">First of all, Markus Schwendemann gives insights into his business, in which he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many juveniles stored and accommodated in five apartments Feriengaste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest" "" "is for him the alternative market for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaste is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the" "" "elementary importance" "" "project as" "" "elementary" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area provides a lot of work, much needed to be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and the topography here," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not lead a bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the areas could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they can continue their operations," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised because of their support</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the fence, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The storage area therefore amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of 71 500 Euros was promoted by leader, a quarter of which contributed to the community of fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of soft fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "explained Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiss stood firm:" "" "the best foods are produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of soft fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the enclosed area should not be togable (slope increase over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the forestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 Fishing Project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels is currently running, which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The area of disclosure corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals for drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller accuses not the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and Liberty Imitors would have loved him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he embraced its significance, and in particular the importance that was attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to enter into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom which illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to, which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "it is about the contemporary response to the shocking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "" "your potholes, your poor, / your oppressed masses, which yearn to breathe free, the burning waste of your rich coasts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict, because of the importance of a statue, is part of a wider political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who advocated to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the feminine embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty will not invite anyone but rather an early neo-conservative, which brings the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh hit here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a matter of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elusive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not supposed to lighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are Medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their captain speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>

<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home championship.</seg>

<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the papers struck him for all, from domestic politics to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He smiled with the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of doing so at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivol, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction to "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary chicken head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockage of persons who come to the governors "side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid by public money dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Sprecherin Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hasserie-filled people who play the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans of Catholic faith.</seg>

<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cloak labels and to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>

<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 Years St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery areal in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16th, at 16.30.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius site is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the Sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors tumours to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini emphasises:" "" "it is a unique village jewel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in written documents: count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it with the Vogtei" on Magister Eberhard by Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Tumour mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a marvelous farm, to which the church or the patron saint was right and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As emerges from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, beside the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which today are still recognizable in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the magnificent settlement centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating from the period around 1600 underpin this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval property law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied himself with a pastor, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">In doing so, the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Largest of the two are barbbled at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but later had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were inserted and the bell components were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops moved near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the deaths of listeners.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilary Church broke off.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834, a storm broke the church tower and the half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was aborted.</seg>

<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-sener households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re will invest around €20 million.</seg>

<seg id="682">They work in a volunteer year right at several places.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I have already worked at school in the open day-to-day.</seg>
<seg id="686">How are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Crowd: it's a beautiful, wide range that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, so a belated volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How come that?</seg>
<seg id="691">Crowd: I have made Abitur.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a building engineer, let's say, successfully broke off.</seg>
<seg id="693">I recognized for myself that it is a falsehood for me and I want to do something else to work with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what do you do.</seg>
<seg id="695">Make a social year, there is an insight, as you can see how it is on site, at the focus maybe also, really.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it so?</seg>
<seg id="697">Crowd: I collected some great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">I will study dual study, probably make a social worker training in Jugendamt Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.</seg>
<seg id="700">Isn't it unusual to have several different locations during the Volunteer Service?</seg>

<seg id="702">It always depends on where you make your FSY.</seg>
<seg id="703">It is possible to make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">With me it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was partly in the OGS, so in the aftermath.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was the right thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out.</seg>
<seg id="708">Anders als im Bauingenieurstudium? (in german)</seg>
<seg id="709">Quantity: well clear, here it is not about calculating static.</seg>

<seg id="711">Whether a refugee, whether a teenager, who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.</seg>

<seg id="715">It is an area that gives a lot.</seg>

<seg id="719">The UK education group Pearson said on Friday that will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut their dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome pressure with which the company is faced.</seg>

<seg id="730">The statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital at the airport Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh, is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="732">According to the United Nations, there were at least 1.662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.</seg>

<seg id="737">Correspondents say that in Kabul the suicide bombers in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government, their policy and especially in the call of President Ashraf Ghani.</seg>

<seg id="760">Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer, be this additive.</seg>

<seg id="765">It sees behind it a concealed subsidy of already wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">This is not the case, because with the purchase of the area one does not give a grant, but rather get a real counterpart marketable in the case of doubt, is the counter-speech.</seg>
<seg id="767">Staigner's motion to accept the resolution appropriately finds three proponents.</seg>

<seg id="908">The end of the building is planned for October and it is certain that the schedule is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a vault of concrete, covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4,80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, she has now come to the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>

<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the northern side has now received a 1.30 metre wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a constraint, which is also used as an operating route.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday an 2.20 m wide bridge cap should be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway will run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that these are prefabricated elements, a patent by the Schramberger Company Dietzo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special fingertip sensitivity has required the laying of cables through the construction work in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fiber cable where many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished at first.</seg>
<seg id="927">For bridges between the building yard and the busdriver in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.</seg>

<seg id="948">In the hall there are about 200 listeners who wait for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the Vice-President Beatrix von Storch hold their speeches.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How to influence the financial rules of football on Neymars relocation to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymars Weltrekord transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the guiding organisation which monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair-play rules launched by the UEFA in 2011 mean that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars relocation to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">With security, PSG can easily make money, so that Neymar will sign up and bring it to a galaxy of other stars, given the support of the team by the rich family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may apply a lot of money to the acquisition of players, but have to counteract with legitimate income sources, which allow them the break-even point in their business-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini following his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively deceive and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"" "" "" "during the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million." ""</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the Presidency of the Presidency in 2015, his successor of Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare off excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "certainly FFP isn't dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause from Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the funds for the next five years can be reported to EUR 44.4 million in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 met the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG was awarded a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which later was lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overboard their financial supervision by blowing up their income through companies that are connected to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a cataract company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly this happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar via payments from the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">"" "" "" "however, PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar World Cup ambassadors are going to be easily figuring out such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators." ""</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive every attempt to avoid the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that the 2015 / 16 segment achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of EUR 542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expected Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS related to Qatar's last ownership." ""</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit the 1,000 square feet apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architect and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel works are quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on one another without having to bend us." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it's not just about building a simple platform, but to put steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow him to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went inside," "" "explains Erfan from the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is important, so that when you push the door, it is very easily gliding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day, you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the bottom size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials giving the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love yourself in the electric sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square metre numbers of something standard in something quite astounding.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Indeed, like Joanne, you might choose to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers struggling for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in an argument because of one of the biggest real estate Imperial Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former Director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clear how their property and their assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate about the separation takes place at the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There she founded Westco jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for US $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and the De LUTIS portfolio now includes offices in the town centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centers in the suburb.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Following an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - was described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominating personality" in the De LUTIS family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul amounting to 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the apportions proposed by Colin have left him with what I considered the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - including Colin, as Paul claims to have excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but raises Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he is hoping to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the case with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen in the late 1950's and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeansshop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group of companies. Colin claims that Mark has paid $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark are, Paul says" "" "about the conditions of their financial separation become bitter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin kept himself very backward, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of television stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin answered via SMS to say" "" "I really can't say much," "" "because the case is before the courts." ""</seg>
<seg id="1383">"" "" "" "it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior staff on his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to fix: bad information falling into the president's hands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring its mediate.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry for an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to be persuaded," "" "said the former election officer Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping Trumps's Twitter habits under control, according to six former election campaigns, insists that his personal media consumption involves a steady engagement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that slumps" "" "Twitter habits ever" "" "was" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign commissioners know something that we don't know for others - that trumps may have included tweets without their intervention even more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that have not sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff managed to keep him away from him a few times, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a white house, composed of competing parties, try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - quite busy with this history - reported in May about the predilection of the advisers to provide the president for strategic reasons without any doubt.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former trump officials say that trump is able to react to negative press sections such as a volcano, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he insists on finding out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February when someone announced a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet-Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been banished from Twitter for shamans or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has found false allegations in the past and has voiced it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started to ask staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective as a more effective manager, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still aspire to influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.</seg>

<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all, Freudenstadt's Mayor Julian Osswald was defending the hotel location and spoke to the house at that time.</seg>

<seg id="1520">Das condemned the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The large colossus, heavy and 5800 square kilometers, is now driving north and will probably take two, three years until it was melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest iron gigs that have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">However, as far as climate change has played a role in the fall of the iceberg, it is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakdowns in the region for around 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It always grows further into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe was disturbed by the balance of waxing and abomiting a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelfeis is crumbling there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet is under suspense and can fall apart if a piece is broken down at a key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it produces after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the Schelfeisen leads to the fact that glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow far more quickly than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly raise the sea level, but only in little measure, the British research project for monitoring the Antarctic (Midas) writes.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth biggest Schelfeis of Antarctica after AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it stops regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the iron shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">"" "among scientists it is controversial whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will be growing again or coming back in the long term and possibly collapses, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "" "our models say that it will be less stable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not trace the demolition of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, in recent decades many skinned fishers of the Antarctic Peninsula have been crushed.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decrease in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In the last 50 years the Antarctic Peninsula warmed around three degrees and tamed to the areas in which the temperature increases the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, the circle day has endured 41 new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Some 620 applications had to be recorded for the places in vain this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">However, the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increasing demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are still 50 unoccupied places with Mettmann.</seg>

<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented to the inside and outside, show concrete measures for cross-entry and involve an educational offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, Leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common request with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He did not care for a big surprise for a long time when he publicly challenged the recruitment cap and startled the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be checked, which enable an exit from the municipal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the circular administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the affiliated towns - should strive for a" "" "Haustarif" "", "so people." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than it actually foresees collective bargaining for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently strictly dictated, increases or more money exist only if you switch to a higher level orientated towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>

<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned that NGOs who use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean have warned that they cannot continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," "" "said Home Secretary Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turiner Daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Jugend Save', because their squad had effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has been in operation for a year, refused to express itself to detailed allegations of the Italian Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, the saving of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area at the moment," "" "said the organization in a statement on the social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge any accusations that are currently collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had monitored the boat from 'Jugend Save', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that his crew takes off inflatable migrants, which are delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one meeting took place only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's case, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overthrowing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must first of all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been declared to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>

<seg id="1594">In the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply over the last few weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "over the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""</seg>

<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest from Wachenheim was a welcome bonus.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream levels.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between, there were always longer ascents, for which long trials were rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and Volksfest Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Once again the lookout point reached a lookout point, connected by "flown" Trials and moderate ascents.</seg>

<seg id="1632">Ingo FROBÖSE also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For Professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical responses that can be found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he presented himself as an artist for fortune telling cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the sixties: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures stand in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits at the drawing table, works every day almost ten hours.</seg>

<seg id="1789">For six years now he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his characters.</seg>

<seg id="1791">For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which should come to the cinema wall in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="1792">"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," Mordillo says.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">Lavender is declining due to the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and because of the disease passing away, what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, have great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the service life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small chicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cades, and in very dry weather there are so many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts not only for holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">"" "Eric Chaisse said:" "" "instead of having very long plant clocks with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened." ""</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office that were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal pains suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the paylist of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest of violence, and throughout the country the bodies are frequent, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has been in office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection following attacks and threats, and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, her editor and her Inspirator von Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Special Attorney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of killings associated with drug trafficking and organized crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodov they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are immaculate and although the terrain is now more obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we know not the Why, we distrust all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing to silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that one or more people are shot in Sinaloa every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums of drug royalty that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken by the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all there was the publication of an interview with Damascenes Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed vein members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez to leave Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, who had published the same story to leave the country for its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the problem of drugs," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, wherever she went.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living" "", "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV." ""</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce-Team misses Valdez, the fun-bird, who was able to curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love for the routine of his destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>

<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer in Sinaloa, just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no cell phones were allowed. days earlier, Spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were instructed by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen that the governor himself was not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since reporters have gone to the mountain scenery, where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce licked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of former well-known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé on state expenditure concentrating on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter came from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who owned the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the entire century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Journalist Miriam Ramirez snatched a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist for the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>

<seg id="1891">This day the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gain international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accuses the authorities to spy on journalists and let them move because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">"" "" "" "it has since been asked to be re-divided by the government because it is concerned that their anger has violated their objectivity." ""</seg>

<seg id="1944">Although the shade of the counter is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>

<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaurier was subjected to a real battle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have to have been the Cretaceous Age," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to study the animal on indications of his life, including his conserved Darminate to find out what it had eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably farther inland farther inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that today the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early chalk time." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just beat a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge diodes, carnivorous dinosaur, that stood on two legs, penetrated the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the upholstered dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hips.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3.000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that protrude from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the panzerte herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater reimbursement of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the skin-bust still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of conservation is as' rare as a profit in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>

<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which resemble themselves almost imperceptibly - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year-old prison sentence, after being publicly classified as a secret diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Becoming resemblance (a matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and a pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg embraced the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, as someone could look with these genomic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white self-ie in which Manning visibly sits unwell on a driver's seat and carries a platinblonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette mute and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when they received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while they were in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg said at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned Muse have become unequal briefs, who in the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would transform the President's judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually just a few days after the book was published, Mannings released release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to fix the rigid divisions he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">"" "when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" "" "things are going to happen for a certain reason." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to "automatic splitting, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological ways, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take along is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novels.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as she emerges with a free spreader in the hand from the discipline barracks of the United States as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nation-wide human-hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford which was sought as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday for Wyndham Lashe (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the Cook County Court.</seg>

<seg id="2165">Lashe has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>

<seg id="2192">Mutko's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with Russian sales office at the beginning of the day, Smirnov reported problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is on waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, offer specialist groups and demographic groups, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite leaders and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>

<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture must remain so that you won't be the next one involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups, such as Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion worth more than $118.7 billion, following the finance-technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent bad behavior and detect, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convercent companies can send customized "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth-maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the Court of Public Opinion gathered the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its staff poorly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, Convercent has been used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been identified by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair trainees will be identified and addressed more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>

<seg id="2231">Companies began to harvest Ethics, Values and Employee Commitment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both start-ups." ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">In February, Convercent received $10 million in financing in February by firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more obligated to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach Renditen when their portfolio companies are running well. companies are running well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If third-party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks staff after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and motivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 comments, you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies who have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow people, ask yourself," "" "Have you really heard me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you don't care about it, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate measures the same day when a problem about Glint is reported, so saved.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often," "" "said Mr Sharkey to publish his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern scoutfits have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human responses that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also" "" "adjust" "" "his robot accordingly and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing as many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "who would like a stepford woman to be progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">State-of-the-art sexpuppen have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," "" "warms the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed to conversation or she can" "" "be" "" "in the mood!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive feminine characteristics, the allusions to rape, if you take a step towards Frigid (i.e. here: opposing) Farrah, troubled a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" "" "is it on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR recognizes their increasing popularity, they nonetheless remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what sickened out of the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market is allowed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time in which women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who boasted to have sexually attacked women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphic images, the worn-out body and the hidden eye, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, when it comes to its "personalities," the robots are no real wives.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companions or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no placement or background story, nothing that points to independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are counterfeit slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the 2017 statement: maid service</seg>
<seg id="2424">Mumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney as the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a certainty of the trump era that the political divisions, polarized by the U.S. voters, have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposedly supposedly to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less has been noticed is the power of lumps, families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-looking poet who lives in Chicago and has long been engaged with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With trump in the White House everyone knows whom she knows, including the republican relationship that she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and very peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is in a further context that it entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by trump, but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalisation" "" "and" "" "trump," "" "we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his maids will no longer be cast off." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">"" "however, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans normalize" "" "normalized" "", "which suddenly appear as an epitome of reasonableness in comparison with his standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of madness - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in fact seem to be very mild in comparison to trump.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousel of the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals are twisted to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-loving music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the subject pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park carousel is still a weird magical experience, since here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, during this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing, while I wearied the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrist, which he suffered from prison authorities in a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Due to murder, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder after an appeal to the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day when he shot them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius maintained that he held his girlfriend for a nightly intruder, hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appease this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Prosecutor's Court said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year." ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food cannot penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result from this.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice bearing a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of proteins in proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have made a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of l. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes tolerant, less inflammatory bowel-limb if the same system also affects people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a sort of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same parent, which had been kept separate, had not had this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiologists of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they did not develop an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers concluded L reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleansed out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophane values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan informed that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect l. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Maine, a fire brigade from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House military office requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his supervisor, the vice-president for aviation.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight.</seg>

<seg id="2891">"" "the final report on the abuse scandal at the" "" "Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "continues for discussion." ""</seg>

<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all that had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the outcome of the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment? lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were abused between 1945 and early 1990 "with high plausibility" victims of assault, 67 domsparks sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accused, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories are connected to him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal is relieved at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the incidents of violence practice at the" "" "Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "reports a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many pupils highlight his" "" "humanity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a choleric and perfectionist who became tangible when a Domspatz did not bring top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as your biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is ever present in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">There are just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly exempted from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The principals of the pre-school also took place outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, it can be accused of having experienced it too late or not having taken the first indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as" "" "redemption" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus also the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to brooding.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not just crawl with chairs and threw the keys on the floor, but also distributed ear-figs and attracted too naughty boys on the hair or ears, he himself had already given himself years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents like with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced it in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, they are of course Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Originaltitel: CSI: crime Scene Investigation (# 1.01 Pilot) (TV)</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope many who have never understood him are still zealous.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves George Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, much about the subject of abuse has been reported in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger be charged with any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said a affected representative for the others," "" "Everything was very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the Enlightenment of sexual abuse has been and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even trust parents and siblings, certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">What is the value of the Domspatzen-pupil Ratzinger's role in regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely realizations and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd, to assume that... Bugs have opened insistent or clearer or even more than in relation to their parents, dormitory leaders, confidence teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That talking with him about sex... is unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report concludes with the very clear result:" "" "that the student and / or their environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, so Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of every citizen.</seg>
<seg id="2943">It cannot be accused of having prevented it from being prevented or brought to an advert.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to associate a good name with these atrocious crimes, as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media a lot of" "" "violence" "" "was read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking out" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that reporting everything is mixed and blended into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is, in fact, clean separate: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The report also covers incidents from the period since 1945, thus also for four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the conductors of the Cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were quite schizophrined and malignant, all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on that, like most witnesses pointed out, the subject of" "" "preschool" "" "tabu." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: indeed there was discipline, but there was no sadistic force.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that" "" "many victims" "" "estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories are connected to it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at most, the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger systematically shut down the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out this," "" "that in the pre-school he will continue to practice the punishment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended penetration.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when testing punishments were banned in Bavaria too long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal gray area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult to estimate for him, where those concerned might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit has been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test sentence at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we are talking about historians about the" "" "pitfall of anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger to assess the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">"" "" "" "the princess is right." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the usual routine.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it is finally worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger because all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, so ear-figs and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his" "" "Regensburger Zeit" "" "has returned to Georg Ratzinger in the talks with you for the book" "" "Mein Bruder des Papst" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of a test sentence also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, since the domsparks played only one side role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not mean by no means that he carried a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even that must be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons alone one makes from rebellious boys not even big singers and before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger in conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger and again and again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep faith and savory person, from which one cannot imagine that he could only do a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get to know how many former Domspines still today, 23 years after his expulsion, regularly contact him, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strict with them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he enriches their lives and brought them nearer to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectable person, to which they still look at and that they almost worship.</seg>
