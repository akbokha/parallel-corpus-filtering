a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the victim told him that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went up with him again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field m@@ all was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , divided the geri@@ at@@ ric medical department in San Francisco .

the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , informed the ABS Transm@@ itter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who formerly worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked and destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will find it painful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;ll always be in dra@@ wers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in dra@@ wers or stuck from outside labels which usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more likely to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to be married or have children in order to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as an all @-@ inclusive mother of two sons .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets the pyramid &quot; &quot; &quot;
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues sought a little change with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 year old it was a premiere .
CHI@@ O : &quot; golden Sports Py@@ ramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their celebrations , they h@@ unted in the fast g@@ allo@@ p home to the fe@@ ed@@ stuff .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and that ended the riding career as well .
on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament vict@@ ories - again near horses .
he let himself lead with his family over the plant of AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even ho@@ ot for photo .
it was the first time in Aachen and therefore also the CHI@@ O .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Sports ilfe was handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala , the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid .
awards l@@ acks the sympath@@ etic sport@@ sman .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes bay leaf , champ@@ ions @-@ tour @-@ player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
a long one is the 18 prize winners of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has promoted the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,@@ 000 Euros equally .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ time US master &apos;s winner was admitted to the Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports on Saturday .
the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmitt , the gymn@@ ast Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander Pus@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmitt , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the jumping rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sporting events had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company went to the Spring@@ field , where the Lav@@ azza prize ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept far to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons und Tr@@ umps Wirtschaft@@ spolitik in Vergleich : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP &apos;s trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are in tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton are a basic , rather philosophical distinction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump is in doubt rather small and war@@ ns how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to best@@ ow the economy to death and to regulate death , he says .
he himself would be quite different , claiming tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely withdraw regulations , and he is fighting for a far @-@ reaching fiscal reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
that is why the taxes for the rich would increase , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost wor@@ dless .
the democratic applicant even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical tea party wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so on tr@@ ump , even party internal discussions could come to an end .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and raise coal mining in the US again .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to termin@@ ate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with its investment program Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand the Renew@@ able Energi@@ es and asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ aci@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are to be paid better then , for example Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what tr@@ ump is going to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage has to go down , then he says he should not be changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics say to him , that the deficit of budget would only be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman fled has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is a part of women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looked curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she not@@ ices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene works normally .
until you speak to Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oultry .
they live in the North of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard against the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who comes here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them as hope @-@ bear@@ ers to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al secre@@ tly because they do not see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , perpet@@ ual mur@@ ders , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run this continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs for example demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
who believes that as soon as they arrive in Germany , B@@ ahr is telling us .
even here , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this means that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the North of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodations only for them , requires B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich within their jurisdiction , some answer no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is no such thing in shel@@ ters of the governments .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ eing women are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower Saxony and Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are in some community @-@ shel@@ tered floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women will be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack the privacy or will put together men and women together , it can lead to perpet@@ ual violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women is in the study .
how much the women feel this protective need can be read at the rush that there is in the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have spoken around that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new occupational training measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dep@@ u@@ ties of the Assistant doctors called on their union to appro@@ ve new employment measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more employment measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that there were ministers who had agreed to deal with wor@@ ries about the contract .
in July , assistant physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was released on Twitter on Thursday night , the Chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently remained &quot; to solve problems , which led to the agreement that the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Bureau has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and challenging new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Bureau has submitted a formal petition to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating working campaigns that begins at the beginning of September .
the dispute led to the fact that assistance doctors made six times this year , the first overall inci@@ dents in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leader of the B@@ MA Assistant doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which were still held before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announced an official end of the eight @-@ month war of the words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated ball@@ room of the St. Petersburg palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed nar@@ ro@@ wer and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if something bad would never happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I seemed to be rather the opposite of his enthusiasm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introdu@@ ctory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was kind@@ led .
Putin informed and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater since it was committed by a supposed friend .
to re@@ build the eyeb@@ row becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media held a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed as if the Turks had to blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria &apos;s areas controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this veh@@ em@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting was held only because Putin received the exc@@ use that he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he has been almost enth@@ ron@@ ed with a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at last month .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is reduced by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ um@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ ended rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian imports are allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the continued gro@@ ll on the sn@@ ail emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian state of state gained a bonus that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat he demanded support for the elected state organs .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once said : two countries that viol@@ ate themselves from the West and feel bad and are now alli@@ ed .
nevertheless , in spite of the public reconciliation , there are always great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support oppos@@ ing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents spoke at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even stri@@ pped the subject .
the president of Turkey was deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect dism@@ iss@@ al when NATO member Turkey ki@@ cked off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s Executive Board , the R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office roll .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
ROSS Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during this time , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it supported the international sport with millions of pounds to sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to clients in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock market record will change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private customer business that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investment brand and the brand among which our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we are not pursuing global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer continue his Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of brands , because how do we focus within ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chief Executive Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we said that we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , focusing on customer needs and not our own , I think , one will see many changes .
we can re @-@ launch these brands , so I think the time has come .

I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori perc@@ ei@@ ves the che@@ er when he brings victory to Pre@@ f@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the ste@@ ep@@ le race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ minute winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 vict@@ ories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ winner had 4.@@ 4@@ 93 career skills
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of Modernis@@ m and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which only a few before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma inspir@@ es fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he already had 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered a 30 @-@ year @-@ old winner in the UK , which is great .
he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an unbelievable jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount

a whole series of major tournament winners , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived an air@@ plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties at the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strong point of strength to de@@ fy his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 50.@@ ten years of age .

Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tallinn in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is ( in Russian ) that he later became the chief executive and Chief of Staff of the Gover@@ nor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s the main task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made Moscow secre@@ tive .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ant and works as he was for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , aired on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff was with@@ drawing at his own request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few are convinced here - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is the result of a sort of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - appe@@ al@@ able posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he most trusted .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally , Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced his dism@@ iss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his dism@@ iss@@ al .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I rep@@ ent the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be published according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who played before in the sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been there since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and have put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans that you can only wish for a series .
the planned char@@ isma of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles around fish , which landed in garden in Ban@@ ff
one of the inhabitants of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fishes could act as sand@@ als that were sp@@ iced out of a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cros@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 incl@@ ine rop@@ es .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
economic Minister Keith Brown ref@@ uses to visit the site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cros@@ sings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tri@@ cky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
all in all , nearly 79 % of the total bridge are located at their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks is getting a concrete casting for the deck today , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ stru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting high@@ - and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the gap in the north or country side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs approx . 6@@ .000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
delicate , because the toler@@ ances on which the team were working were tiny - they were only a few milli@@ meters on each side .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortune to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown off by their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station crashed on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alert after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties swimming in safety while their boat evolved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and presented us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones rescue station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck@@ ily the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ oy with no life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the Co@@ ast@@ al rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue @-@ station
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Jones : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have happiness un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , however , it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone today wo@@ ke up about these men .
seriously injured - man cho@@ oses his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police informed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal belong@@ ings .
instead , the Al@@ co@@ zed Ta@@ o@@ ist cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hands and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old dem@@ ol@@ ished the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother .
this then al@@ armed his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the streets they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old sho@@ ok his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who builds Braunschweig budget apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be taken a lot more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig is going to lose almost 1300 budget apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD will propose a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prac@@ tical Concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next Council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but quar@@ rel is programmed .
first and foremost , it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD president Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas must evi@@ ct 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the low @-@ priced apartments can also be built in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as 20 percent of housing as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development program that will cost millions and still have to be financed depends on incen@@ tives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ DU wants to make as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder jobs for investors .
regardless of that , so Brat@@ mann , a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market .
if the action plan is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of additional 1,@@ 300 inexpensive apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , the city &apos;s planning should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about getting apartments back into the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
on one stroke the problem could be solved .
for in the west town go out to the year @-@ end dead@@ lines .
around 1800 dwell@@ ings could be brought back into the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing corporations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is increased again dras@@ tically , one remo@@ ves from the objective of so @-@ called mixing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no need to focus on a concentration of social weaknesses in just a few neighbour@@ hoods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens expect there will be still movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ schke means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the C@@ DU has to go to the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
the fact that teenagers and child no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade .
at Pok@@ emon Go it &apos;s about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then video games and most recently on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a carto@@ on , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s were created ) .
like many phenomena of pop culture , interest before the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly at the beginning of July .
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go out with their smartphones to the outside and look for Pok@@ emon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( over a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the chair and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person returns each day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch that tra@@ cked 35@@ .000 users , the Washington Post recently reported that within two days of the game launch , the number of tra@@ ce@@ able people who exercise every day 30 minutes , increased from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
whoever drives sport regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people even make new friends on the hunt .
as usual there are also m@@ ür@@ k toys that have to compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should I do ?
it has made a breakthrough .
even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will take time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with active players in the real world and help many people on hunting , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the New Testament
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es ist auf alle das im@@ mu@@ n .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the ground .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast appeared on Thursday for a multi@@ battle title and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American female Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the floating beam during the individual campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ it is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American who wins a multi @-@ fight title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation , the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success puts it in the same le@@ ague as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ it has dominated the last three years of her sport , 15 world champion@@ ships - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of am@@ bition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it awa@@ ited her a final test in Brazil , a competition that did not go so much between Bil@@ le and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American female Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g each other after they won gold and silver during the individual campaigns of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ a won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as a excl@@ am@@ ation mark during the f@@ arewell ceremony of the team coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi .
although it insi@@ sted on the head to never have planned the future during its long journey , it is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which includes their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip to the gymn@@ asi@@ um , trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became the force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost a competition competition , a winning series that will last as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led through two turns , the picture sm@@ elled .
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ ken and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ ten holds the world championship title - lau@@ tered .
she repeated again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and sat on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man gently embra@@ ced her as she expected her g@@ rief - pure form@@ ality - and tears poured on red bright red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book of book , became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ af@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old male capitalist , which is called &quot; Grand@@ ma , &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her floor exercise she threw the public treas@@ ury , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ it , the rapidly expanding twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in series mur@@ der@@ ous when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl have been shot in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first series mur@@ der@@ ous event of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the killer fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting has led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed and two others injured in his@@ panic residential areas within four months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ ll@@ ac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same killer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to its injury and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about shooting , which aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the factory of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 year old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his cont@@ empor@@ aries , Ed@@ mund micro@@ zep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto did not know during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t manage that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t let myself go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has om@@ itted it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and you were told that Ed@@ mund could never see her under certain circumstances and that he might not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that the people still do &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with help of an assistant .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor cra@@ wl until his third year of life and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is slow progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund has imagined for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some notes alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto re@@ members the emotional price of an unknown future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I have been asking for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect them to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the c@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls , floo@@ ding causes cause to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency room on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more ra@@ inf@@ all .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards stated that civil servants are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were multip@@ lied .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a demanded tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service leaves that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches might fall in rain .
in Southern Alab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday as it continued to rain in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will likely reach a record level over the weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the nearby batt@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a stream @-@ down@@ ward floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger , since these rivers are only slowly flowing into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday .
rescue teams still got people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , climb@@ ed over night .
he said that he would have warned him another step @-@ of @-@ man who lives nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water flo@@ wed and flo@@ wed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a stron@@ gh@@ old of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the ob@@ stru@@ ctions and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that all three would have res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quickly spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities consider ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann an observer en@@ ra@@ ged near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been largely su@@ cked by the ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and floo@@ ds caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and Te@@ aching Committee in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a attacked 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches that were now both floo@@ ded .
the forem@@ an of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller stated that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals washed up by the floo@@ ds .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond emergency accommodation was set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to return , they will return to their houses again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two dozen streets were closed due to the floo@@ d@@ water and sand sa@@ ws were provided for the residents who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a hand@@ ful of houses were reported as floo@@ ded on Thursday , but no reported on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places I have never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pun@@ ched by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves sho@@ ot@@ ings in Philadelphia
the police inform@@ s that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified it for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents agreed that Brown suffered several shot injuries including in the lo@@ oting , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was at the hospital in his transportation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered cri@@ tically in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the broad@@ c@@ aster that he is likely to recover .
he would have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical condition , reported the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just determined whether one of the injured men could be the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there was a bon@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ wed the crime scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that this is clearly a continual battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , were poles .
so it seems to have given several armed milit@@ ants who were very active , &quot; said police officers Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ ra@@ cket in the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I present in the gymn@@ as@@ tics union in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first of all , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din and Ma@@ di@@ son Ko@@ cian , which is Kath@@ o@@ lik@@ in , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among the female gymn@@ asts has been an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America rejo@@ iced .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion@@ ships Simone Bil@@ ar , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected , yet master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American who won gold in an individual multi @-@ campaign event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the peak of this kind of sport , but that &apos;s not what sports classes do not look like in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ di@@ son to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gymn@@ asts in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that Tur@@ nen is an expensive sports and gymn@@ asts primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued in any way .
the majority of these turn@@ around are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs the Tur@@ ner get their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both exercised their athletes since they started gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we need to be inspired by the municipalities of inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access exercise training .
I founded my gym of 20 years .
during my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international champ@@ ions .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sports .
tur@@ nes develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it &apos;s the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to get interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ di@@ son for this genuine depic@@ tion of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the olymp@@ ic team gol@@ ds and thanks , you were motiv@@ ating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amend@@ ments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 resident doctors who voted for election rejected him .
in July , H@@ unt plans had unveil@@ ed plans to for@@ ci@@ bly introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and would be dam@@ aging any further delay for the employees and patients .
the first assistance doctors are supposed to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of un@@ related watch periods .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chair@@ woman of the B@@ MA Committee on Assistant Do@@ ors shared last night in a communication with : &quot; assistant physicians pointed out serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will heat the current staff crisis and it will be to treat all doctors &quot; justice . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes by talking to the government should be involved and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the result of a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt made only last month about that his door would still be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt has to act now , raise the vibrations and address the concerns of the assistance doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistant doctors made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work camps .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13,@@ 000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to give medical doctors to the stri@@ ker chain .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amend@@ ments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA would like to receive a better week &apos;s re@@ mun@@ eration for the 54@@ .000 Assistant denti@@ sts who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS staff , called on the assist@@ ants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work Camp@@ aig@@ ns do not achieve just little , but have already poll@@ uted teams and service providers and prepare patients , car@@ ers and their families only wor@@ ries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we talked to the Assistant Secretary and responded positively to the concerns about the tut@@ el@@ age and the W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stri@@ es .
employers hoped that continuing positive engagement to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training programs , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding the compliance with the B@@ MA in November , February and May were .
the £ 2 @-@ per day@@ - drug that can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after recommended by the authorities to administ@@ er this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS Reg@@ ul@@ atory Authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS Reg@@ ul@@ atory Authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suff@@ ers another heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls , which form floor@@ ings .
when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that blocked the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ots sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and c@@ logged the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ ère , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able .
the NI@@ CE draft bill , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60mg with a daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the NI@@ CE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or a stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
fear of renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effectively reduces further heart attacks and stro@@ kes for people who already had a heart attack .
by a pro@@ visional recommendation from Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this .
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness makes election fraud in Muslim areas flour@@ ishing
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year on dism@@ iss@@ al of a government report about corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread elec@@ toral fraud in Muslim communities kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored as a devast@@ ating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les attacks the police , elec@@ toral ob@@ servers and the town hall to have ignored the evidence of elec@@ toral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now an anti @-@ cor@@ rup@@ tion@@ ist , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off bands outside of elec@@ toral ca@@ ver@@ ines to protect in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a badge in order to prove their identity in elections .
at present a vot@@ er must only name his name and address .
the report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they give up their vote to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should obtain more protection , Sir Eric says .
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or work@@ groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against elec@@ toral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the current mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be removed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way , &quot; and that he had put his critics to silence with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic charges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious obligation of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation in which one person was chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he particularly wor@@ sen@@ ed in the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in which the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including guiding principles to prove their identity
in his report it says : &quot; as evidence has been pointed out that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored such conduct because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ no and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations in order to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists are editing post@@ cards to stop &quot; re@@ ap . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election directory used for immigration and social @-@ fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing according to your ID .
do not use remo@@ ve@@ able ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
perform systematic reviews of the nation@@ ality of a person to make sure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to automatic correspondence .
ban that political activists manage full post@@ ings and envel@@ op@@ es of letters .
the police give the authority to set up shut @-@ off stations .
a change of law which alle@@ vi@@ ated an indictment for in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Act 1983 ) .
photography ban in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees usually en@@ force that voters alone go into the elec@@ tive cabin .
Sir Eric comes across the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case no criminal charges were imposed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election court has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for due to a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty - according to the high demands in criminal proceedings - guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ out controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election regi@@ strations of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court case in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , but the wor@@ rying and conce@@ aled spread of election fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler Doppel@@ gän@@ gerin and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger by Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are over the French cycl@@ ist Pauline Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot out of the border and band , which proved to be an impressive double @-@ member of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic @-@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only one to have Gold fighting ath@@ l@@ ete , who has its own famous dual @-@ go@@ ers - at least not if you can give faith to the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are fli@@ ck@@ ering at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ gerin on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter , after pictures , on which he looks cl@@ an@@ dest@@ ly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got ins@@ anity in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no big simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focal point : the striking simil@@ arity between British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big expressive eyes is said to be a Doppel@@ gän@@ gerin for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
a gear up higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Schauspiel@@ er .
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver med@@ alli@@ sts Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and blond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans , an athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt .
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and Dex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the Dex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face @-@ form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own wonderful , big smile similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis about the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at dr 4x@@ 200m Freestyle s@@ quad@@ rons ou@@ tra@@ ged viewers of the C@@ BC live transmission of Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; like M@@ ief did &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he finished his own opinion at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Freestyle s@@ quad@@ ron .
Mac@@ don@@ ald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS comment@@ ator team to give more &quot; paint , &quot; could be heard say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese Shepherd has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , as as M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ mar , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the s@@ wimm@@ ers 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were sho@@ cked by the sound and the language
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ Far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Do@@ es the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; like a pig has died ? ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows in the final 4 x 200m Freestyle s@@ quad@@ ron for women : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese Shepherd has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came fast and hard , in which many people asked him to speak .
Twitter users didn &apos;t come back when they heard how un@@ si@@ bly By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like raci@@ sts . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC program , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment about a swimming performance was broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times in the people who responded to the news via Twitter
&quot; &quot; &quot; the comment@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scott Rus@@ sel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC copied and added ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed fast and delivered a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that they were broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on the show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald exc@@ used in the broadcast and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made following the women &apos;s s@@ quad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympic programme , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ stered how she looked at it , she pulled out and put her back to the shelf .
she continued to browse and rehear@@ sed four pairs of pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the landmark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone where the woman tried the pants before she put her back to the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in the business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she d@@ anced again and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of pants from the delivery , pulled out her own tr@@ ump pants and pants and tried them .
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discre@@ et place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Oskar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they re @-@ pulled back the pants which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that her did not fall asleep again and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to bo@@ ther somebody to watch someone - or think about the person who could possibly buy the pants she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you think anyone would take shelter with someone who had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to withdraw clothes from the sale after they went - what &apos;s just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9th August at the Folk@@ stone branch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question have been pulled out of sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons of arms
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it a little safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to rot@@ ate the sk@@ e@@ wer for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
if you approach you from behind , then you should turn around as a first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon then between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knee in the bar and rot@@ ate while the aggres@@ sor cl@@ umps against pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move back@@ wards as she directed the weapon on him .
with att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and rot@@ ate them , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot .
at the same time shift the weight to the weapon and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving back@@ wards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it prepar@@ es Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est thing to do your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and thro@@ ws of a serious test - by selecting some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k donated his course to a euro bill , a rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a jet@@ ty of a pull toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before emp@@ t@@ ying any object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show off and to show us what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; resulted in some surprising results .
the thought to lick the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the res@@ ili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ways to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task set its immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was definitely righteous to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its sample line showed a lumin@@ escence number of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ escence number of fresh washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick after their lumin@@ escence was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve ger@@ min@@ ated in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dir@@ tier than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let us call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking only about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who was direc@@ ting the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tast@@ ed some of the things I have instru@@ cted him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie . &quot;
of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others , in which it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of all sur@@ vey@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well being of g@@ astro@@ intestinal bacteria and 58 percent said that they may at least occasionally use products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
aso@@ cial family destroyed in front of Del@@ og@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an aso@@ cial family left their social housing after a del@@ og@@ ation of £ 50,000 , because they terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had aff@@ licted holes , wooden pl@@ anks were rough@@ ened , gar@@ bage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was decorated to the walls .
the family res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that it now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the management at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons , who meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ licted , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all sle@@ epers , in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , strikes and floo@@ ds included .
Skel@@ lef@@ one , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be dem@@ ol@@ ished under circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood @-@ pl@@ anks were torn apart .
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the streets and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall Housing launched her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the property after giving them a extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily surrender .
the del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tens neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not afraid of anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we could not sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it was administered by the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house , to which the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the municipal house , gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the final step of considering the Corn@@ wall Housing .
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extremely and their actions had to be horri@@ ble for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the Police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will don@@ ate con@@ sol@@ ation to some neighbours and con@@ veys the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ og@@ ation on the floor
workers of the house administration will now have to swe@@ ep away gar@@ bage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ bet earned a fine of money after having found himself guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in commercial law .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after having been without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will del@@ og@@ ate ten@@ ants who do not cling to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the Devon and Corn@@ wall police informed that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not obey the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without accus@@ ations , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that continues to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal moved to panic after flying a ti@@ ghtly military jet beach
sun@@ an@@ bet@@ ans in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of her life
a portu@@ g@@ isi@@ es@@ ches P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air Force Air Force deployed an unbelievable storm flight
the air strikes reported that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no security risk was present
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a ti@@ sing jet cr@@ ashes over a full beach .
dramatic video foot@@ age showed how the military plane flew almost close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers ran up , understand@@ ably , to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without seeing what was going on through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic fly @-@ by in social media , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really flew low twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ uno Arro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve just been surfing and it felt like the plane fell down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on air@@ plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said the jet flew lower than usual due to poor visibility due to bad visibility due to nearby area fires , but the air strikes har@@ med that safety at no time was je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed .
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , with four people on the island of Madeira to death .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly as deep as possible due to the circumstances - strong fog and smoke - which restri@@ cts his view
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worry about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona fought on Sunday for the first step towards the first title win in the new football season .
the Catal@@ ans join the Spanish Super@@ cup in the du@@ el against FC Sevilla , the back@@ game climb@@ s three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Double@@ winner must ab@@ stain from Ne@@ ym@@ ar with the sub@@ jug@@ ated cup@@ fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning European le@@ ague champion , who with Brazil den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament .
furthermore , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre is missing .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , thus clari@@ fying the demand for Bar@@ ca at least in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen set up the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique gave a clear decision on this until now and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other cont@@ est@@ ants .
before the first mandatory play of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
even at the 3 : 2 in the trial against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince themselves .
Sev@@ ille again has the 2 : 3 defeat after renewal in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with up to now eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
MA Long in an own le@@ ague table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5.@@ 4 ) .
thus the world @-@ ranking @-@ first took the &quot; Golden Grand Sl@@ am &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title one another .
it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five Rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
MA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between sentences and time @-@ outs , they had no co@@ aches .
they had with@@ drawn to the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches have I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang out there only a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma it didn &apos;t develop the anticipated stir@@ ring match .
but nevertheless , nevertheless , there were plenty of breath changes to be seen .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German Euro @-@ champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Russians had drawn up a ri@@ b injury , after that he had to settle in a medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to settle with sheet metal .
the Swedish Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) had become in a similarly high table tennis @-@ old Olympia @-@ V@@ oted .
Donald Tr@@ ump räum@@ t ″ große Probleme ″ im Wahl@@ kampf ein
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now admitted weakness of his election campaign in the former Repub@@ lican stron@@ gh@@ old of Ut@@ ah .
a rare moment in which the generally large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident multi @-@ billi@@ on@@ aire vo@@ iced something like concerns like correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the repub@@ lican camp of the race , doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians , asking him for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bl@@ aming false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he again recorded his famous media sh@@ ot@@ gun .
Repub@@ lican stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ag
Ut@@ ah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June 2008 , Tr@@ ump and his assistant were consistent with the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is common for repub@@ lican candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are also endangered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview by the station CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t make anything other than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party should have threatened to strike funds for the support of his election campaign , he should not present better surveys .
instead , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans wanted to get stronger under the arms of the Congress .
heroes of the Storm ( Hot@@ S ) - Sum@@ iko
the I@@ OC wants to establish a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after an attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach at home .
the International Olympic Committee announced to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials told that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine test to the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the team leader Ken@@ ias of the dop@@ ing inspec@@ tors .
the IA@@ AF World Association has searched the I@@ OC for information about the case in order to rig@@ gle their own investigations into an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the results of the investigation and the following measures of the I@@ OC , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and issued and signed up as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the sample and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Ken@@ ias Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accredi@@ tation of the athletes , who stood on the list for the training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ ich was de@@ duc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against money @-@ payments in his country .
according to media reports , he should have been arrested at his return to the airport of Nairobi .
in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing cycles , Kenya has been under special surveillance for a long time .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target checks presented by the I@@ OC before the Rio games , it was previously noted that especially athletes of Kenya and Russia were taken into sight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law was passed a few weeks before Olympic start .
subsequently , the W@@ ADA Kenya received from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing comb@@ at@@ ants are compliant with the W@@ ADA &apos;s rules .
Kenya is regarded as a big runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports on ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing drugs are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
I@@ OC member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar study in Kenya , as he had employed in the Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it could be proven that in this sport art was surface @-@ covered and systematically studied .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Maria a youth room .
in the Orchest@@ er@@ graben the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the ven@@ ez@@ onal conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she rec@@ alls a mel@@ anch@@ oly to her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
she is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is an enorm@@ ously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli backs the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a southern tem@@ per , a fire , a passion and also a cheer@@ ful approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly top@@ ical : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time they went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as they were at that time .

K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the attor@@ ney Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family learned from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air@@ strike in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the country @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks connected with it to go into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other girls from the east of London stepped into an air@@ plane to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ ana &apos;s family was told that she married an I@@ SIS milit@@ ant in Syria - and became a wi@@ dow within a few months .
rei@@ d says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in case of election victory at Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton will nom@@ inate Jud@@ ge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will ap@@ point the successor of the dec@@ e@@ ased judge on the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he hadn &apos;t talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge for the U.S. appeal court for the District of Columbia .
RAID said , Repub@@ lic@@ ans block the Gar@@ land nom@@ ination , be mini@@ ons and hel@@ pers of the repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated Donald Tr@@ ump is in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women and for Men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats Magazin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with the photographer David BEL@@ LE@@ MER@@ E to publish a 1970 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us earlier this year that his n@@ ac@@ kt@@ magazin of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes , since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do that for women .
apparently he believes that the calendar also does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must return to the presentation of timeless and classic n@@ ak@@ edness , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release to publish the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community reck@@ ons with mass ev@@ asion
&quot; anyone who does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish community Germany expects in short term with tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with a few hundred thousand protection @-@ seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany if the Erdo@@ gan regime further comb@@ ats the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government already out@@ lasted a few months of Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were on the run inside Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the dist@@ orted put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to rest@@ art in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of Verb@@ and@@ sch@@ ef compl@@ ained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this Erdo@@ gan wants to raise the shift back to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also C@@ DU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Verb@@ and@@ sch@@ ef called for the federal government to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is held against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a quality trailer anni@@ hil@@ ates teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; anyone who does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular@@ es , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , President of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks already faced the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people and therefore almost 29 percent of all people who had been granted asylum rights ( 39.@@ 625 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , there is no need for war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum is entitled to the Basic Law exclusively political , i.e. from state @-@ side , individually persec@@ uted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go to where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they have understood .
2021 will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
it is not stupid as yet : summer holidays , heat and ag@@ itation w@@ rest@@ ling - that bit@@ es itself .
the locals who are to be convinced by the elec@@ tors are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so are not allowed to choose the country day .
there are practical problems : during the holidays car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers , the posters hang up , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribut@@ ing fl@@ yers and counting on voices are only lab@@ orious .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass over the people over themselves .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / C@@ DU coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the C@@ DU in surveys .
it will be exciting , how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition break@@ through@@ s .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as it already did his legendary word kar@@ st predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ DU with its Spitz@@ enk@@ andi@@ daten , the Minister of the Interior Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if at the wrong time the right place makes election campaign .
she has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major declar@@ ations ; German Chancellor Angela Merkel is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the C@@ DU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once again .
otherwise the Nord@@ ost @-@ C@@ DU does not aband@@ on the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , so means co@@ co@@ king , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noticed that on the land it is br@@ ittle , that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , hardly available in the expan@@ se of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the C@@ DU spokes@@ man Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must go where it w@@ eh@@ ills , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Social Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partners C@@ DU ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the Land@@ tag .
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and spend their campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise green elec@@ tors go on track search for native vocal folds among the holiday@@ makers .
Silke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ es straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it still beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;

at the speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 8 o &apos;clock , there is praise everywhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything quite well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be moved to the south as scheduled at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also the reci@@ proc@@ ity of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation drives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site on Monday to the south is ander@@ ed and the block of the asphalt road in Of@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has been restored , the traffic situation within the place has been relaxed .
the citizens can now travel from Of@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 back on both sides .
the traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Florian King , responsible for the engineering management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ hau@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ land had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eping paths were looking for and rather trusted their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ ch@@ ising .
since the speed limit@@ ings were not respected , the congregation increased the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant sur@@ ges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed himself on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been made .
the fast @-@ speed was on the way with 77 hours of hour in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has gone further , however , it has become more quiet .
for the business@@ men on the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is now open again .
business@@ men do not like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation in them led to sales cre@@ ws , everyone lets you look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the deal@@ ership of Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum light drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running company is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily captured are the bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; hit hard . &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we must be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he deci@@ ph@@ ered sales revenue to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far over 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking had its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss the half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government President Jörg Schmidt received a request from G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , otherwise the restaurant prof@@ ited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now it must also bear the dis@@ advantages resulting from the rehabilitation .
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other county circles where things have been handled more generous .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
that other regular guests are now seeing less often due to complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else .
that his tri@@ bal @-@ release comes back after the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crisis with BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
all the time , in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are scre@@ wed to laws .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère proposes a big security package .
but what has a potential to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the labor@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Internal Affairs at the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they over@@ claim no one .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as the Minister of the Interior he was lying on the results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Wu@@ er@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security agency should take care of the cra@@ cking encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU specifications on passenger information and arms legislation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second trial for proposals that have not been done with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and push ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the C@@ DU man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything , which is not a chance for the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas are presented by the Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans fast @-@ charging methods for dep@@ ortation and more possibilities for det@@ on@@ ating people from dep@@ ortation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check out their smartphones in advance and reveal social media accounts for a safety check .
in the case of toler@@ ation for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to put some even worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or disc@@ ard their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are political and legal .
some people also have an un@@ balanced and un@@ answered questions .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of toler@@ ated , for example , the question arises : what has this to do with security and terror ?
yes , says the Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ inations of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ er@@ zburg were refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and things that people were deeply concerned were not cl@@ inging at times even in election times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal security is enorm@@ ously moved into focus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elec@@ toral struggles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in a position on internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days , it went up between the two parties .
only a bel@@ ated contro@@ vers@@ y about the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security @-@ political ideas collection of some Union interior ministers in which the leaders also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al from the double nation@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also glo@@ ws in con@@ cili@@ atory sounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he keeps nothing from a revers@@ al from the double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have called for the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
making you new is not useful .
and with a bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns .
whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is indeed &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it is only necessary to show itself .
there is a lot of things that could cause disputes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ long internal security issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sister ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel signals the willingness to talk and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen got off lightly .
despite diesel sk@@ il@@ ding , the delivery numbers increase worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
in the recall action , there is confusion about a term .
Volkswagen will start deliveries to the second half of the year .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can forward a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand VW weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and res@@ um@@ ed the total sales as the company listed in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market Germany , deliveries declined by almost a sixth .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was given a purchase post@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the EU &apos;s withdrawal from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust f@@ umes were first cold , there is also a minus to be@@ ech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
head of Group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to forward a sales report from January to July .
1.3 per cent more vehicles produced Volkswagen at this time , around 5.@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen manipul@@ ated exhaust tests with a software .
in Germany alone , Volkswagen is calling around 2.5 million cars for the conversion into the workshops .
in the course of the conversion VW , VW , that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after re@@ arm@@ ing vehicles , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance do not give any deteri@@ oration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car manufacturer offers the customer a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate for the conversion , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now weighing its German customers a guarantee for w@@ asted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW @-@ representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my commission of inquiry and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Federal Minister for Labour Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the retro@@ fitting no wor@@ sen@@ ing takes place and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not how it was called in company circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers come to a workshop for example half a year after the conversion , and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in the interest of the customer , it is important to avoid that any other damage , which has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , comes to an in@@ secure regarding possible warranty regulations as it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich austerity in future criminal interest - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who want to park 40 million euros on paper money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and sees it no signal : ordinary savings would not have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; store banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fee covers the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund as of September from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on sight deposits or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 in the future will cost 400 euros per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been holding 40 million euros for quite some time , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he cannot toler@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the poll@@ uter principle , the cost is now given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just letting the cash slip into the posit@@ ors of the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers had understanding and changed to other investment platforms .
only few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the EC@@ B causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to wear alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their charges for bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy , credit cards , or transfers .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nation@@ wide compensation for deposits , but the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele that is somewhat luxuri@@ ant by the fortune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she sums up money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ b@@ anken und Raiff@@ eisen@@ b@@ anken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go into negative with the private client is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is tough , and it thre@@ aten the migration of investors into competition .

destination plates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lon@@ ely men middle @-@ aged love plates .
before comm@@ enting on the comment section , consult him under the p@@ seud@@ onym Non@@ Alle@@ vi@@ en@@ &apos; men of Mitt@@ ler@@ age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed re @-@ emergence of vinyl records is not attri@@ but@@ able to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer group .
it is also not a hor@@ des by collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers rather retain their feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while in the middle of a busy street in S@@ oho run a modest gray suit and let me go wild before I stop , keep my hands and make a certain determin@@ ant like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ ho@@ s is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill in the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic plate specialist shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ eram@@ an to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observing them .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , from S@@ ister Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him at home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford to buy when she appeared and once again bought items he sold when he was young and striking .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought probably was too young to buy it to me , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he agre@@ es that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and love to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray also believes that many customers he meets may apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and can see to buy back their old records .
from the conversations I have conducted , people usually have emp@@ tied their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of adher@@ ents to the record grounds of a particular age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ on@@ ica to recognize that record stores have a soo@@ thing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z some of the older customers assumed an imp@@ etus to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some plate fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to retreat to the stability of familiar noise cl@@ amps , from items that aw@@ aken happy youth notes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal with mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff deri@@ ves from a pile stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet stopped .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , do not own a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I pu@@ zz@@ led through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone recently came here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a radio ring@@ ed record , so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more produ@@ ct@@ able , less musi@@ cally @-@ rich .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly enter .
opp , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ ant audience when I enter .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ pack pop instead of experimental jazz p@@ am@@ pers from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such a diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lon@@ ely but nag@@ ging mental trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ach when standing next to somebody for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for several minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale .
it rather makes a shop window as a large purchase .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ ded si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I seem to print the jeans @-@ hot@@ line , I watch a group of young age girls who are group@@ ing for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cros@@ ley Record Player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential boards for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these objects could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ ho@@ s for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even if my inquiries showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they , at least in record stores in S@@ oho , let them take into account the large number of female collectors in the reality , plate shops and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the bum@@ ble@@ bees through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets by plates while they steer clear of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fake moder@@ ator , who raises nothing of middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders .

French court re@@ jects supply of demo@@ lition of stores in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle where thousands of refugees live .
during a trial this week the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be fu@@ elled 72 pro@@ visional shops to sell , sell , offer bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few Euros in pro@@ visional restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be dem@@ ol@@ ished because they would constitute a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and that could be a fire and health risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the pro@@ visional shops and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people operating the 72 pro@@ visional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; were absolutely tra@@ ce@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than simply feed people living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meetings between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by ra@@ inf@@ all was the jungle Book Kids &quot; Café des Lag@@ ers , which is operated in a non @-@ profit way and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as a consultation on the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants cher@@ ished on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new@@ com@@ ers over the summer .
despite Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant

he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to me , it is frank@@ ly difficult to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyse in peace , which reasons would have led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
at the World Cup in Qatar in October , Martin actually wanted to compete for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at all that we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers must adapt to the next generation of speed meters : in different federal states , including H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash units are being tested , which are to be effectively transferred to Temp@@ os@@ ystems .
the fut@@ uris@@ tic retro@@ active trailer of the Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden company can be used , for example , at accident areas where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example on motorway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary tem@@ p , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary bl@@ aster for compliance with speed limit .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measuring operation , the case data are transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time over several tracks .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans after time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the high @-@ sk@@ id state you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
in order that it is not simply stolen , it is lo@@ wered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also disappear in a safe outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the car@@ ver from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also bla@@ ze with the new technique : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain wins Silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class colle@@ cts gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji emp@@ tied a master class in the handling , side st@@ eppe , back , line run and rough strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was won by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the strong defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but independently of that , Fi@@ ji had beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in the form of this form .
it could be a comfort for GB - but will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head trainer Ben Ryan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago , under Ryan , they lost every play at the Adel@@ aide se@@ Sev@@ ens .
here they only lose one .
this fl@@ ap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started mar@@ vel@@ ing and suffered from the attacks G@@ Bs from fun .
it felt for captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co . , as if they were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ dov@@ au passed over in the corner .
with four minutes of playing time Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he changed .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a h@@ ass@@ le T@@ ackle of Mitch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third gate , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua l@@ ete a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ launch and there was still more than a minute game time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med to the line to make a gate .
the conversion took a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB is still studying .
so it is also .
GB conducted fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the nasty gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova to a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a tou@@ ch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South Se@@ unters , whose fans sang , flags , and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the fi@@ j@@ is caught , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and GB ki@@ cked out cr@@ ushed in the grass .
earlier , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks back in the first half , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Teams , secured the winning - and therefore the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the coach of the trainer to ro@@ cket victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inate gold than with these games and that &apos;s what you want .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard drives , which enter history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when they rowed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without a tax @-@ woman , the first women in the history of British sports who set such a benchmark .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 39.@@ er un@@ defeated bet , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ l@@ ete sliding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the style of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference , and no one was more helpful than the coach who did not know whether he would survive this day at all when diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
if you do not do it , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that was the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I needed to go back soon .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and running around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suff@@ ice .
that &apos;s how it starts .
the rowing of itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , her first thoughts came to Williams who spent a nerve ra@@ ving in the morning to talk more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was the captain of the Royal Ar@@ till@@ ery reg@@ iment in an action in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that &apos;s perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I and Helen and Robin have worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race over the last five years .
the couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents couldn &apos;t keep up with .
even during the last 500 metres , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to not let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to make something crazy .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver will have to appear on a wedding next week , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to compreh@@ end that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .

behind all this stands Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband collabor@@ ator , of which 28 years as managing director .
he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , based in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 15@@ 0,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the congreg@@ ations are the municipalities of Kirch@@ horn , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
the current president , Breit@@ brunn , mayor Gertru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller was appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended themselves from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities , bud@@ get@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , she called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the high capacity ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial re @-@ upgra@@ des of water pipes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not given a stand@@ still and I have always added new innovations , because water lives and drinking water is the most important food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practi@@ tioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe for nit@@ rate lowering in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for that he received a lot of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , on the one hand , praised Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the pipe break at the high container at Kirch@@ eis on January 3rd .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the towns could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is open to the au@@ ti@@ stic of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she ought to die .
however , the eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago was well forward and now lear@@ ns privately in New York , where there are the best therap@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something for two years when I sang to La Scala , he rec@@ alls nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the bass @-@ bar@@ it@@ one Erwin Sch@@ rott .
she is now married to the tenor Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship at bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10 : 45 am and wounded her deadly wounded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called upon us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator was on the run , after him was publicly punished .
meanwhile , Sven S. might be travelling by car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , mus@@ cular , brown @-@ burnt and has a bald head .
in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him .
but it is a few years old .
in the meantime , the man has a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the gun with him , so the police .
who sees Sven S. , should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police are talking about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship of relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
the competent police in Lübeck did not want to provide information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but they confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing machine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more we do not say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special operation ando ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick für Deutsche St@@ ah@@ lindustrie
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional cost in millions .
financial bur@@ dens that the industry threatened from the eco @-@ current promotion are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Transi@@ tion on the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy production in the German steel industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Federal Minister for Agriculture , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Frei@@ tag@@ ausgabe ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to ask gases from the blast furn@@ ace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry showed an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent will be replaced .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission to produce electricity .
in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely written .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the Emis@@ sions@@ recht@@ eh@@ and@@ els , climate and employment targets are to be aver@@ ted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy when the world &apos;s largest producer of China threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers throw in Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imposed import tari@@ ffs show effect on imp@@ air@@ ment , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have risen .
it is un@@ clear how sustain@@ ably the price re@@ petition is .
the German branch of the Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp industry remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost re@@ ductions .
at last Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to excl@@ ude closing of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the economic association Steel ran on Friday .
after a short increase in May the produced amount went back to the second month in a row .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output .
community , Spirit , Health : singing is good sen@@ iors good
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp accompanied her entire life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in Leh@@ ra@@ mt he occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emoti@@ onally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and overall living , she says .
by the way , she does something good with her health and mind .
since singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German Sen@@ ior@@ en@@ liga .
most senior singers sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular collabor@@ ations , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dis@@ solve in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler means .
for this sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who demand his lungs on a regular basis , even in everyday life are not as fast as the b@@ ust .
even if it &apos;s about getting the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Sen@@ ioren @-@ Organisationen .
in the older generations , common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , it explains .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening to songs in elderly people aw@@ aken many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , demen@@ tia suff@@ ers from long back events .
in singing , the head will also require special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s own voice and a given rhythm and adap@@ ting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone are not just focusing on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler means .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I am long for something , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent , advis@@ es L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who h@@ ears when a sound goes wrong ?
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
if someone from the circle of acquain@@ t@@ ances sings in a senior choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the area .
whoever wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ as@@ tical choir can turn directly to the congregation or the Church leader .
many Sen@@ ior@@ ench@@ ants can also be found on the Internet .
those who have no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors to help with the internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to any age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as males on the scre@@ ams of the young
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect the thro@@ ws of cat @-@ cats on adult animals has .
to their surprise , the Mi@@ auen did not let the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the gra@@ ining degree of cat @-@ cats at the che@@ wing of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te von K@@ ätzchen , who are in great need to find out how scientists have found out of the Veter@@ inary University and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
cats also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and heavily excited young animals for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous examination , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ cri@@ es differs with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy .
a total of nine adult male and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of MH@@ H .
they were played for a cry of little ones , taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of stronger @-@ excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who didn &apos;t have their own offspring , responded to the cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they swi@@ ft@@ ly turned to the loudspeaker , when the calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens were playing .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop@@ e with the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have already repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men on baby sounds .
some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to inf@@ ants , whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Super@@ cup &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey an arrest warran@@ t has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey , an important football match will be held in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
the government , the everyday life of normal vou@@ chers , should not be affected already in the suspension of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it will not stop before the football .
against the former Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the Prosec@@ ution issued an arrest warran@@ t .
according to this , the South Coast who has now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kü@@ r should be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency held at first for 90 days is still valid until October , indeed , the life of most Turks , however , has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country declared Erdo@@ gan to end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially fans of the B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clubs are traditionally not among the friends of the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks en@@ du@@ red in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict ref@@ usal of military put@@ ties .
even fans agree - no matter if their hearts beat for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially time to arrive to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne figure demonstrated its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine in@@ soles in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his club .
in the Final Game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory bull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FAN@@ ATI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and his team secured the cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ O in the Champions League the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in SO@@ UND Li@@ g it was only in sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have done this and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as the year was better .
above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 season dig@@ its as a per @-@ li@@ g @-@ li@@ g guard .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the time of AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez , bor@@ rowed by AC Florence , had to be announced after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club manager F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the storm would have to be ready to reno@@ un@@ ce around a third of his worth 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay the salary at Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin has been locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa should not start in Rio .
other over@@ taken athle@@ tics sinn@@ ers can laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swi@@ mmer in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had lam@@ ented her starting right shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was bar@@ ef@@ oot and bu@@ sted with her start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
there was a sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scene : with an open smile she was still proud of the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was fixed that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience collap@@ sed into a hur@@ ri@@ cane .
but there are still numerous other sport@@ s@@ men who start the Olympic Games in Rio despite dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staffel / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was locked two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is over 100 m in 9,80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the greatest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ fold world champion had to sit in 2010 a six @-@ month lock after taking the pain with Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Championship from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively to the banned anti @-@ stimul@@ ant drug Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic susp@@ ects the occasional intake and was closed six months .
the four wid@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staffel / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and 21 months had been closed .
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , poured out Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ fall , Belarus ) : hardly an ath@@ l@@ ete has been recognized as many medals afterwards .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was found testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympic silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title of 2006 for testosterone abuse .
the bronze medal , which also recognized the Olympic Games in 2008 , was returned to CAS due to a verdi@@ ct of the International Sports Court .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world ranking list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the world record scientist and Gold fav@@ ori@@ tin has only been tested positively in May but must nevertheless start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , hints were found on taking a forbidden dietary supplement , the lock of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency W@@ ADA fell mil@@ dly and ran already on July 13th .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Multiple T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the foreign ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered s@@ inter@@ ed wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again .
she planned her home trip for early September .
whether from the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on , Austrian citizens are also un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
in the approximately 200 kilometer south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two bombs .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ änder@@ in was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
on Friday morning , two explo@@ sives went up again and another person was killed according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular beach resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a municipal employee .
according to the authorities in a flower bed , the explosive was put into the air in front of the territory of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g demanded several injured on the south @-@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee free day ahead of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to manifest itself to possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ bing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , stated that the attacks would not occur in connection with the Islam@@ ist revol@@ t movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one rather assumes that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military j@@ unta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities would have kept secret information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however , they were not informed of the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still un@@ clear which group behind the attacks .
the police instru@@ cted their officials across the country to rein@@ force security around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not focus on tourists .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the strong bom@@ bing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
high security risk ( safety level 3 ) ended up for the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its en@@ vir@@ ons .
after confront@@ ations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need to travel to these provinces .
increased security risk ( safety level 2 ) paid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ unta .
this gives the military huge influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to sti@@ ff chaos while the country faces stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military unta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , maintains itself to have led the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok , a stop at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine was killed 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has come into the vision of the Federal Office for Constitutional Affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several national offices , also the constitutional conserv@@ atives in the Con@@ federation have placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ t@@ arian movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cl@@ ues for aspi@@ rations against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vice @-@ president Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aßen of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , immigrants in Islamic faith or from the Middle East are treated in an extrem@@ ist way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing of French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is opposed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multic@@ ultur@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional Protection in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - are already observing the &quot; identity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a real advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda should appeal to people emoti@@ onally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there were reports of contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any knowledge .
for the constitutional complaints , potential contacts of this species are only relevant to a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons who are extrem@@ ist , changes its direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist .
the deciding factor is whether such people will have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view of the significant increase in pen@@ alties and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard .
but we have seen in recent years that there can be law @-@ terrorism structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Old School Society &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frei@@ t@@ aler Gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may well be that further legal groups or small groups form attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist moti@@ fs .
however , a German @-@ wide or European @-@ wide control of legal @-@ terrorism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups have ar@@ isen on the regional level or in social networks .
they expressed concern that many attacks went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum are previously not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different or have chosen C@@ DU , the SPD or the left , who , however , radi@@ c@@ alised through right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympic games or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympics .
this shows the bold appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia are so slow that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transformed into a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethi@@ op@@ ian got a special start @-@ up right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries well @-@ known .
since most athletes run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names started the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity bush &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad Bo@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of Freestyle , played there .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
during the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i caused media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to walk alone in a lead over 100 metres of Freestyle .
f@@ rene@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before Olympic and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been testing whether they will ship their self @-@ developed street sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets will be delivered to other companies .

G@@ FR@@ P leadership resig@@ ns after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its head Matthias Hartmann .
the re@@ tra@@ tions suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair by Vor@@ stand@@ sch@@ ef Matthias Hartmann will become even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
G@@ FR@@ P CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the board of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert is already dischar@@ ged from the Supervisory Board with effect on September 12 .
as early as September 1 , the management board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , managing director Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , agreed on the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor for Hartmann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the review , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differ@@ ing views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hartmann has been on the Gf@@ K &apos;s tip since 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are still not to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become uns@@ atis@@ fied at some point .

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
on Thursday in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) eight people were injured when an accident occurred with 43 senior citizens .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered serious injuries , divided the police with them .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , report@@ edly had to devi@@ ate her data from a truck that was partly on the opposite track .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade fre@@ ed the passengers .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ seen travellers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Pe@@ w@@ sum Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the latest veter@@ in@@ arians and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the price per cubic meter se@@ wage is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the new se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of previously 2,10 euros ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ denberg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ e@@ water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a per@@ tin@@ ent calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , with the approval of the household by the Land@@ rat@@ samt Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was noted that for these wast@@ e@@ water installations sub@@ li@@ abilities were opened .
based on legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is oblig@@ ated to operate the facilities in a cost @-@ cover@@ able manner .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ denberg and Zul@@ tenberg must go deeper into the wal@@ let .
the rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of Administration Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee , a new calculation of the fees for the wast@@ e@@ water systems of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or sub@@ missions from the previous calculation period may also be compens@@ ated .
Schmidt thus founded the engra@@ ved fee increases in all three se@@ wage plants with relatively small facilities with a very low waste water treatment , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the low distribution basis for example expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the se@@ wage volume in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , due to the age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses , the recovery period fell in a considerable amount due to its age of refurb@@ ishment and repair costs .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for pupp@@ y meals , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ denberg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt proved that in the wast@@ e@@ water plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage .
in the pump@@ ing plant Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old convey@@ ing systems had to be over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed from the ground up and after nearly 20 years of operation the first se@@ wage pond had to be extended , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge was disp@@ osed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to be able to keep the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance costs and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
stone houses made it clear that during the low waste water waste in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; fully sm@@ ashed . &quot;
Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the wast@@ e@@ water systems has been spar@@ ed during the last 20 years .
the situation for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ ari@@ ous in the long run , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wast@@ e@@ water association could not be extended by these facilities because they are defici@@ ent institutions .
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first above zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the average annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index compared to June 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 amounted to -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in July 2016 : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; -@@ effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature has been critic@@ ised
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is Ani@@ me @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to bre@@ eds .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be a painting of a Roy Licht@@ enstein .
the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all faul@@ ts get to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past where they were accused of promoting the Black@@ face promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested some users a filter that gave them sl@@ ot@@ ted eyes , false teeth and ev@@ apor@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics call a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow face . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y pointed to a greater problem that the company has a diversity of diversity .
the news and in@@ dig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it had de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was meant as a hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as carto@@ on by Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the fil@@ tering of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the Ani@@ me comparison .
in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American student , whose twe@@ et was widely distributed across the photos was that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting , and the least said unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very resistant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow @-@ face has been drawn into the descent extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ de .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in .
and Snap@@ chat &apos;s big audience of young people - who are different in terms of race as their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ chat fil@@ tering creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much harder for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it was previously the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asking others to do the same .
in an essay for media and in a telephone interview , she said that ra@@ cial controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices in Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu also critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors who work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat mostly has left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man the company recently hired a personnel manager focused on sub@@ represented ethnic groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , Z@@ hu said she will let her Snap@@ chat account be closed and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership wron@@ g@@ ly mistaken I@@ SIS intelligence service , establishes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence services to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the actual states were allowed on the ground , reported a committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the pro@@ visional report , created by a Task Force of the Repub@@ lican members of the army committees , secret services committees and the military budget , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their appreciation to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ Com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence reports that were typically in@@ geni@@ ous by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders reported regularly a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism when they had allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened to Cent@@ com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , repub@@ lican member of the House of Represent@@ atives , stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct references to that government sp@@ ik@@ es under Obama have given instructions to change the reports it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as I@@ SIS or I@@ SIL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , comments and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than it meets the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com was publicly known that a military recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul , the second @-@ largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command &apos;s leaders changed intelligence reports to reduce the risk of I@@ SIS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after them being admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be comple@@ mented by more detailed insights while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ com &apos;s reports are held by the Secretary @-@ General of the Department of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ lican Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence reports on I@@ SIL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the highest @-@ ranking democra@@ t in the committee , Member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compens@@ ated mor@@ ality among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for differ@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats indicated no evidence of interven@@ ing in the White House at Cent@@ com analysts in regard to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specific political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of the congress were published Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor who was taken up by Cent@@ com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , gave in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on Congress reports , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions of the question of a successful air@@ field under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest ass@@ essments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of dis@@ agreements of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a piece of writing about how the former government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to specify government agencies that contrary to the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State did not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these pro@@ visional refin@@ eries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger Commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Legisl@@ ative for its exc@@ essi@@ vely positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK stands before
a day after she had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American squ@@ ad team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games were supposed to represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember this ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will take the heavy Dutch little longer out of the way that will lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vort@@ ex by their success story , four years after they landed at the last of 12 places in the past London Games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey bats in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the National Game Director of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which she and her team got everything .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the working capital in London , which we now have .
we have the ru@@ dder completely torn around .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ man in the first half of the game with a draw@@ back from the close @-@ up area .
India had gone into play without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept playing from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she accomplished a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and threw the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guided tour .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline
wherever you are , as late it is , there are the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel continuous and inevitable , a fast relay between competition and aspi@@ ration .
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which is passed from the bra@@ cel@@ ets to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the gymn@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neigh@@ bor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the conflict between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time in the Olympics and being a wom@@ b with di@@ m@@ ples , could have been among these known names that would have been sent to Prime Time , built up by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising if he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even f@@ encing .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic Tramp@@ oline .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade , the sports that are not generally accepted : air du@@ ster shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign long .
but if I should make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ oline .
although the tramp@@ oline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was perceived so spar@@ ingly for the last 16 years that many who had asked me didn &apos;t know that it was a Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never won a medal in jumping on the tramp@@ oline and had had an ath@@ l@@ ete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ oline jumping has some out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds more fitting for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a clo@@ wn school than that for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of the Turn@@ ens and Di@@ ving , the two sports that essentially un@@ ites it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring vi@@ ctors jump on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to turn a number of falling movements ( turning , real and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
they are rated according to the official Olympic programme according to design , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes to the finish , sometimes to the top and down@@ wards on the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the bas@@ eline , but also in the TV transmission another cour@@ tly destination : the world or the Olympic @-@ ords .
the goal @-@ oriented aspi@@ ration is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel at looking at these games as a bit ti@@ ring .
the tramp@@ oline offers an at@@ emp@@ ause .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline jum@@ per is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly upward .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no tac@@ tical attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant abo@@ lition of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the Women &apos;s Quali@@ fication and En@@ dr@@ ills will take place on Friday afternoon , in the stream at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of an afternoon blo@@ c on both days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the att@@ acking and objective of male ath@@ l@@ ete - as the male American Tur@@ ner recently proposed , according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air rin@@ se , new fan community .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia came to violence against the government .
witnesses say that ump@@ y prot@@ esters were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police in shooting .
is Ethiopia just to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in the last few months protests against the government sha@@ ken the country and expanded in more and more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was inde@@ struc@@ tible .
witnesses pointed out that police officers fired and killed on ump@@ y un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos on the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security guards hit young people with sho@@ cks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now calling for a detailed investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the head of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethi@@ op@@ ians to fight terrorism beyond the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced , with dis@@ si@@ dents being effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert .
but this could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in Central America .
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use to stran@@ gers in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
following a wide @-@ ranging election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front or the O@@ g@@ aden National Liber@@ ation Front , which have been forced more or less in recent years , use turbul@@ ence and arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of an@@ kl@@ ank@@ le under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems to be harm@@ less : smartphones .
in recent years , many Ethi@@ op@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and improved the internet services .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethi@@ op@@ ians admitted that they were so protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ m and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who are mainly Christian high @-@ lands from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oro@@ m of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ sei have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which constitute approximately 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was an Ethi@@ op@@ ian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly sav@@ vy in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special commissioned officers to manipul@@ ate enemies and make them harm@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime l@@ acks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he is not enjoying the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands against elections prot@@ ested , which , according to statements by analysts , were apparently dec@@ eived by the government and then stolen .
during the subsequent ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even if there were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure plan , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in comb@@ ating poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters attacked in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ per@@ ical city , led by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming increasingly common in the social media .
analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for country flights over the neighboring Somalia , although she recently reported that she closed this base .
while the West wants to clearly support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his allies to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat@@ walk &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement Obama founded I@@ SIS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump has attempted to sc@@ atter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that surro@@ unds his campaign by fear@@ ing that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would be the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication gave rise to new questions about the communication capabilities of the Repub@@ lican presidential candidates , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings out his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase in order to explain to the peculiar position , declar@@ ations that he could not have meant .
having made the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening Mr. Tr@@ ump broke back with regard to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton had created I@@ SIS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the alle@@ g@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama would destroy I@@ SIS , the Repub@@ lican candidate wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t down to Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling cargo .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech bor@@ ed .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he strongly critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s E@@ mails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the language barriers in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; according to what the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sherman , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more et@@ ched tone , as his demand values continued to decline .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was released on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is increasingly focusing attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ supporters to the uncomfortable situation to have to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps &apos;s most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , was struggling to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said therefore to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements ques@@ tioned whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama I@@ SIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors , completely wrong , and therefore it happened , because he removed the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , served by Mrs. Clinton as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed I@@ SIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ umps exc@@ use as only one further evidence that he was in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
once sold over the price of the market , Café comes back to Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a bub@@ bly café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices dropped out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie shop , which was sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people saw it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ t and Ver@@ b is now a soap store . &quot;
but if New York is a change , it is also a re @-@ invention .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new outside table , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so he@@ aders model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nit@@ ers like cap@@ ers and fried onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no beer more , but there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also driven by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliv@@ eira was such a client .
Oliv@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in former times and visited the verb regularly .
even having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb had closed , she gave a while to coffee , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addi@@ tive .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long and faithful customer since the beginning of the year 2003 .
he went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same .
&quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss watch watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and take new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he won &apos;t have a gru@@ dge on the fact that soap shop has occupied the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for clubs with the cold @-@ roasted coffee of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish residents of Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new client has translated the menu to the Polish and Rodri@@ guez said he has prepared to send her soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice bar wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the cafe expands onto a neighbouring building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed by the ground when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt told that entering the restaurant and the crowd felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rich meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a foo@@ die , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Water@@ tur@@ tle Sou@@ p .
its menu on this day was slightly more modest : stu@@ ff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man said .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;

Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh water wich with olive @-@ piece , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the rep@@ orter ques@@ tioned Hack@@ et , this was the couple for a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap , which stretches out the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as supp@@ er .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
cre@@ ws of women cook for male Fel@@ dar@@ bei@@ ter and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways the country was dealing with , no longer to be the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central theme , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
the new bud@@ get@@ ary was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods that asser@@ t c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ du@@ es , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man noted , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely ser@@ rated luxury .
unique mix@@ tures were tried out because a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen @-@ sense .
while resear@@ ching the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to the day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions don &apos;t fit together .
it was typical for many of the family recipes .
as never before , or ever since , budget econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - were the eating habits of the country .
by published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeper &quot; and the challenge of turning p@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic delic@@ acies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he sp@@ iced like the million @-@ weight man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gold@@ plated dining room and had a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was very foreign to reality .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt would have report@@ edly committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ ure his stomach .
as described in the book the hypo@@ thesis of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors caused by Ms Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt meant that the White House produced the most boring meal in Washington , but also one of the most enthusias@@ tically prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said brick , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple gave the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law better understood when writing the book - for example how she could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They made people really sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the prevailing wind @-@ bag .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and co@@ e produced a dessert which they had at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt ate for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick to give a nice name to the recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ re a little rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly , it did not taste bad .
Co@@ E repeated three times a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ bud@@ get@@ er , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bom@@ bing attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in the Assad regime &apos;s bom@@ bing attack .
O@@ mar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , which according to Bild @-@ Zeitung saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own lives on the game to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil protective guard , which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as heroes , however , he never saw himself , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me this is true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think God sees in me a marty@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrel bombs above the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb so that no children can play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image rec@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland shar@@ ks usually only come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland shar@@ ks will only receive up to 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ ks along the North Atlantic coast , in an hour it is average straight 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it depends on it , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal speeds up 2.6 km / h and is half as fast as a seal at this top speed .
this lifestyle , characterized by slo@@ wn@@ ess , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at any rate from a Greenland @-@ hai that could be 392 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life @-@ span which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist has long assumed that Greenland ha@@ y will become stone @-@ old .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland shar@@ ks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in the winter at the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland shar@@ ks .
their slow pace was so as they pret@@ ended to take six animals with a transmitter before Sp@@ its@@ bergen .
this shar@@ ks nevertheless make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
maybe they ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ avers that tor@@ ment from higher water layers down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland shar@@ ks who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Sp@@ its@@ bergen as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was 81 centimet@@ res long , while the largest 502 centimet@@ re measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
its birth should therefore lie after the early 1960 &quot; s , when atomic weapons hunt larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res of length , the len@@ ker contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , and it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
all larger Greenland shar@@ ks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lin@@ den core , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
indeed , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Grön@@ land shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , whereas the record @-@ shar@@ k with 502 centimet@@ ers is likely to be 392 years old .
that Grön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
since one of the animals with 392 centimet@@ ers probably stood on the threshold to the sex@@ ually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland shar@@ ks with the multip@@ lication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates currently .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters , is not a coinci@@ dence .
the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland w@@ al , whose bac@@ on on the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon lace , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on fire flame .
so they mature later - and al@@ tern more slowly .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal should , on the other hand , invest his resources into a long life .
building site in the double pack
the municipal council has dealt with themes relating to construction in the most recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee adopted the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently reported resi@@ dences can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ lier@@ ing- and settlement surveys were clari@@ fied and the applications were placed on sur@@ vey@@ ing , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( segment of Bin@@ der@@ straße - extension section 1 ) is no longer in the way .
the municipal council is convinced that the blo@@ wers in rural and quiet residential commun@@ e attract beauty to young families and rest@@ art sen@@ iors .
as it was called , building wil@@ li@@ ds can be noti@@ fied immediately in the town hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots the municipal council is expected to be consul@@ ted during its September meeting .
in order to satisfy even requests for res@@ ett@@ lement of other commercial enterprises , together with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year .
thus in the Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n area , the commercial area already designated there is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city on the Main has the best chances to attract new jobs and companies from London .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Comp@@ et@@ ence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether financial houses can continue to operate from London from financial markets throughout the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , for the so @-@ called EU passport , approval in the UK is sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are using large US banks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , which un@@ ites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervision EI@@ O@@ PA and the Risk Council ES@@ RB .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the EC@@ B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg leaves a large fund industry , it also cuts poor@@ ly in the infrastructure as well as Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the city is equipped with an easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial property . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
in addition , the Seine for top @-@ class commercial properties is 50 percent higher than the river Main .
Frankfurt also offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the company coun@@ sel@@ ing Mer@@ cer , the city ranks seventh , Luxemburg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , my econom@@ ist .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from h@@ epatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. counter@@ judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se the legal costs that you have ar@@ isen from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ce C law@@ suit with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the injury of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs called so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a U.S. judge covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ l and other un@@ ethical actions .
at the request of the complaint on Thursday , US National Jud@@ ge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the decree of the cost incur@@ red during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equi@@ p with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of h@@ epatitis C medicines that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck def@@ ended each other and claimed property on laboratory work , which included Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops backed by the US say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
the United States supported the full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the Democratic forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) comb through the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city .
they released over 2,000 civilians who were held as host@@ ages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters reported with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we just perform clean@@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
Hill@@ ary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , resulting in the demo@@ crats of the Democrats and their husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton cost $ 5,@@ 3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ ars ; the former foreign minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim KA@@ INE from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax statements for the past ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim KA@@ INE continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; Dr. Clin@@ tons Camp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump conc@@ eals behind false exc@@ uses and reti@@ re@@ es with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
it is custom@@ ary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations even though they are not obliged to do so by law .
tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for ref@@ using tax inspec@@ tions by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign , Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ umps special advis@@ ers , said CN@@ N that he would not allow tr@@ ump to publish anything before the controls are not complete .
tr@@ umps Cri@@ tics , among other things also the Repub@@ lican candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already reli@@ ed that his ref@@ usal to raise issues pert@@ aining to assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business activities and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already top@@ pled on the subject and on Friday published a video on the Internet , in which high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lican Tr@@ ump calls on publishing its tax declaration .
on Thursday she spoke about the topic during a speech on the Michigan State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential candidate has done over the past few decades and publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ LI@@ TI@@ CO reported that during the 1990s Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little taxes for two years , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that this could still be the case .
Bundes@@ taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here , Tr@@ ump into a meeting to exchange their tax statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said that he was also subjected to a tax audit of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump got &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not from tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons Camp@@ aig@@ n has published tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the financial statements of the 2015 Clin@@ tons show that they only paid USD 100 of their income as a wage , unlike most Americans .
their main funding was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9,@@ 000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as Ele@@ ph@@ ant protection
natural conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements in humans - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ das .
the method has proven effective and the Honey@@ reason Foundation , which already had the idea for years ago , has intensi@@ fied its promotion together with the US natural protection by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is the world &apos;s day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their setting within these communities , with much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the CEO of Honey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a communication .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chili cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is fil@@ med up to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a bang and spra@@ yed fine dust at ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der in the air .
a touch is usually already sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last option is a thro@@ wer that sho@@ ots a gold bullet fire@@ work in the air and causes a loud , bright explosion .
municipal coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or decides unanim@@ ously : no Ki@@ os@@ ens@@ ub@@ au at St. Go@@ arer The Rhine river bank
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the St. Go@@ arer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Investment Plan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of commercial companies with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - is regarded as significantly exp@@ and@@ able in the core city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the application for the construction of a sales office on the banks of the Rhine near the Rhine river bank in the immediate vicinity of the building on the Rhine , however , rejected the city council now unanim@@ ously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new tra@@ ders , but at this location in exposed locations on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk doesn &apos;t fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the C@@ DU faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director sm@@ ashed Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ selection was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; prompt - RT news
a French director with Jewish roots viol@@ ated a media uph@@ e@@ av@@ al after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre @-@ election , as the Arab guests requested &quot; requested . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel selection list .
the country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own Call Center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received was &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was cited by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large reson@@ ance on the internet in which people called the whole sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recre@@ ated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged request of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was in another post pointing out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synago@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly dismis@@ sed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; see &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not record Israel into the fast @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited one of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot;

police force tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the prot@@ esters .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to diver@@ t the students , which led to police officers and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their short@@ ening of plans .
according to the proposals of the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be converted to save money .
some of the protest participants had to spray gra@@ ff@@ iti on walls against the pro@@ visional president Michel Tem@@ er .
the latest protests took place several days after prot@@ esters went to the streets in masses to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an rose by 7@@ 0.9 per cent in the year .
since international sanctions have been lifted against Iran , the interest on the sides of Russian companies in shops in the country has been growing strongly , shared the ambassador .
Russian companies are taking existing links with Iran , while new companies are ready to access the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trade fair is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade recovery was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this year D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign representation issued approximately 35,@@ 000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , affecting the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses sought : beverage market covered in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y raid was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the cust@@ ody of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ ber@@ ed their faces , demanded the issu@@ ing of cash from the staff of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presum@@ ably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf .
how much money has been captured , the police do not share with them .
the offen@@ ders should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.70 m tall , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poor@@ ly accessible from the park deck of the Re@@ we market .
the offen@@ ders will have to be stra@@ pped in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and , from the gravel parking place located opposite the car park entrance , may be followed by the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have observed observations , which are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , should be urg@@ ently reported to the police .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the past@@ oral care unit Ey@@ ach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were met .
in order to bridge the time until the next round trip of all the mini@@ stri@@ es in two years , the minist@@ erial meeting St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were checked and one decided finally for the bishop city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the open doors of mercy on Freiburg cathedral .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ole , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Heiligen@@ zimmern arose .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m cruci@@ fix@@ ion and divided the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b there was driven by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where there was also a Münster Bel@@ oved woman and thus the pilgri@@ m path was taken from Münster .
the individual day tours were accompanied by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts in the morning and evening .
but also on the road , the Min@@ is made up to field crosses , chap@@ els and churches again and again to sing a song from a specially formed pilgri@@ m song .
the local par@@ ishes were at their disposal for the nights .

the next day , one joined the leg to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of route , had to climb around 500 al@@ timet@@ ers first and then be climb@@ ed afterwards .
the earned reward was a common barbecue in the evening at the Bad@@ wei@@ her .
after the morning pulse on the fourth Pil@@ gri@@ mage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
clearly facilit@@ ated and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at Frei@@ burger Mu@@ en@@ ster in the late afternoon and went through the gates of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was given thanks .
in the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is arrived at the pilgrimage destination by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train to Hor@@ b .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner r@@ ushes home , as Br@@ ite rings Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in Vel@@ o@@ drome in Rio for fame when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow took the anch@@ or@@ age , who had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y himself to E@@ igen . he made the legend proud when he stor@@ med at home to hit a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in London &apos;s world champion@@ ships in London , despite the resig@@ nation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ fahr@@ ers Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ d@@ rance .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement has produced a gap , the Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y conquered - and Sk@@ inner took a Olympic board in the qualifying rounds , but in the rank @-@ and @-@ second rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his turn , he fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hin@@ des went to a higher gear to slow him and make it known and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they climb@@ ed to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make a name for myself .
in the final round we placed an Olympic cord and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the site Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys there was hin@@ d@@ sight that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he will repeat Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the che@@ eses of Ho@@ y are the same .
Kenn@@ y is next in the Sprint , which will start today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year old Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal race of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.9@@ 42 at the destination .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition in which W@@ ig@@ gins with security will focus on safety .
he had fought yesterday with delegates before the qualification when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will continue tomorrow and ends tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong train steering team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a look at medals .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
Dra@@ mas played in the background , so the resig@@ nation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April is set in the middle of sex and mop@@ ed alle@@ g@@ ations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ TT , which has reached its climax at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the furn@@ ace of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand at the game as the plant operator termin@@ ate the energy supply contract , thereby increasing all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company shared .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant .
the sub@@ vention of a 20 @-@ year @-@ old subsi@@ dy will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs at the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria .
in 2014 Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting pot with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which Chinese companies C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process , &quot; the company shared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have been in force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts at its end of the year in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability to operate the enam@@ el or to ensure the supply of electricity to the enam@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have come into force from November this year , even if it is still a declaration of why it res@@ igned from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn of the potential closure of the Port Schmel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ala plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity per year and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts .
if both systems disappear from the market this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set it would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , Antonio is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue
Antonio J@@ enner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner , Clan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the U.S. Vo@@ gue .
Kendall , brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and went to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a space full of people I love brought me the sight of this cover to we@@ eping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Antonio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dis@@ closure of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an like ? ) , sc@@ anned reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn : they all have planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é beha@@ ved plot almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; , with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a broadcasting station at 8 am ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls take part in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September edition of Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly begun .
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim may have beaten her for the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of September issue of the magazine is a le@@ ague for himself .
the September edition is for Vo@@ gue the most most sold edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles an illustrated book rather than a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were adverti@@ sed by the 8@@ 32 pages of the company 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revel@@ ations of his cover stars are expected so eag@@ erly that in the last two years images of the magazine tran@@ spir@@ ed before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate M@@ oss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who mo@@ ose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Win@@ ner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Ms J@@ enner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or you@@ ths of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers like success not everyone .
with their reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always a bit ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d critic@@ ised and called her &quot; The Mist@@ akes of the Eye . &quot;
these feelings bo@@ iled up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but w@@ aking up on the mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by at the point .
Antonio J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertisement for your pri@@ ming of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her own pictures of Cin@@ dy CRA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . presum@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community centres annually assign 16@@ 0,000 people annually
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid conditions are aver@@ aged annually by the community centers , while the industry faces the impact of further mi@@ tigation on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ fair del@@ og@@ ations and similar - have been rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already exc@@ essi@@ vely busy , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell Community Centre said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centers revealed that thousands of people have already been dismis@@ sed every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only become even worse without repe@@ ating the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s Common Market Centr@@ es are chronic under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people from important services that you need will be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with irre@@ plac@@ eable and op@@ pres@@ sive debts , families that were dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations , workers who were dismis@@ sed un@@ just - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funding by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of need@@ y people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for the At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Adju@@ st@@ ment Ministers and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities and that Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government inv@@ ests in this important work .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occurred exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euros fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
but twenty years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Büro in West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received at these times : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was accessible .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , al@@ beit slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
very proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold and handled at Microsoft .
the market today domin@@ ates suppliers who came all much later than Nokia .
being online anytime and anywhere , this is everyday life for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple , were sold to 5@@ 55 million units of it alone .
worldwide sales with the equipment is about 400 billion euros .
in addition , the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and the telecommunications policy are coming .
in the meantime , a whole industry has ar@@ isen around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , easy to use by touch screen .
Apple began to win , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , which dominated the market , had the following .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said straight Jan@@ ina Sphere , responsible for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just like in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will create 10,000 new jobs for our local communities alone , create 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ aged on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , £ 211 bn of fun growth and a legacy of skills and employment to leave the airport as well as in the UK .
we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London &apos;s games from 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future commerce and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad block@@ age
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attempts to b@@ yp@@ ass ad block@@ age , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ads on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change enco@@ ding with regard to its adverti@@ sements , in order to make it difficult to detect which part of the page advertising is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ yp@@ ass the new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a blog post , the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ Battle between the attra@@ cting open source community and the en@@ closures has been underway since the invention of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicator block@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how alarm@@ ing ad lo@@ aders for the industry have become .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ geb@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people are using display block@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts 84 percent of advertis@@ ers .
the company has set it apart from desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on ebooks of mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agram , shared a speaker .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a big share of revenue so Facebook appears to be worthwhile investment of such a step .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would be updating its &quot; ad prevention tool &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook asser@@ ted that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the user , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced a Facebook spokes@@ person in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a mu@@ te means , which is why we have focused on developing tools like Ad Prefer@@ ences to put more control into the hands of the people .
wife of presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was transferred to a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss , at the age of 49 , who was transferred from several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said that these as well as any witness of the incident promp@@ ted us to report .
an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical step in such a situation , divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - where a person went on the motorway in the dark - was decided that drivers didn &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian run in the middle of the night on the motorway , as was the name in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer of the car@@ eless killing was acqu@@ itted after she had ski@@ pped and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become un@@ conscious of the street , took the court .
the Court found that the polic@@ e@@ woman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- came to an justified way and that the presence of a man on the streets was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ een situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 644 83 46 or 0@@ 21 644 44 44 .
NA@@ SA climate model : Venus was once inhabit@@ able
the Venus was probably inhabit@@ able according to the proj@@ ections of a new NA@@ SA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NA@@ SA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have rejected ground @-@ like conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation points to the fact that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still revol@@ ved slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to shelter life and protected from rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration .
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 per cent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus is exposed to the sun almost two months &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a story of Venus that resem@@ bles evolution , which was previously believed by planetary scientists .
although it was once inhabit@@ able , Venus was exposed to excess heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billions years .
their oceans are ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or has been burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen@@ us , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy performs as a trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a slight co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the club is immediately sought after a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have been thinking long and much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not currently being fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the best coach of the League during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the late season in each of the last two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell short of five points behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two plays with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ oil workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; res@@ ume talks , put strikes back &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour disputes with regard to the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea oil workers are subjected to , while all the issues for a new round of discussions put on the table , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Trade Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the process of winding up the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will ab@@ ide some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , which will begin early next year to re@@ connect the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has short@@ ened its rates on its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea this year by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s Rat@@ enk@@ ür@@ itz follows a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company are giving the required space to come through the market down@@ swing .
Shell has released for its part thousands of people and plans to aband@@ on its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alis@@ es its activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ re impact with the UK energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which had intensi@@ fied by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
at the beginning of this week , the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the Star Hall of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ er understand why stars in the star cluster rot@@ ate to different rates as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with planetary development .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the Earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
you are now shooting the quick@@ est .
at peak rates , these stra@@ pping stars come out large amounts of star win@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star emerg@@ es , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star@@ base -- like sun@@ spots -- recogni@@ zes .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than a few massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars turn more slowly pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
as the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it is still far ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation @-@ rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eb@@ all star comes from
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ guez than the US bas@@ eb@@ all star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional resig@@ nation , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will be wearing the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12th against T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to join , &quot; declared the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game Parti@@ cip@@ ant in the Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature among a ten @-@ year contract has granted him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle in@@ mates ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 he made some mil@@ estones .
only two more bas@@ eb@@ all players in the most important statistics show similar values with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star was given to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to have been banned from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , due to the involvement in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal , he was closed for 211 games by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main susp@@ ect who has received high @-@ performance funding for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the le@@ ague could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time addi@@ ctive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not running smoothly .
while many bas@@ eb@@ all legends got the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson are re@@ marked , sympathy @-@ friends of the fans of Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Erz@@ val@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; the supporters sang in the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez @-@ Team .
Olympia 2016 : chen Xin@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ckel@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing sample , weight lifting Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio is not allowed to start .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official dop@@ ing attacks .
an enligh@@ tened ath@@ l@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese float in Ch@@ en Xin@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ckel@@ wa from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and ruled out in Brazil - just before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions , these messages come to an end .
in Ch@@ en , last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de has been proven , which is used as a m@@ asked agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ fly , just around 0.0@@ 9 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the prec@@ urs@@ ors over 50 m Freestyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) has requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires a full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Xin@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court for CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first time in history is no longer the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio , the news about the positive sample of Dan@@ zig , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive itself .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was an unbelievable shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substance is to treat EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing .
Dan@@ ckel@@ wa was pro@@ visi@@ onally suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B test should also have been positive .
Bulg@@ ari@@ ens Prime Minister Boy@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported to criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes are not pulling the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all th@@ eg@@ ro@@ wers from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was also tested positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on three days earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both contest the intake , but they are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes is especially the case Dan@@ zig is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had banned the whole Russian team up to an exception for systematic dop@@ ing , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ no Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , in addition , the earlier off@@ ences in China were caused by violent conflicts between the athletes .
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Freestyle , I want to hand over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said on the French radio .
sun was also at the centre of a debate with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positively tested in the Chinese champion@@ ships on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din in 2014 , but only had to sit on a three @-@ month lock .

subsequently , the software presents the requirements of the black@@ mail .
to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where in private users the personal photo database stands on the game , companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in Germany several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of patient records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay , their data will get back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpet@@ rators in the face of down@@ time in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure explored the commercial areas and contact with black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the conclusion : the offen@@ ders actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free access sites , or deci@@ ph@@ er free example files .
and if private individuals are rede@@ emed by payments of a few hundred euros , companies must be partly hard to negotiate and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explains Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from anti @-@ virus @-@ provider SOPH@@ OS : &quot; a single person may write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programm@@ ers sell their malware in the form of a software building box to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits were created by the malware themselves , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is a adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail@@ ers then look for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instru@@ cts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is done per authentic@@ ated machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the crimin@@ als use sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the cryp@@ tion of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recognition , the offen@@ ders thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the potential for damage is still a much higher than ever depending on the type of data .
in future , the perpet@@ rators could also completely take on new targets on the internet of things .
at the Def@@ con chi@@ pper conference , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the offen@@ ders then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pé and even the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , really proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row as well as in the rear .
the materials of the interior are well @-@ finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit top is falling apart .
versatile than comparable vehicles , the HR @-@ V is in the storage box .
it is not only a trunk of 453 l with up@@ loaded and 10@@ 26 l with back@@ rest back@@ rests , but there is the Magic Se@@ ats .
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like kin@@ ell chairs and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1,6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the City emergency braking system belongs to the safety systems ( works up to Tempo 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the lane assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he over@@ laps many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant is very reliable .
and the intelligent controller respon@@ ds to traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed when needed .
the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch tou@@ ch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and HDMI jack are available under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the approximately 2@@ 9000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : over@@ throwing on passenger bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger lift .
because a liability is possible only if there are dangers that are typical for aviation , the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf argued ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee pit during the fall .
however , the accident could have been happening all over - it is a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
illness : when paid by the organis@@ er
after their journey , ill holiday@@ makers receive money only if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ ful in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests demonstrated the same symptoms .
in the case of the negoti@@ ated case , a family was severely ill from diar@@ rho@@ ea and v@@ om@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ il .
she spent almost all the holiday in the room .
their condition caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to return to a faul@@ ty se@@ wage plant which supp@@ os@@ edly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip was insufficient - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
before the court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
indeed , the wast@@ e@@ water treatment was indeed defective .
but the organizer shortly before the departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he did not hurt his duty of information , so the verdi@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially since in the samples of water there were no contam@@ in@@ ants found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ acting one another - belongs to the overall risk of life .
of 691 guests were only 38 people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , according to the acts of violence committed by refugees in Wu@@ er@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state must be pru@@ dent and decided at the same time to react to terrorism .
surely , our country will not answer the violence of perpet@@ rators with hatred and cle@@ av@@ age .
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if offen@@ ders have to leave the country faster , the security and strength also increase the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals until the 2017 elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personal strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in middle four @-@ digit order magnit@@ ude over several years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must again be under penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance needs to be improved , the weapon will be am@@ ended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is complicated .
the last much discussed silence for physicians should be maintained after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions how to reduce the threat of the citizens , he said at a glance about mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to counter@@ act the radi@@ c@@ alization of refugees , the minister holds a better social support necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
to prosec@@ ute crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans the use of conce@@ aled investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior clari@@ fied clearly against Action@@ ism .
&quot; this was an ear@@ thing for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the C@@ DU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ engruppe ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abo@@ lition of double citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a general ban on full @-@ veil is un@@ constitutional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can &apos;t do everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
one can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green CEO Simone Peter presented to the minister , he wanted to simul@@ ate with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror packages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; act of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and act of action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leaders Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet j@@ umps and tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better transport on the motorway brid@@ ging
it takes a regular look at the proc@@ ession road - here a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this should change : the right @-@ wing process should be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a good news for all car passengers traveling in traffic on the ambient road every night in the traffic jam when driving across the motorway exit Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the road building is extended by 700 meters in the area between Hammer Street and Wes@@ eler Straße in the area between Hammer Street and Wes@@ eler Straße .
motor@@ ists can then enter directly from the Hammer Street to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic con@@ veys an early stage , which will improve the overall sequence on the much @-@ frequ@@ ented section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the C@@ DU faction in the district court of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the listen@@ er anno@@ ys drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the return de@@ w extends up to the bridge across the Alber@@ sloh road and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here traffic is only one lane guided through the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back to a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load @-@ strength to record the heavy @-@ load traffic two @-@ lane .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related de@@ w will continue , the competent national business cannot say .
however , with years to reck@@ on , the bridge has an official rest @-@ time period up to 20@@ 34 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the right @-@ wing sector , Landes@@ betrieb deliberately chose the traffic weaker time in the school holidays because with disabilities is to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traffic will be tra@@ ced on Tuesday and Wednesday at the site .
intercultural travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy The@@ aters Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association , 19 students from 11 to 15 years visited the production in the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most young people in the class have come to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic pictures and video anim@@ ations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy The@@ aters Mu@@ en@@ ster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background should receive the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theat@@ rical play and theat@@ rical language evaluation are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
given the rising number of refugees , the association expects many classes that want to participate .
rain instead of Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany a line through the bill , but there is still hope .
the night was badly suitable for clouds and rain to watch the spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see a lot of star @-@ sn@@ aps in the sky .
the star @-@ sk@@ ates are Persi@@ ans , which are among the fastest star@@ ch@@ apes with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for in@@ som@@ nia
in the evening you turn around forever , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep in the morning before w@@ eck@@ er@@ kl@@ ing@@ eln .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ schung and Schlaf@@ medizin .
what one really understands below , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an on@@ e- and dor@@ man@@ t disorder .
especially the passage of sleep feels many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ oral factors , but also drugs .
in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is often common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that different factors would like each other .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and may well start to p@@ onder@@ ing over everyday problems and wor@@ ries , We@@ eß has an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you sleep with sleep disorders to the doctor ?
who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is imp@@ aired a day should go to the doctor , advis@@ es out .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look quite differently : you are beaten , tired , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ ache .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate sleep disorder , it is important to find their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classic sleep tablets occur only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
in Germany , low @-@ lo@@ wered sleep medicine is hardly available , emphas@@ ises Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleep problems , one should first turn to the practi@@ tioner , advis@@ es out .
it can be clari@@ fied with investigations if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory , medical professionals advise for example snor@@ ing with breathing apparatus , in case of disease wor@@ thin@@ ess , in case of in@@ som@@ nia or if one does not find the cause of in@@ som@@ nia , Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a mid@@ day sleep , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the disgu@@ sting , one goes to bed at his normal time .
besides the electro@@ des in the body , one carries a nas@@ al glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling depic@@ ts the sleeping @-@ end .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of screws on which one can put on a better sleep .
stuff counts : regular sleeping and rising times , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep too long , do not sleep watch TV to sleep , stop drinking , and don &apos;t look at the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to offer
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself via Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he first took gold at the short @-@ ground World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time exhibited his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler has been protecting his in the cri@@ tique of ex @-@ team members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 bonus and a jungle of 150 000 € shouldn &apos;t be surprised by missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveyor system in swimming sport is bad , however , the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look closely at the subject of dop@@ ing , or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; anyone who cannot control a certain time before WM / OS from independent inspec@@ tors of the W@@ ADA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; says the election ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice @-@ cream par@@ lor .
airport : gang of Bag@@ gage Lo@@ ans arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday the police officers of the police were able to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and bags as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30@@ h , civil servants recognized a gang in the area of Düsseldorf , which was known to the police from past theft .
since the middle of July this year , the two women and two men had committed several crimes and participated in a community , job @-@ friendly and very professional manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experts of the criminal comm@@ iss@@ aries 34 can prove four acts which were submitted specifically for the payment of off@@ ences to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , they exploited a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , meanwhile the rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stone streets : the R@@ ī@@ ga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like this , but the police are among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walking along the road from east to west , one passes the play@@ grounds , a freshly @-@ kn@@ itted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be dem@@ ol@@ ished , it will be built : a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article on this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will be illustrated in recent weeks , however , with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the occup@@ ants occupied rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin interior sen@@ ator H@@ enkel recorded several times for a hard action of the police against the project , called the &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; area for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on the 22nd June the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ avers , had been cleared with 300 police officers , the police arrested three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site , locked down sections of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearing had been illegal and one day later police and construction workers with@@ drew from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
this summer afternoon the street appears peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jana * , who draws three children here , are mainly generated by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the care of increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wants a majority of police guard against v@@ andal@@ ous lef@@ ti@@ sts .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police rise between house @-@ occup@@ iers and their neighbors , does not manifest so clearly .
in the east of Berlin , Friedrichsha@@ in was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which today , compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under large police cust@@ ody in a down@@ right road tunnel , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the city district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world : inhabitants from G@@ DR times and former home occup@@ ants share their neighborhood with them .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 with new rental companies .
many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them with s@@ lic@@ ed discs or freshly painted faç@@ ades that have been tos@@ sed with colour bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous power &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : off@@ ences such as body inj@@ ections are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ ences make property damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94 , uncertainty cannot be mentioned .
as for acts of violence , it is important : people in 94 are their neighbours who are not destined to be .
also the famous burning cars no longer exist in Riga .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved to Riga - and stayed .
for this reason , it was also so important that the residents get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , all of which suddenly claimed the Deut@@ scher@@ hu@@ stle of the district in July .
however , in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away from them : due to ges@@ tic@@ ul@@ ous new buildings in former mos@@ quit@@ oes that displ@@ ace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are housing apartments , which are not interesting for many - here people live , who are not so well drunk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction cannot be regarded as absolute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if somebody never stops listening ?

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee representative
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee representative for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the team of the administration of Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group asylum assistance , administration , authorities and who else still mis@@ ses .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , the uns@@ ett@@ ling Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au , which has a problem above all .
in this way , some - less mo@@ cking than on the large number of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
we were looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long experience in the field of social work , just an urgent wo@@ ollen mil@@ der .
but administrative work is not her central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
in particular , it involves organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are great and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
new containers in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find homes for connecting refugees that have been acknowledged .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ rat@@ samt on the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
in fact , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far it didn &apos;t work , so it was necessary to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , rural apartments must be guar@@ ded as it is so beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so soon new containers are placed in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and services for refugees and migrants who need to be inv@@ aded or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help master masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day need a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people must develop a sense of belonging .
so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here manage administration and volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
they need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
those who develop the feeling eventually , he could not help anyone in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , he will never integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there is also problem cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says customer frank@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : did the two after the recent inci@@ dents fear radi@@ c@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some may call na@@ ï@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ inations could bring them up completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
thus , the main and volunteers will have to look out for activities in the region and in the region .
they always have in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics is sho@@ eing .
actually , it is un@@ fair to place them on site .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the existing people sensi@@ bly .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .

the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1,70 metres tall , probably m@@ asked , both Blue@@ jeans and black Kapu@@ zen@@ pul@@ lis contributed .
they fled towards the city center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the prosecution , the police set up several pun@@ ches and a helicop@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the flag was without success .
perhaps the unknown ones did not fall close to the apartment or their escape .
