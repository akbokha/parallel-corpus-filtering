<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively withdraw regulations, and he is fighting for a far-reaching fiscal reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>

<seg id="14">The democratic applicant even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announced an official end of the eight-month war of the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated ballroom of the St. Petersburg palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed narrower and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if something bad would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I seemed to be rather the opposite of his enthusiasm." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin informed and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the eyebrow becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media held a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed as if the Turks had to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was held only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he has been almost enthroned with a failed coup d'etat last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is reduced by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-ended rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious on the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the continued groll on the snail empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian state of state gained a bonus that after the attempted coup d "état he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray an "alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once said: two countries that violate themselves from the West and feel bad and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, in spite of the public reconciliation, there are always great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents spoke at the press conference that they hadn't even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey was deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect dismissal when NATO member Turkey kicked off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia Putin humblers Stabschef Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was part of Putin's tight vote for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement by the Kremlin it reads that Putin has ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is (in Russian) that he later became the chief executive and Chief of Staff of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it's the main task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow secretive.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidant and works as he was for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, aired on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff was withdrawing at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "but despite the smile for the cameras, only a few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a sort of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president, would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - appealable posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people he most trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally, Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1,35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North deck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closing of the" "" "ceiling blowers" "", "which approach the completion by each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 incline ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1,35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economic Minister Keith Brown refuses to visit the site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, nearly 79% of the total bridge are located at their place and the last section of the Decks is getting a concrete casting for the deck today, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of trendsetting high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the Nordturmdeck, we had to close the gap in the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate, because the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - they were only a few millimeters on each side.</seg>

<seg id="5">But quarrel is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, it is about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>

<seg id="16">Regardless of that, so Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and child no longer go outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens has been lamented by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go it's about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that was based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest before the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that the server overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go out with their smartphones to the outside and look for Pokemon that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (over a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the chair and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person returns each day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracked 35.000 users, the Washington Post recently reported that within two days of the game launch, the number of traceable people who exercise every day 30 minutes, increased from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active every day" "", "because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Whoever drives sport regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual there are also mürk toys that have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should I do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will take time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with active players in the real world and help many people on hunting, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="8">On the whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast appeared on Thursday for a multibattle title and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team-mates Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American female Simone Biles turnt on the floating beam during the individual campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bilit is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-fight title and overall the fifth while she consolidates her reputation, the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts it in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Bilit has dominated the last three years of her sport, 15 world championships - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton told her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It awaited her a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Bille and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American female Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after they won gold and silver during the individual campaigns of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday,</seg>

<seg id="21">Although it insisted on the head to never have planned the future during its long journey, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which includes their typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a school trip to the gymnasium, trained in the Boorman, became the force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost a competition competition, a winning series that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina led through two turns, the picture smelled.</seg>
<seg id="27">Schwebebalken and Bodenturnen - in which Bilten holds the world championship title - lautered.</seg>
<seg id="28">She repeated again with 15.433 on the floating beam - and sat on the ground with a 15.933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman gently embraced her as she expected her grief - pure formality - and tears poured on red bright red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book of book, became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old male capitalist, which is called "Grandma," by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her floor exercise she threw the public treasury, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Bilit, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I present in the gymnastics union in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin and Madison Kocian, which is Katholikin, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among the female gymnasts has been an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America rejoiced.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world championships Simone Bilar, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, yet masterful Gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold in an individual multi-campaign event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the peak of this kind of sport, but that's not what sports classes do not look like in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that Turnen is an expensive sports and gymnasts primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued in any way.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the Turner get their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both exercised their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to be inspired by the municipalities of innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-access exercise training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international champions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sports.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnes develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to get interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine depiction of "Girl Power" by holding the olympic team golds and thanks, you were motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 resident doctors who voted for election rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt plans had unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the treaty and said that the NHS would be found in a "Niemandsland" and would be damaging any further delay for the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistance doctors are supposed to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of unrelated watch periods.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairwoman of the BMA Committee on Assistant Doors shared last night in a communication with: "assistant physicians pointed out serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will heat the current staff crisis and it will be to treat all doctors" justice. "</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes by talking to the government should be involved and sometimes deafening silence.</seg>

<seg id="12">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association.</seg>

<seg id="16">In the last two months we talked to the Assistant Secretary and responded positively to the concerns about the tutelage and the Whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that continuing positive engagement to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, training programs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding the compliance with the BMA in November, February and May were.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anticoagulant medication Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="6">The NICE of the NHS Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year-long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffers another heart attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls, which form floorings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the covering breaks apart, it can cause a blood clots that blocked the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">If the blood clots solves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clogged the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the trade name Brière, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more improbable.</seg>
<seg id="13">The NICE draft bill, published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE health technology evaluation centre said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack, a further heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">Fear of renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces further heart attacks and strokes for people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">By a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to rotate the skewer for your predator.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you approach you from behind, then you should turn around as a first, so that you can see your attacker and go out of the line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon then between your forearm and your shoulder before you face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat him with the knee in the bar and rotate while the aggressor clumps against pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards as she directed the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the weapon and rotate them, so that the attacker can not shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attacker to the chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and throws of a serious test - by selecting some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk donated his course to a euro bill, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a jetty of a pull toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before emptying any object he used a Luminometer to show off and to show us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," resulted in some surprising results.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to lick the rinsing button of a pull toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his intestine by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railways to railway stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task set its immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "he told:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was definitely righteous to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its sample line showed a luminescence number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminescence number of fresh washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick after their luminescence was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "It comes close to the worst thing I've germinated in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirtier than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let us call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking only about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who was directing the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others, in which it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by the year 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria associated with the well being of gastrointestinal bacteria and 58 percent said that they may at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after a delogation of £50,000, because they terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had afflicted holes, wooden planks were roughened, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was decorated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family resettled and it is assumed that it now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the management at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider, as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons, who meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted, street fights with baseball sleepers, intimidations of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strikes and floods included.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skellefone, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which will be demolished under circumstances, old trash was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wood-planks were torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the streets and regularly called the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing launched her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them a extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily surrender.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it was administered by the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house, to which the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the municipal house, garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family, as a delogation is always the final step of considering the Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extremely and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the Police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "I hope that this development will donate consolation to some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated." ""</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found about 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skelbet earned a fine of money after having found himself guilty of owning a class B drug in commercial law.</seg>

<seg id="37">After having been without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were decorated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says that they will delogate tenants who do not cling to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the Devon and Cornwall police informed that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not obey the house rules.</seg>

<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>

<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass over the people over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>

<seg id="13">It will be exciting, how strong Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition breakthroughs.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before commenting on the comment section, consult him under the pseudonym NonAllevien' men of Mittlerage with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed re-emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers rather retain their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while in the middle of a busy street in Soho run a modest gray suit and let me go wild before I stop, keep my hands and make a certain determinant like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill in the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialist shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observing them.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him at home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford to buy when she appeared and once again bought items he sold when he was young and striking.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought probably was too young to buy it to me," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and love to spend time alone, and adds:" "" "I don't smoke and I don't drink much." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray also believes that many customers he meets may apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub, people who have heard about the comeback and can see to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people usually have emptied their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of adherents to the record grounds of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record stores have a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ some of the older customers assumed an impetus to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some plate fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to retreat to the stability of familiar noise clamps, from items that awaken happy youth notes.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a staff derives from a pile stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet stopped.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, do not own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I puzzled through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone recently came here and said," "" "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radio ringed record, so that I can put them on the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productable, less musically-rich.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly enter.</seg>
<seg id="44">Opp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a bant audience when I enter.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sexpack pop instead of experimental jazz pampers from the speakers - it's good to see such a diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely but nagging mental traumas are hard to detach when standing next to somebody for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for several minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a shop window as a large purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, therefore collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or another way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives away with a dearded sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I seem to print the jeans-hotline, I watch a group of young age girls who are grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley Record Player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential boards for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these objects could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my inquiries showed that the results of YouGov vote, they, at least in record stores in Soho, let them take into account the large number of female collectors in the reality, plate shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the bumblebees through record stores of Berwick Street and the sheets by plates while they steer clear of an uncanny, 30-year-old fake moderator, who raises nothing of middle-aged men over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial this week the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be fuelled 72 provisional shops to sell, sell, offer barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few Euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would constitute a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and that could be a fire and health risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "were absolutely traceable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than simply feed people living" "" "in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meetings between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by rainfall was the jungle Book Kids "Café des Lagers, which is operated in a non-profit way and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as a consultation on the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>

<seg id="13">The two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants cherished on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-year rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji emptied a master class in the handling, side steppe, back, line run and rough strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was won by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The strong defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of that, Fiji had beaten a 15-man-team in the form of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for GB - but will probably not - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang his neck: Fijis head trainer Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every play at the Adelaide seSevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lose one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This flap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started marveling and suffered from the attacks GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if they were running in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to top, when Osea Koldovau passed over in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing time Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he changed.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hassle Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to score a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute jasa Veremalua lete a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the re-launch and there was still more than a minute game time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured by further weak tacklings of the UK team and stormed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion took a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still studying.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is also.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB conducted fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the nasty gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova to a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South Seunters, whose fans sang, flags, and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fijis caught, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked out crushed in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-finalmatch from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks back in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside Teams, secured the winning - and therefore the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="15">I needed money, so I needed to go back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and running around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.</seg>

<seg id="19">The rowing of itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, Spirit, Health: singing is good seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp accompanied her entire life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in Lehramt he occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good with her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, Erhard Hackler says of the German Seniorenliga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior singers sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular collaborations, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, Hackler means.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who demand his lungs on a regular basis, even in everyday life are not as fast as the bust.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it's about getting the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisationen.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or listening to songs in elderly people awaken many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, dementia suffers from long back events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head will also require special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone are not just focusing on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, Hackler means.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I am long for something, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent, advises Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Whoever wants to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can turn directly to the congregation or the Church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many Seniorenchants can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who have no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors to help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="7">In the approximately 200 kilometer south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin was first exploded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two bombs.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thailänderin was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Friday morning, two explosives went up again and another person was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket, a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the detonation near the popular beach resort Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a municipal employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities in a flower bed, the explosive was put into the air in front of the territory of the Coastal Police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally detonations in Phang Nga and Trang demanded several injured on the south-western coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bombings carry the same handwriting," "" "said army general Danai Kritmethavee free day ahead of journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we assume that this is a co-ordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it is too early to manifest itself to possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks, which is typical for the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks would not occur in connection with the Islamist revolt movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is just local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">One rather assumes that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "the authorities would have kept secret information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however, they were not informed of the exact time and places." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials across the country to reinforce security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are repeatedely smaller bomb attacks, but they usually do not focus on tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin there is a palace used by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "following the strong bombing explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities in a row." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (safety level 3) ended up for the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its environs.</seg>
<seg id="30">After confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no need to travel to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (safety level 2) paid for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military huge influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to stiff chaos while the country faces stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, maintains itself to have led the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not managed to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, in Bangkok, a stop at a popular Hindu shrine was killed 20 people - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>

<seg id="1">The price per cubic meter sewage is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the new sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl 3,44 instead of previously 2,10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (previously 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (previously 2.18 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a pertinent calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, with the approval of the household by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, it was noted that for these wastewater installations subliabilities were opened.</seg>
<seg id="5">Based on legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obligated to operate the facilities in a cost-coverable manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg must go deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Head of Administration Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or submissions from the previous calculation period may also be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt thus founded the engraved fee increases in all three sewage plants with relatively small facilities with a very low waste water treatment, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution basis for example expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the sewage volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to the age of refurbishment and repair expenses, the recovery period fell in a considerable amount due to its age of refurbishment and repair costs.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for puppy meals, Neudorf and Reuth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt proved that in the wastewater plant Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping plant Welschenkahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveying systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be extended, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to be able to keep the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Schmidt:" "" "for these extraordinary expenses, the continued maintenance costs and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that during the low waste water waste in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were "fully smashed."</seg>
<seg id="20">Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs in the wastewater systems has been spared during the last 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the aforementioned plants will continue to remain precarious in the long run, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater association could not be extended by these facilities because they are deficient institutions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" -effect as an Asian caricature has been criticised</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is Anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be a painting of a Roy Lichtenstein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are immaculate, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All faults get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past where they were accused of promoting the Blackface promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested some users a filter that gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and evaporated cheeks, some critics call a racist caricature of Asians - "Yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversy pointed to a greater problem that the company has a diversity of diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it had deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was meant as a homage to anime characters and not as cartoon by Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filtering of vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American student, whose tweet was widely distributed across the photos was that the filter was "hurting, and the least said unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very resistant Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-face has been drawn into the descent extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stolperdrade.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's big audience of young people - who are different in terms of race as their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchat filtering creates a picture that is insulting for a user, "it is much harder for such things to remain unnoticed than it was previously the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and asking others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for media and in a telephone interview, she said that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices in Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu also criticized the large part white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>

<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence services to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as the actual states were allowed on the ground, reported a committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The provisional report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the army committees, secret services committees and the military budget, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superiors changed their appreciation to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, shortly CenCom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "intelligence reports that were typically ingenious by high-ranking Centcom commanders reported regularly a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism when they had allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services," "" "a newspaper article cited the report."

<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened to Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives, stated." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct references to that government spikes under Obama have given instructions to change the reports it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015 many Central Command Press Releases, comments and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than it meets the facts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom was publicly known that a military reconnaissance of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second-largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigations, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's leaders changed intelligence reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after them being admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of Centcom's reports are held by the Secretary-General of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in the years 2014 and 2015 Centcom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence reports on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "announced the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, Member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>

<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats indicated no evidence of intervening in the White House at Centcom analysts in regard to a" "" "specific political opinion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of the congress were published Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector who was taken up by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, gave in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on Congress reports, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions of the question of a successful airfield under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disagreements of more than ten years ago, as a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, a piece of writing about how the former government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker to specify government agencies that contrary to the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State did not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger Commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the Legislative for its excessively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retiring in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">A day after she had shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American squad team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games were supposed to represent a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember this ever done.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, there are the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel continuous and inevitable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is passed from the bracelets to the swimmers to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the conflict between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time in the Olympics and being a womb with dimples, could have been among these known names that would have been sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he was a swimmers, turner or even fencing.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic Trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade, the sports that are not generally accepted: air duster shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was perceived so sparingly for the last 16 years that many who had asked me didn't know that it was a Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has some outsiders, partly because it sounds more fitting for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of the Turnens and Diving, the two sports that essentially unites it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to turn a number of falling movements (turning, real and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are rated according to the official Olympic programme according to design, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes to the finish, sometimes to the top and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the baseline, but also in the TV transmission another courtly destination: the world or the Olympic-ords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir up a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel at looking at these games as a bit tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an atempause.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly upward.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no tactical attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Women's Qualification and Endrills will take place on Friday afternoon, in the stream at 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon bloc on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the attacking and objective of male athlete - as the male American Turner recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his air rinse, new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia came to violence against the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that umpy protesters were killed during clashes with the police in shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the government shaken the country and expanded in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the response of the government was indestructible.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses pointed out that police officers fired and killed on umpy unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security guards hit young people with shocks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now calling for a detailed investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the head of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism beyond the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced, with dissidents being effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central America.</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use to strangers in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a wide-ranging election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been forced more or less in recent years, use turbulence and arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of anklankle under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">In recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they were so protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Orom and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who are mainly Christian high-lands from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy as they exploited the Orom of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are to co-ordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Orosei have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which constitute approximately 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "the third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was an Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly savvy in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special commissioned officers to manipulate enemies and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he is not enjoying the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uproar in 2005, after thousands against elections protested, which, according to statements by analysts, were apparently deceived by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed even if there were less than in the last months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure plan, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters attacked in Gondar, an amperical city, led by Tigray and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming increasingly common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for country flights over the neighboring Somalia, although she recently reported that she closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to clearly support democracy, he doesn't want his allies to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump has attempted to scatter the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by fearing that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification gave rise to new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidates, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings out his comrades who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase in order to explain to the peculiar position, declarations that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening Mr. Trump broke back with regard to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the opposite to the previous day where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the allegation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama would destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate wanted nothing to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism prasselt down to Mr. Trump while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling cargo.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech bored.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he strongly criticised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clintons's Emails, but later he explained, "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the language barriers in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "according to what the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more etched tone, as his demand values continued to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general tries to excuse himself for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal co-supporters to the uncomfortable situation to have to stand to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent intercessors, was struggling to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "" "Mr. Giuliani said therefore to the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements questioned whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them ambassadors, completely wrong, and therefore it happened, because he removed the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, served by Mrs. Clinton as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trumps excuse as only one further evidence that he was inappropriate for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once sold over the price of the market, Café comes back to Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a bubbly café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash that didn't have Wi-Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices dropped out of his Bedford Avenue store front.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Soap Cherie shop, which was sold in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indigenous people saw it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel exempt and Verb is now a soap store."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is a change, it is also a re-invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old coffee shop, the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working with Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to provide money for a new outside table, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, retained a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso headers model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garniters like capers and fried onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no beer more, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also driven by prices from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a client.</seg>

<seg id="4">Its menu on this day was slightly more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," Jane Ziegelman said.</seg>

<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>

<seg id="23">The new budgetary was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became staple foods that assert casserole as a "wonderful way to recycle food residues," Ziegelman noted, as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely serrated luxury.</seg>

<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost goldplated dining room and had a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was very foreign to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt would have reportedly committed the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to stature his stomach.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks will only receive up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland sharks along the North Atlantic coast, in an hour it is average straight 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it depends on it, the five-meter-long animal speeds up 2.6 km / h and is half as fast as a seal at this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle, characterized by slowness, seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal" "" "Science" "" "at any rate from a Greenland-hai that could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness" "", "commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist has long assumed that Greenland hay will become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear in the winter at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow pace was so as they pretended to take six animals with a transmitter before Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks nevertheless make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they chase sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadavers that torment from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland sharks who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetre measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its birth should therefore lie after the early 1960 "s, when atomic weapons hunt larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with 220 centimetres of length, the lenker contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, and it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their linden core, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">Indeed, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 cm long Grönland shark showed an age of 335 years, whereas the record-shark with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland sharks with the multiplication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates currently.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters, is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland wal, whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon lace, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on fire flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and altern more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should, on the other hand, invest his resources into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the road on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together four stages were met.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next round trip of all the ministries in two years, the ministerial meeting St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were checked and one decided finally for the bishop city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the open doors of mercy on Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruole, Haigerloch, and Heiligenzimmern arose.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crucifixion and divided the pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb there was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where there was also a Münster Beloved woman and thus the pilgrim path was taken from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were accompanied by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts in the morning and evening.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the road, the Minis made up to field crosses, chapels and churches again and again to sing a song from a specially formed pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">The local parishes were at their disposal for the nights.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ensured a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">It continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day, one joined the leg to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of route, had to climb around 500 altimeters first and then be climbed afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="15">The earned reward was a common barbecue in the evening at the Badweiher.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning pulse on the fourth Pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearly facilitated and happy, the Minis arrived at Freiburger Muenster in the late afternoon and went through the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the evening mass in Münster, the Minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination by Kooperator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raste last night in the men's team sprint in Velodrome in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchorage, who had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy himself to Eigen. he made the legend proud when he stormed at home to hit a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in London's world championships in London, despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Anfahrers Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement has produced a gap, the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots, which now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy conquered - and Skinner took a Olympic board in the qualifying rounds, but in the rank-and-second rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his turn, he fell short, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hindes went to a higher gear to slow him and make it known and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they climbed to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round we placed an Olympic cord and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the site Kennys and Hoys there was hindsight that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said," "" "It feels like the whole GB flags on the grandstand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he will repeat Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was born just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The cheeses of Hoy are the same.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next in the Sprint, which will start today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year old Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal race of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942 at the destination.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held on the second day of the competition in which Wiggins with security will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought yesterday with delegates before the qualification when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue tomorrow and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong train steering team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a look at medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April is set in the middle of sex and moped allegations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom it looks like the legendary reputation GTT, which has reached its climax at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand at the game as the plant operator terminate the energy supply contract, thereby increasing all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company shared.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies for the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">The subvention of a 20-year-old subsidy will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs at the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects, as the melting process consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closing of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation with regard to the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting pot with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which Chinese companies CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process," the company shared.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to say that the contracts are called" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which should have been in force from November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts at its end of the year in the amount of $187 million in" "" "anticipation of cancellation." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="20">The US company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would have come into force from November this year, even if it is still a declaration of why it resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Due to the poor economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn of the potential closure of the Port Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomala plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will consume around 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago around 900 megawatts.</seg>

<seg id="2">Antonio Jenner, 20, Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner, Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the U.S. Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a space full of people I love brought me the sight of this cover to weeping," "" "wrote Antonio." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the cliché behaved plot almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?", with the honesty of a cartoon on a broadcasting station at 8 am), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendal's big sister Kim may have beaten her for the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of September issue of the magazine is a league for himself.</seg>

<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles an illustrated book rather than a fashion magazine, the output draws a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were advertised by the 832 pages of the company 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelations of his cover stars are expected so eagerly that in the last two years images of the magazine transpired before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>

<seg id="14">Oscar-Winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners like success not everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV story, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret-Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised and called her "The Mistakes of the Eye."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But waking up on the missmut seems to pass by at the point.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have rejected ground-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation points to the fact that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still revolved slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to shelter life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus is exposed to the sun almost two months" "", "stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a story of Venus that resembles evolution, which was previously believed by planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was once inhabitable, Venus was exposed to excess heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans are evaporated and their water vapor has been burned away from ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Star Hall of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomer understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates as well as in which context the rotational periods are associated with planetary development.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cluster of the Pleiades lies 445 lightyears distant from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">You are now shooting the quickest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rates, these strapping stars come out large amounts of star winches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star emerges, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable starbase -- like sunspots -- recognizes.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than a few massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turn more slowly pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: due to a positive doping sample, weight lifting Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio is not allowed to start.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overshadowed by the first official doping attacks.</seg>
<seg id="4">An enlightened athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese float in Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle course in Silwia Danckelwa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifters Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and ruled out in Brazil - just before the start of the already critical athletics competitions, these messages come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been proven, which is used as a masked agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly, just around 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the precursors over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has requested the opening of the B-trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very serious and requires a full cooperation in the investigations," "" "stated Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court for CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The first time in history is no longer the IOC, but the CAS for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also during the night of Rio, the news about the positive sample of Danzig, the 33-year-old went into the offensive itself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was an unbelievable shock, "she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she was innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "explained the athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance is to treat EPO blood doping.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danckelwa was provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B test should also have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgariens Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately reported to criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes are not pulling the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all thegrowers from the chronically doping nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "on Friday the event" "" "Adrian Zielinski" "", "the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was also tested positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Both contest the intake, but they are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes is especially the case Danzig is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The world association IAAF had banned the whole Russian team up to an exception for systematic doping, also the Läuferno Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming sport, in addition, the earlier offences in China were caused by violent conflicts between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang hard.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "sun Yang pinkelt purple" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"when I see the podium more than 200 m Freestyle, I want to hand over," Lacourt said on the French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also at the centre of a debate with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," "" "said this." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was positively tested in the Chinese championships on the stimulant Trimetazidin in 2014, but only had to sit on a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="6">The offenders specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to generate ransom is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "World." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then discovered the perpetrators of blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">At first, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was startling rapidly over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of an victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the requirements of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end-key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where in private users the personal photo database stands on the game, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of patient records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay, their data will get back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of downtime in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure explored the commercial areas and contact with blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the offenders actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set free access sites, or decipher free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed by payments of a few hundred euros, companies must be partly hard to negotiate and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explains Chester Wisniewski from anti-virus-provider SOPHOS: "a single person may write a ransomware circa within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software building box to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by the malware themselves, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included is a adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then look for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set from a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is done per authenticated machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals use spammers with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>

<seg id="38">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the cryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recognition, the offenders threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculation," "" "explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the potential for damage is still a much higher than ever depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could also completely take on new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Defcon chipper conference, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the offenders then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, really proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although only 1,60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row as well as in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well-finished and work pleasant, only the cockpit top is falling apart.</seg>
<seg id="7">Versatile than comparable vehicles, the HR-V is in the storage box.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a trunk of 453 l with uploaded and 1026 l with backrest backrests, but there is the Magic Seats.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like kinell chairs and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1,6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm.</seg>
<seg id="12">Originaltitel: CSI: crime Scene Investigation (TV)</seg>

<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>

<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant is very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent controller responds to traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and HDMI jack are available under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will get the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, diesel from 23000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for insomnia</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you turn around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep in the morning before weckerklingeln.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Schlafforschung and Schlafmedizin.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one really understands below, however, is the Insomnia, i.e. an one- and dormant disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially the passage of sleep feels many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychic or behavioral factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is often common in depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors would like each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and may well start to pondering over everyday problems and worries, Weeß has an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with sleep disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired a day should go to the doctor, advises out.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite differently: you are beaten, tired, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classic sleep tablets occur only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, low-lowered sleep medicine is hardly available, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleep problems, one should first turn to the practitioner, advises out.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with investigations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory, medical professionals advise for example snoring with breathing apparatus, in case of disease worthiness, in case of insomnia or if one does not find the cause of insomnia, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a midday sleep," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the disgusting, one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes in the body, one carries a nasal glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling depicts the sleeping-end.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws on which one can put on a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Stuff counts: regular sleeping and rising times, not too long in bed, don't sleep too long, do not sleep watch TV to sleep, stop drinking, and don't look at the watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some linden trees, meanwhile the rest of the cobblestone streets: the Rīga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this, but the police are among the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walking along the road from east to west, one passes the playgrounds, a freshly-knitted kindergarten and a bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" ugly! "" "" sprayed on the facade of a grey house. "" "</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, it will be built: a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article on this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be illustrated in recent weeks, however, with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the occupants occupied rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator Henkel recorded several times for a hard action of the police against the project, called the "No-Go Zone" area for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the 22nd June the rooms on the ground floor, the cadavers, had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police arrested three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, locked down sections of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearing had been illegal and one day later police and construction workers withdrew from sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">This summer afternoon the street appears peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who draws three children here, are mainly generated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the care of increasing rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who wants a majority of police guard against vandalous leftists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police rise between house-occupiers and their neighbors, does not manifest so clearly.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the east of Berlin, Friedrichshain was actually a traditional working-class district, which today, compared to the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street very close to Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared under large police custody in a downright road tunnel, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the city district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world: inhabitants from GDR times and former home occupants share their neighborhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 with new rental companies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them with sliced discs or freshly painted façades that have been tossed with colour bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often together with the words" "" "left-autonomous power" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: offences such as body injections are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences make property damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94, uncertainty cannot be mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for acts of violence, it is important: people in 94 are their neighbours who are not destined to be.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars no longer exist in Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved to Riga - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">For this reason, it was also so important that the residents get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the Deutscherhustle of the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: due to gesticulous new buildings in former mosquitoes that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are housing apartments, which are not interesting for many - here people live, who are not so well drunk," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction cannot be regarded as absolute." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if somebody never stops listening?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry about color bombs, the Hauts and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws, should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub district where it can complain bad about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons only presented with first names have asked not to be named with their real name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee representative</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee representative for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogy supports the team of the administration of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group asylum assistance, administration, authorities and who else still misses.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is there, the unsettling Wollmilchsau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less mocking than on the large number of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, connected with a long experience in the field of social work, just an urgent woollen milder.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">In particular, it involves organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine client that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are great and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find homes for connecting refugees that have been acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landratsamt on the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it didn't work, so it was necessary to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "therefore, rural apartments must be guarded as it is so beautiful." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence there are internships, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and services for refugees and migrants who need to be invaded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help master masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People must develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here manage administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who develop the feeling eventually, he could not help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there is also problem cases," "" "says customer frankly," "" "people with whom nothing goes." "" "the work of Deuschle and the customer is always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two after the recent incidents fear radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "what some may call naïve" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassinations could bring them up completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Thus, the main and volunteers will have to look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics is shoeing.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the urbacher is already busy to integrate the existing people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
