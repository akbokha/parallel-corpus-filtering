Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as T@@ ehr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the encounter it should also go to the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the deal of the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the U.S. Congress , which was clo@@ cked in part as an aff@@ ront against Obama .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election of the election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an emergency call , Professor , shot his girl@@ friend shot
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb talked with a slightly z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still alive and probably was excited , and he said that the family @-@ acts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was bent on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could reverse it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who served in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , has already travelled 300 miles to the school site , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ tic@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal emergency call some@@ time afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cled it .
one day after shooting at the University , the students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw an image of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have any history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to be proble@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers who praised Lamb , said he seemed too excited and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the University meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as a Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parent house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met together with friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play .
he was the wom@@ b of the wom@@ b at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said she was divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb hit Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared three years ago on a summer fair .
later they played one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertaining co @-@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5th September for the last time , after Lamb finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no evidence that something did not vote .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the Dead Professor , led the first semester seminar programme and specialised in American nati@@ ves and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lectur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle light ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wa@@ che , while the universal &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be taken back on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is ahead .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Emil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox sh@@ ears about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I feel that the seat is empty beside me and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simul@@ ated G@@ äh@@ nen and an ar@@ mes@@ al length of it to be with the princ@@ ess of Wales with a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had pre@@ mier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disp@@ uted the greatest time travel film that has ever been shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN boss says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ Moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integ@@ rative negotiations on finding a political solution .
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria that they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand it as flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks of surveys , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump probably won the Repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
experts stress that Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain in 2011 , and none of them won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups such as Je@@ b B@@ ush@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ umps stamina and begin to release their dollar to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
clou@@ d@@ iness values have turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump arrived in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa has found last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Repub@@ lican voters say that they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 per cent think that he did not have the personality to effectively run his office , and almost six of 10 people say that his tem@@ per does not p@@ asse into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Repub@@ lican voters get used to the idea .
when they put their money @-@ hat@@ s , repub@@ lican voters uph@@ old Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the end of July , when four from ten end of July have put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle four of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters will look at Tr@@ umps &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump proposes almost everyone .
some experts point out that the spl@@ itter@@ ing field probably contributes to Tr@@ umps leadership while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed over more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump has harv@@ ested majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a little majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have given their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 per cent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , sad@@ ness is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago immig@@ rant from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in the public discourse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Repub@@ lican party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as the immigration in the spot@@ light remains , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ ed to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , around half of the support of Repub@@ lican voters , mainly due to their out@@ sider status .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ ags survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .

Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ fold Tor@@ schüt@@ ze in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have described the FC Bayern in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hex@@ enk@@ essel from Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won the Champions League in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 89 . ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starter success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
Müller was awarded in the Champions League in the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ Leader@@ ship for Bavaria @-@ Leader@@ ship by Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who made a shot of the world champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ Kap@@ itän promised Philipp Lah@@ m ahead of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich kept word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus won his most recent six home games in the Royal Class , including known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up Du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went brave to work with their offensive efforts but often too resour@@ c@@ eful .
the attacks were often initiated by game storage on the left side Douglas Costa , which rarely happened against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k struck from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ ch .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half of one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct removal , the Tor@@ wart Roberto with the knee par@@ ked ( 35 . ) .
although the Bavaria moved to their usual dominant game , Pir@@ äus was able to set up needle sti@@ che .
on Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was aband@@ on@@ ment .
so , when he shot a shot of Ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te ( 56@@ th ) .
before Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ res , was first sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who wants to make something different from it is mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first time , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the annex@@ ed Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made 13 minutes later all clear , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still sat on it .
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ ashed Bavaria fans in their audience block apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with stro@@ kes against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bavaria fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , not only does the lung , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam @-@ long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of reno@@ un@@ cement the risk decreases quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this is based on the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smoking was the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold higher .
the scientists had watched more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes for tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ um , stres@@ ses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ o@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss therefore goes back to more frequent g@@ ums in smo@@ kers .
it is not clari@@ fied that smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , first aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people must convince people who are non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking reduces life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessels and leads to our knowledge also to a good dental health up to the high age .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population is affected at the age of 65 to 74 years of pl@@ ess@@ ness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early teeth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lining the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet at the Rhine river bank on the remains of the late Anti@@ quity .
for the repeated time , on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne archaeological finds have been made .
near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remn@@ ants of historical buildings , said director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
at all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a specialist office for arch@@ e@@ ological soil conservation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now been found five .
from text documents it was already known that at the place in the 4th century , a fortress and in the 8th century have stood up a church , explained Trier .
in addition to the remn@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 gra@@ ves , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman captured by freight train
after a young woman died at the train station in established G@@ eil@@ enkir@@ chen Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the population for assistance .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the determination of the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement T@@ TIP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private lighting equipment for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S @-@ Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ din has introduced the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proce@@ eding con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the USA jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come to the same parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise obj@@ ections against jud@@ g@@ ments .
so far , the proced@@ ural participants agreed to themselves on arbit@@ rators , an obj@@ ection to their jud@@ g@@ ments .
in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented .
in the long term , she wants to work according to his own data on an international investment court .
for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied there .
the investor state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justi@@ fication , beyond the company &apos;s claims for damages to the tax@@ pay@@ ers , to negotiate national laws or impose a lowering of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organisations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) described the plans as a great progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission has taken into account the reform of significant points that the Federal Minister of Economic Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel has worked in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration was from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European company association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned about limiting the use of the economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
when the talks on the T@@ TIP Free Trade Agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , the Wednesday continued un@@ clear .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
originally a framework for the agreement was to stand at the end of this year .
this date is considered no longer viable .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
in addition to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart pointing to which the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated fol@@ ks@@ ellers have recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen .
the whole audience , about 40 persons , is nearly caught by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he talks about various places he always records on the map , which he reports about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and tender songs .
where they arose and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be wonderfully creative Ir@@ rer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 release and third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clever composed songs that are harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift into great opul@@ ent at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ our arises , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a dist@@ orted series : each of the 50 US states should be appe@@ aled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but already in 2004 and in Rhine @-@ proximity &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect .
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician returns to the series in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Ill@@ ino@@ ise &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
bor@@ dering on ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album enters into the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual list of the influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth record studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b .
since the smaller clubs , the stage shows are here for the colorful spectacle of Ne@@ on @-@ foreh@@ ead @-@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in the dark @-@ held ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although here almost 2000 guests are bath@@ ed in their chairs , the clearly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience you hear : the talk is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disk &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to an enc@@ ore , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed himself modest , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally tends to be under tos@@ sing appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ctions
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected by the prime minister of the Prime Minister
the new Labour president Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s fac@@ ings and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will lift up the first of his six questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be insp@@ ected by the media and the Labour MEPs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the encounter will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C convention on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday , during a commem@@ oration ceremony commemor@@ ated the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , cri@@ es criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the centre of several cover pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ns has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , talked to the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne , regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liament@@ ary Party originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the British correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the European Union &apos;s position and limitation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour should make changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26,@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who promised another policy proposition says he has given &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cro@@ wd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ ctions are to be con@@ front and that he will be subordin@@ ated to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ cken with resistance and instead of concent@@ rating on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow host minister will be represented , if he does not share - for example , when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was able to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ The@@ aters , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ ctions . but a few years later he dre@@ amed that he failed in it .
since she was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questionn@@ aire was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment and his leadership in the sub@@ house and his position among his parliament@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and necess@@ it@@ ates far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound increased br@@ ittle to data , which indicate an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel with this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller building target .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and brought in@@ estim@@ ations at the time of an increase in interest .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climb@@ ed up to 0,@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .

bur@@ berry shares were higher than encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore climb@@ ed 5 % after the mining giant said that it took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of its strategy of debt reduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;

JD Sports increased by 3.1 % after the result of the net sales company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of JD Sports says that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

Met@@ cash launches Boden@@ stan@@ ger@@ kei@@ ts campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - Ein@@ fall
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a bottom line campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is opening two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing about social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA stores and store owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football le@@ ague to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash publ@@ ishes further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment runs its annual investors strategy .
there is much on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores business and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in Eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take about five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retail@@ er sales .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley said that I@@ GA retailers could lose $ 360 million per year and cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base , Met@@ cash could cost around 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the Eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to react publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash received contact Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS market share has declined by 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trading , which has approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operating debt reduction in constant pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the wholes@@ aler is wor@@ rying and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to compare sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week to improve their stores through faster growing fresh food and deliver a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading programs will be upgraded to Elan and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism of his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special Ks , &quot; came into the spot@@ light by the not@@ orious investigation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ inka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ rators , with Har@@ rison cried out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ inka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a Kra@@ mp@@ f failed to win a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I &apos;m quite busy is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drag@@ ged a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a battle in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Cy@@ gi@@ os at the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right for everyone , but it sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed part to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is entirely focused on competition and not all around the controversi@@ es all around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick has made very fast the rise of what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have made . he goes into the eyes of the public , and he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his action . some time outside the ra@@ mp , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , close the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and ri@@ pped the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all firm who tried to go illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed by the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with in@@ dig@@ nation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ strations went up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicop@@ ter ho@@ oked on them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults against the Hungarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deployment police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were returned from Prot@@ est foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would return from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries have to take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence in the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations blo@@ c with a strict meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would make that the EU countries would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put his hopes on a fast action from Brussels or from its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the not@@ orious not@@ with@@ standing in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could shut down roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ uns , which led the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher sentences for convi@@ cted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared a state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ person Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected next week , but rep@@ orters of Associ@@ ated Press have already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already day @-@ to @-@ day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come over by damage the fence , they are now in police cust@@ ody and are accused of receiving criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 was able to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would deny food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over against the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in elections ( 58 per cent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t announced whether he is a candidate for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more constant than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some profits .
Clinton holds a great lead in women and co@@ asts , but these proj@@ ections have decreased .
your support in the men has decreased significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has become volati@@ le , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
but Clinton has a big advantage in the older voters .
last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the elections nation@@ wide say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons are the latest supporters , especially of her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - just a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Repub@@ lican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want it is the candidate , the most common answer is that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
consent to dealing with the problems and the vot@@ ings are also cited .
as the vice @-@ president thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters will see him in the race - although one third believes he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides to channel not for the nom@@ ination of demo@@ crats , Hill@@ ary Clinton increases his lead in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bees in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has dropped by 78 percent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den has a second at this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ fish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the vot@@ er .
similarly as last month , there is no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ er of elections as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics among voters in the sel@@ ections of their party .
maj@@ orities look at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts the best in the three candidates at hon@@ esty while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 per cent have no opinion of him .
democratic voters in general elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , approximately one quarter of the democratic elec@@ tors have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton continue to use a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an external minister , most of the Democratic voters of the preliminary elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans now are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on their general opinions on Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deteri@@ or@@ ated .
it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views are worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as hon@@ estly and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 per cent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time 55 percent of the voting rights nation@@ wide also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump still receive good notes on leadership .
from the six tested Candi@@ dates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the previous elections is 6 percentage points . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ben Car@@ son moves close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the country &apos;s survey
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close to Donald Tr@@ ump
on the two candidates , half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Repub@@ lican voters continue to support nation@@ wide tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month to 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fired at the same time of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under repub@@ lican voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins governor Scott Walker , who has fallen in the deepest , with 10 % support in the last month now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % on the third place .
the error margin in the sample sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Repub@@ lican voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises to surveys - he lands with 19 % support in re@@ public@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
with a view of a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ eves for former neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ umps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign show in Io@@ wa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing lovers to find even warm water .
a bath in North and Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is 25 degrees in France , 23 degrees in France .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood loaded with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ous ritual of a student relationship in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges are filed against five people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ der@@ schaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Den@@ g during an introdu@@ ctory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police shared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 pound pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target over a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ ache , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and supp@@ os@@ edly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to contact his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , Poli@@ sig@@ ef Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members of U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien began to hide and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood basically about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Den@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Poli@@ sig@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ si@@ eve , Den@@ g has repeatedly added strength injuries to head , tor@@ so and thig@@ h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the sham@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies at the sham@@ ans every year since 1970 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for the first five members for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of violent attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the people involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or in@@ official - this is sanc@@ tioned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked her affili@@ ation to the local group .
that will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest
a interest rate comes , and the house will fall into the wake , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only low guidance on the process .
a recession occurred within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed that investors should not concentrate on raising interest rates , but rather on the period required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that all excitement could be exagger@@ ated because of interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to this , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rates can make things volati@@ le for a while .
once the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets yield 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a more recent study to what happens after interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more detail , the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average yield in the last six years , with an average yield of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis conducted by Bob D@@ oll , chief plant o@@ at@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the stocks tend to occur later in the growth cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rates since 1950 had only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and disc@@ ard the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could gain an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the hei@@ gh@@ tened cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum in the GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essions are rapidly placed after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .

the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
when bor@@ rowing , the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the ascent cycle , the leaders immediately drop , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to bringing ren@@ di@@ tes closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atter of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ ser in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting , Jones believes that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stri@@ c@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit ten@@ sion@@ ers have expanded and the volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy .
in the large and entire company , companies that deal with the greater part of their business operations in the USA will benefit if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive .
multination@@ als with high debt will be worse , as a rising dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will become a major problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will most lose , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings could see profits by higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how fast it will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s conserv@@ atives critic@@ ised the sender because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he argued that he is not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .

Parliament @-@ Kolle@@ ge Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading parliamentary committee and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that does not do the private sender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public law radi@@ os@@ ender &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer differs from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; fool@@ ish &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also zi@@ pped the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards launched last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Manager rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and enligh@@ tenment .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m not going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commissioned new works , I really consider it important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to work was to engage the audience when it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for it under fire , to step up commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced &quot; in special BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time is an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to excl@@ ude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at the slo@@ west and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slo@@ wed down the issues
for over a decade , virtual shopping has been dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say that there are indications that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
overall expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of IM@@ RG sales decl@@ ines to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to purchase purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that happens , and we may experience that growth decreases .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decre@@ asing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers came around their computer to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyer fights for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 £ spent a slightly more than 1 £ online .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of men buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are borne by Muslims in the first fun@@ eral par@@ ables in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part of the huge S@@ audi@@ an Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 39@@ 4 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims assembled when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the track to respect her respect , when the first of the dead entered her last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ Renaissance cemetery .
the mour@@ ning proc@@ ession passed on to the Holy Site , where only days before a construction crane was over@@ thrown by the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for fun@@ eral , when the Saudi King over the construction company of the Bin Laden due to the catastrophe , which left 39@@ 4 injured , a san@@ ction hang@@ ed .
the bodies of 29 bet@@ s who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mo@@ sch@@ ee Mek@@ kas , were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi @-@ officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city continue .
today king Sal@@ man said that the bin Laden group would not have to stand the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership is not allowed to travel abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man praised that which caused the fall of the crane who crashed into a courtyard of the Grand Cher@@ ry , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were held before H@@ add@@ sch , which later took place this month .
the bin Laden group has no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal decree also imp@@ eded the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ kas Gros@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project led by the bin Laden group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to the master family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over greater construction projects .
the dec@@ e@@ ased leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was kid@@ n@@ apped by the family in 1990 &apos;s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injured are half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European crafts@@ men is over
British employ increasingly arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe has a rise behind
this causes 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at crafts@@ men
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nation@@ wide
by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of Daily Mail
it is claimed that Brit@@ ons put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified East European crafts@@ men who carry out work in their homes .
if you &apos;re sent sk@@ ill@@ fully with a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority today .
for the British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to perform DIY jobs in their houses , so the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices , is now out@@ dated .
this is why King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that focus on crafts@@ men and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it is necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also changed its top team to reflect a similar number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial status .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our super@@ visory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and revenues , after the group debt the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / Do@@ b because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , Kl@@ agen@@ furt took two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball champion A@@ ich / Do@@ b for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and for@@ gab@@ ility .
the accused were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of am@@ pling abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the State At@@ tor@@ ney Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the pre @-@ examination that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 until 2011 were Gel@@ der of Verein@@ skon@@ ten , which they were allowed to disp@@ oni@@ ze in their functions , for private purposes .
it damages the damage of around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports function@@ aries are also accused of financial institutions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence was that the association had not created an asset in any time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports function@@ aries would have been calcul@@ ating expenditure damages and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the Passi@@ va took about 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) in 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we carry on the club further or block us ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brot@@ vocation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the finance minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , unless you have made any debt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the pay@@ out of the expenses for expenses declined to 1991 in case of corresponding financial success .
therefore , you have paid a portion of the expenses only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus has been paid to the account .
therefore , breaks and non @-@ detail bookings seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and savings manuals managed the two def@@ endants together , said the second def@@ endant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdrawal has not been revealed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is not interested in the details of finance , important is only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association account in 2011 .
these were resi@@ dences , the def@@ endants explained .
this securities account was on the name of the second def@@ endant and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
then he said finally , he believed that this was the best for the association .
if something happened to him , nobody would have knew anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed , the function@@ aries justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensation in@@ dem@@ nity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why poll@@ ut@@ ants ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first def@@ endant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the func@@ tionary , he has never covered a cent salary , he only calculated mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at di@@ ets he charged the association 1,000 euros a month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
accurate documents for the early years could not show the def@@ endants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are after an operational check , in which everything has been judged as correctly , they explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mil@@ eage was also related to the second def@@ endant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all Beh@@ eb@@ rations are in cash , so he had to go to the Bank of the international market to the Bank in Blei@@ burg , in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard st@@ alls more 30,000 jobs
in addition , for three years of ongoing personnel mining , the computer giant will be able to disman@@ tle further jobs while spl@@ itting the company .
the sub@@ missions of the HP computer ri@@ esen Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not find an end .
in the context of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to reduce the reduction of 25,@@ 000 to 30,000 jobs in its company &apos;s business segment .
this will save costs in the amount of EUR 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , divided the company on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special load of around 2.6 billion dollars , which will drop in the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reduction of 55@@ .000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 .
the Hewlett @-@ Packard share was 2.3 percent .
the company with printers from the California Pal@@ o Alto is currently spl@@ itting up : thus the computer and print business will still be bund@@ led in a new society - separate from the prospective areas with computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .

time of decision on interest rates for the US Emer@@ gency Database
the world is watching when the U.S. Emer@@ gency is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time the interest has been raised for almost a decade or not .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
it is an historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest has been on N@@ ULL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , Head of Staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is added to a relatively good performance level , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less harsh outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
die Todes@@ schüt@@ ze an der Delta State University
after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues later on the day and killed - Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to make it happen , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for ge@@ ography and social scientific education at Delta State University , called emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shot at someone and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb said to the staff of the emergency call to send police polic@@ emen to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers according to his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could undo it .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ angular relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said they were married about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter that is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had possessed a dog called Light@@ ning for about three years with Lamb .
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb has called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , Lamb left his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doct@@ orate in the spring of 2015 by the Delta State University as his li@@ fest@@ y@@ les on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa plans a large Group conversion .
a half billion euros per year will save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s approximately 1,000 managers worldwide will cost the workplace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the pilot union there is no new negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the Euro@@ wings cheap to@@ vers .
the aim of real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of around 500 million euros a year from cost and rede@@ mption sy@@ ner@@ gies , the airline reported on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , the Lufthansa will no longer be responsible for the passenger business in future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Euro@@ wings bil@@ lig@@ flu@@ x line should be developed as independent as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
in the future , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .

new negotiations with the pilots

this shared the union with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of talks should be the retirement regulation for pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transi@@ tional supply of the pilots , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that Lufthansa in the fight against competi@@ tor routes to the Group &apos;s own cheap airline Euro@@ wings is lag@@ ging . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play Mon@@ days for Double Fra@@ ktur
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ cture of his right leg with the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PSV Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this won the left @-@ hand def@@ ender to we@@ ep and excl@@ ude him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was built into the PSV area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg fra@@ cture and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then played fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker cabin he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a Red Card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack on both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I get stronger again . &quot;
in this regard : Manchester United suff@@ ers from the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of the PSV
the UK &apos;s def@@ ender has an additional incen@@ tive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PSV @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that there is a very bad violation , this is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ B@@ S@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad at the moment . I &apos;m sorry .
the PSV player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost mem@@ ori@@ ously .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided to be the environmental f@@ ables of Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems to always be a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron report@@ edly describes the story of the book , instead of re @-@ giving a content of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , meets the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love @-@ interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was silent and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this is not yet susp@@ icious : the text presented by Cameron reads as part of the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is not familiar with the plot of the book . here an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the cas@@ u@@ ary , trees , falls fru@@ str@@ ating , Th@@ need stri@@ cken once @-@ ler , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who has not read the Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ man said that the text probably came from Camer@@ ons ballo@@ oning office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons employees was delivered , but there was no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult

the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks in difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that critics are ge@@ ared towards results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said this - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
a long time ago he had extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully strikes further acqu@@ isitions for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss pra@@ ises his stance , even if he did not bring so good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test stroke receives to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and back@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first made Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a perc@@ ussi@@ onist that I set up highly .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends of course on the team &apos;s position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ spin and would get four qui@@ cks , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s player from cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that lift up their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as advis@@ er for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously said .
coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team @-@ makers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could win to Zul@@ u if the economy was in a built @-@ in machine by 2017 .
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ wi@@ dened new negoti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of the in@@ geni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states , so deeply fru@@ str@@ ated in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of its own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disturb@@ ing contractual changes that they usually do not want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Self@@ ie Agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European boy@@ friend who wishes a great Britain inside the EU - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and shows that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as it looks for the excessive long out@@ har@@ r@@ ents such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ass@@ uring force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Self@@ ie British , whose energy should be used to prevent Scotland from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even plan un@@ clear remarks , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , I susp@@ ect my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re @-@ negoti@@ ation was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain won &apos;t win anything from the new trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how r@@ äu@@ ber@@ ish the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press level , as they did not have been inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s .
in all his mad@@ ness Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sh@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners who have most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought similar about her but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better ban@@ anas spread to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Bl@@ air himself when he opposed Camer@@ ons &apos;s referendum , because Bl@@ air had put the principle on the non @-@ adopted Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press has never for@@ given him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on the back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need more time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ k@@ ott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ year , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe - I express it very friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ tendency and the wild bra@@ ids of Tor@@ y Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet without losing too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under all circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow workers and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ ause on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a Brut@@ stätte of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks this way .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ ui@@ ties on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , which is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ ui@@ ties to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son &apos;s fel@@ sen@@ fest convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be oblig@@ ated to try , in particular , to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin turn political capital , - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something that was called British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful to smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the res@@ ili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which PH@@ E established its most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision @-@ making analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to introduce their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director previously received British American Tob@@ acco means ( BAT ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ wrote the references from BAT to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing which he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include a sector financing in paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting the Tab@@ ak line was attended by PH@@ E .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ essed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the PH@@ E report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of PH@@ E that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at PH@@ E , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addi@@ ction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System 2 billion pounds per year .
by clear preliminary evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we carry out our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ enders , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making them public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried six years at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least do your production at least on programs that do not make or put on behalf .
they send The Voice in a first class time window because they want to achieve a broad support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it is ridi@@ culous , it is natural non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm to it .
I would like to see myself how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think that this would decrease the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; due to the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of BBC give back what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how East@@ enders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue if they are going to go on their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ struc@@ tional programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the board : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you think everyone , we all think that one receives a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who is a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that &apos;s right , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , urged the BBC to review and maintain their Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , only little of BBC production would now be classified as education - he said it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it was supposed to change and talk to the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC , should do more in areas like the pro@@ ms of which he said that only a hand@@ ful on television will be shown , and with commercial broadcasting alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Son@@ o@@ genetics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can control brain cells through sound waves &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they have high frequencies with sound impulses used for human hearing to be heard .
the impulses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ asound waves .
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultr@@ asound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease .
thread wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani confirmed that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ asound waves , which then penet@@ rate into wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asound waves affect structures which are called TR@@ P 4 ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the dice cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion@@ ic channels and activate the cells they are assigned to such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P 4 ion channels .
when it turns ultr@@ asound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transfer into wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to enter and turn neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent down on a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily susp@@ end the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

according to G@@ avin Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lectur@@ er at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries .
many artists do themselves with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapons trade posters sal@@ ute the comm@@ uter in the subway .
the am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the V@@ C@@ CP advertising agency , which works for free with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ eover artist who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was aston@@ ished about the silence that ruled around the advertising for the weapons fair - through a Le@@ erst@@ elle of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic fashion advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a step of the British government and the guarantee that tort@@ uring devices are not tra@@ ded in front of our front door .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors are fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for life in student residence
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I went to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residence ranges from easily ner@@ ven@@ ing up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ ouse : people tell where you are , whether and where you have taken Sabbath year , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it dire@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak even if your las@@ hes were burning in fire and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would be .
allow people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks recep@@ tions , film night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I can get the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow milit@@ ant is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead .
apro@@ pos pos : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through baking .
as you begin the university on the highlight of the back @-@ mania , the kno@@ ck is at the doors of people to introduce themselves to a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less stran@@ gely than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &apos; welcome in the neighborhood , I have baked them . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;

terra@@ ced houses for refugees , seclu@@ ded , straight @-@ deser@@ ving
the real estate contractor Markus Gil@@ dner builds on the mid @-@ fr@@ än@@ k@@ ischen Eck@@ ental terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ger@@ ing@@ thi@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how one can still build and build today &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will be pushing to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : it builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will be pushing to the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or Turn@@ h@@ allen has no sustainability .
for people remain in a large part here .
in view of the refugee flow , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a semi @-@ detached house needs the least place .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different if you put the people in blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees say it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be modified according to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is up to 184 000 euros , without plot .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is reasonable .
have the construction regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been using my project correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially complicated makes it always the dro@@ h@@ ensive D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the job placement .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it will still be under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no room for this .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not true .
but do not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but they have been built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford one more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees , but also the only educ@@ ating mother or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ger@@ ing@@ thi@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ll show you how to build and build even today .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message that tells the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to handle the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may possibly mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do so , if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the telephone may be dep@@ rec@@ ated on half way , and this could lead to a break@@ out of the updates .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded three months ago , has added another member in its ranks , thus increasing the membership number to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who held more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the bear@@ er of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st class and hon@@ orary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kamp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation supported by Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot record the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes for membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ udi@@ s and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have merged under the man@@ tle of the Social Foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides consult@@ ations you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely , at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there was recently opened a new Qu@@ arti@@ san office .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , you will receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as care insurance or services of health and nursing homes .
for years we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often nur@@ turing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are not rarely many services of the cas@@ ks , because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amadeus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consult@@ ations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ san office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ udi@@ s was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers from the Senior Center and the Sal@@ udi@@ s complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Senior Center for Care and Care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Heike Rie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ udi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre see both business leaders particularly in demo@@ graphic change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this is a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) at the inaugur@@ ation fes@@ tivities , the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro also dedic@@ ates itself to the association at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite to a regular soci@@ able subsi@@ dy . &quot;
this makes the Social Foundation a major contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the Qu@@ arti@@ san office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 am to 6 pm and Satur@@ days from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ year passed away
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on September 5th at the age of 92 , like the Künstler@@ haus on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus lost an hon@@ orary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was in the broadcast .
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann .
since 1952 he worked as a freel@@ ance architect , but was also active as a teacher , writer and institute manager .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s , he was commissioned with the institution of the treas@@ ury in the Vienna Hof@@ burg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .

he wants to have added 30 kil@@ ograms of muscle mass according to his own statement in the past two years .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the town of Bremen one confirms the accus@@ ations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it from the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I decided whether me@@ adow is displayed , or not .

men tested on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses seek the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now cried to the young people and struck this with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al break and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he left his victim first .
from his friends the injured young man was now brought home .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with a car up to the apartment and went there several times over there .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle anymore , the injured person went before the building to smoke a cigar@@ ette .
there he was again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
under the help of a stroke , one checked on the face and the thig@@ h of the victim .
the last had to be brought to a hospital for medical care .
until now there is only a v@@ ague trial description .
one of the men was about 1.80 m tall .
the second bat should have been around 1.@@ 65 meters large and was clo@@ thed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and exec@@ ution@@ ers to report on the phone number 06@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich und Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
in addition , Sam@@ t@@ gemeinde may@@ master Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , has luck . Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field breaks on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros into the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll met with his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently under@@ went their vocational training at the Ver@@ dener Hospital and also wants to go into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the Müll@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was , I simply called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple of Müller liked the idea to practice their own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he can see his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the two @-@ fold family @-@ father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed a leading emergency doctor in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is committed hon@@ orary in the DR@@ K readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a practi@@ tioner , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) speci@@ alis@@ es in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle as a pet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the reconstruction , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ asound examinations as well as long @-@ term and res@@ ili@@ ent EK@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
a supplement of a total of 500@@ 00 euros will receive the Müll@@ ers as part of a subsi@@ dy programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes Sam@@ t@@ Community Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , about 2000 patients come into practice field breaks , in the north German average practice it is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another house practice .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor was found , she would also have gone .
anyone who visits Müll@@ ers Sprech@@ stunde also looks forward to all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the fields of the field .
with their par@@ ting ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the medical professionals have practiced for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little sad@@ ness felt it after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; your husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I always pressed myself from gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also driven at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that everyone who wants an asylum application will also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people are in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it takes clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia considers &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to travel to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
in this way , the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians don &apos;t want to mar@@ ry its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday , in east of the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the near ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles are constantly meeting with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country with around 4000 refugees , said Minister of Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Ser@@ b border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , agreed to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was to propose certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we nor do we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were traveling all night from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia around 500 kilometres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in this way , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could actually come to a slightly further west distance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic pointed out that his country was prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call for details , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extensive opportunities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently demonstrated a good testimony to the country , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade media reports they had spent the past night at the border crossing HOR@@ GOS , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings HOR@@ GOS and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel on the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local eye in HOR@@ GOS : he will keep the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be about very high refugee numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their trip over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - Alternati@@ v@@ rou@@ ten
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute land cards on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still not yet cleared min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatian territory .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian Police announced that a team of min@@ e@@ ers was sent to the border region .
Bör@@ sen @-@ Hacker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Su@@ pran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber crimin@@ als that is accused of having gained insight into yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire .
with the exploited information , insi@@ ders are to be made at the financial markets .
in this way , the investig@@ ators had a total of more than 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other accused in the event lasted .
most of the accused origin@@ ate from Ukraine and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rators shall have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim has been working for 20 years
around the Mann@@ heimer Par@@ ade@@ platz there is active operation .
people do their concerns , partly quick pac@@ es , partly comfortably stroll .
they control the two stations of the Mann@@ heimer Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep the city rail@@ ways .
pul@@ s@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with glorious autumn sun and middle rin four large tables each with the heading &quot; Before I &quot; I want to die .... &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce subsi@@ ded with this action on her 20 @-@ year anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about life , so we are with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available to the pass@@ ers as well as questions and talks like the volunteer staff .
while man@@ ch interfer@@ es spont@@ aneously to the chal@@ k and can read the sentence &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; to stop the war , &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , &quot; others remain in short , reading , say pro@@ positions as &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again , there are little discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make sure that for me the end is coming to this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband der Ö@@ kum@@ en@@ ischen Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for 20 year olds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , that not everyone wants to publicly share on the tablets , but be understand@@ able , finally it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still aff@@ licted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the fact that people open up .
an assessment that shares Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id .
the death and mour@@ ning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read much literature and decided to get involved in the steri@@ li@@ zation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was sought by the call of volunteers , they were immediately reported and had been involved in the foundation in 1995 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and Hos@@ pi@@ z Sankt Vincent .
they all have been carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id can deal well with her task and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see the life of another waiting , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ atory ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and den@@ omin@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance and donations of relatives and associations enables training as well as training and super@@ visions of the death and mour@@ ning .
all two years are offered training courses for new employees .
the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protest@@ ant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
also there can be further personal wishes on post@@ cards .
Fed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lo@@ wered
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply gig@@ ant accounts for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ b transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ .000 seasonal workers on holiday .
at this time , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,90 $ in the financial year that ends in May next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which will amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher supplements for bo@@ ating transport of heavy and large packages that are collected from November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it was nevertheless expected that the result was increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and because of growth in online retail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid yields &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one considers the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for rent employment were announced a day later than that of the Ri@@ val U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 95@@ .000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex deser@@ ved $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to EUR 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion euros .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts expected 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
in recent years Fed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping that brought sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results with Fed@@ Ex Ground .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in freight business .
in pre@@ market trading , about one hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on the most awa@@ ited meeting in the year Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time to lift the wom@@ b for the first time .
threatening over them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey meeting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold contract from Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. occupation and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the unprecedented incen@@ tive by the close short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets might be anxi@@ ous to rein@@ force these volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty about the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is uns@@ ett@@ led to the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists ques@@ tioned recently by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
however , the financial markets expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the share market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promise that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Do@@ w Jones Industrial mean value sp@@ rang up by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have to go very far in their declaration to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t get into panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed is going to deal .
still a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required to increase the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wed down , improvement on the labour market was solid in this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world rede@@ emed at the end of the last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Do@@ w Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value dropped by more than 16 % in May when investors feared that a slow@@ down in Chinese economy would increase global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , while the Do@@ w is now almost 10 % below the H@@ och of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influence complex calculation when one should raise interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred during the last few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Emer@@ gency Database . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predi@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in their decision making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Fund has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere note of the former Lei@@ ters Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow their mon@@ et@@ ary expansion , &quot; dissolved confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected that they will not only monitor the developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
l@@ acker , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ated for an interest rate , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its loan to 0,75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recogni@@ zable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Levin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only put aspects of financial stability to the first place during a serious crisis like the market collapse in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee for Inter@@ est Sett@@ lement of Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation where they fear of interest , because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think that they should advance the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small living for refugees
more and more refugees come to Germany this day .
to prepare a warm welcome , do not go without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
she still likes to teach her 74 L@@ enzen .
every Thursday she is doing it in asylum seek@@ ers at the Dill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course , it is quite different from other classes than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization Spr@@ S tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding is . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck to breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make .
a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bavarian Sp@@ orth@@ alle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the contract for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ long@@ ed Turn@@ hall@@ en@@ bau at the mountain@@ ous sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in recent congreg@@ ational sessions , the elabor@@ ated construction application was lo@@ wered without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the committee had decided on an application for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid building plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission of a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ es first and roof@@ top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liber@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof incl@@ ination that is prescribed for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the building plan does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the roof slope - with the ber@@ n@@ rie@@ der Gemein@@ der@@ at as a rule in the rule of liberation movements rather restri@@ ctive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the building is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Turn@@ hall@@ en@@ bau at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
at the expense of around 2.3 million Euros are calculated .
subsidies are expected from school and public transport promotion .
in the next process , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the Land@@ rat@@ samt .
Klinik Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this will see the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confir@@ ming the Land@@ rä@@ tin Andrea Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on the Supervisory Board , however , will make a decision on the next Wednesday , 23 September .
should plans be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital .
the vast majority should move with fishermen and the further interior Station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who do not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Weil@@ heim , so Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change to the dism@@ iss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Clinic since the beginning of the year , has now moved to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1st , and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in the interior Station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to agree both houses , until then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , is to be closed to Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the District Apostle had planned this for 2018 if the currently ongoing rehabilitation is completed at the hospital in Weil@@ heim .
Land@@ rä@@ tin Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the super@@ visory board , came to meet the rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Federal Reserve , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am asleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , Joch@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ term maintenance of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Bes@@ ser@@ es could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer over the quasi @-@ rel@@ ocation to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a principal doctor for more than 30 years , have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s colleagues to take on the post of the medical director .
the hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( formerly 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure over the past decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are called tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .

hunting dun@@ geon with two injured in Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest in the afternoon by shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ ize field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police shared .
after a shot of shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was initially un@@ clear .
the Krimin@@ al@@ poli@@ zei was determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of non @-@ violence
a crime susp@@ ect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to kill the young people and threw their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
one since Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to violence .
the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and police on Wednesday .
as a susp@@ icious one also applies to 20 @-@ year @-@ old on Tuesday evening , which is indeed the indication , and the investig@@ ators lead to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning after having arrived at home after a visit of a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen as agreed upon .
in search of a young woman the investig@@ ators first bite on personal objects of the victim .
in case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances , there was finally a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authorities , the public authorities were admitted to the police inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put the cor@@ pse into the canal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ tri@@ chter on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead weight .
the investigation of the near@@ er circumstances of the fact is to bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns against housing gap
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market grows .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with income weak citizens around the last affordable housing .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , every year 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the association of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year 260@@ .000 units are completed in Germany .
in this way , 140@@ .000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an original accommodation .
many come to the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the rented apartments .
according to the Federal Office of Statistics , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany sho@@ ots a housing deficit from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , some 7@@ 0,000 units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ained Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals lived therefore in large cities with not@@ ches in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the built @-@ in on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has decreased for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incen@@ tives are to boost social housing construction again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could be avoided at the Gr@@ under@@ wer@@ bs@@ Tax and the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments could be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , according to the alliance , attractive tax de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation possibilities are necessary .
the funding programme for refugee meetings of the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start was announced on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available around 300 million euros .
now the project could even be raised .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set the cor@@ ridor
after Hungary is practically no passing through , there are more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia .
Zagreb announces the transit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
however , the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior and when it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian interior minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees fled to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary had sail@@ ed its border to refugees on the day of the day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new laws that came into force on the same day make excessive asylum procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary .
Croatia wants to leave the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had seized the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in Croatia .
most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d both by bus and by tax@@ is .
immediately after their arrival , they had tried to get on foot over the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter border f@@ ences .
there are other dangers in this way : there are sharp mines from the Yug@@ oslav civil war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the closing of the border , no more refugees come to Hungary after closing the border .
on Tuesday the police numbered 366 people .
shortly before the door closed on Monday there were still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws ampli@@ fy the over@@ coming and damage of the border judge as a crime .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the condemned thre@@ aten sentences of up to five years and the dep@@ ortation from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority , one received a total of 94 asylum applications on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ onen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the exhibitors , 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no one has a prospect of granted asylum in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the past asylum seek@@ ers should be dep@@ orted there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
they gathered the gar@@ bage , leaving tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks .
pl@@ ywood has been disman@@ tled and one of the intru@@ ders in the border was rebuilt .
to the goal of this change , nobody wanted to express themselves .
after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants , however , were still in the country .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities on the morning .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing regularly , smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor of the border &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gest@@ rand@@ ete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy on Sunday with the clearing , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had surprisingly set off the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow in Austria , Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance and the rocks together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed the border into Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before we have tast@@ ed the un@@ hoped guests only once , with snack and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disp@@ uted train passengers were switched on Sunday evening in Wels by a ICE train in a regional train direction Pass@@ au , after the short notice that the railway traffic was adjusted to Germany , but still to try across the border .
but the regional train was turned off at the Inn at the Inn of Wern@@ stein .
in Wern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge firmly joined the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , on the day before a bridge run sporty - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending more tens of thousands to us , is a logical conclusion of a hypo@@ critical policy :
rather than in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately at the establishment of structures to help humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially opened the position of the Hungarian government into the area of National Soci@@ alism .
guiding these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the p@@ oultry will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee flows and the approaching winter , in order to establish decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35,@@ 000 winter@@ proof quar@@ rying
Konrad has all hands to do with the refugee service .
Christian Konrad is ac@@ custom@@ ed to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers in order to provide lod@@ g@@ ings for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already gotten a grip on the chaos in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &apos;s first recording centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great wor@@ ries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Interior Ministry spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad expects 85@@ .000 Quar@@ ters in the he@@ uris@@ ing year .
in order to meet the number , 35,@@ 000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 shall provide the countries , 15,000 the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already conducted talks with the leaders of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him to create lod@@ g@@ ings for the coming refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it runs well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born and will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; big expectations of the Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator also set up the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , private persons can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emer@@ gen@@ cies , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ders have to comply with a certain amount of the towel holder or size of the superi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for temporary time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as opposed to the Interior Ministry , he founded Konrad with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ ve power is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the republic no cost as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not successful until now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container on Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since it is currently possible to accommodate the affected persons without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the emergency , however , further locations should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism exer@@ ts the head of the city on the division of refugees within the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other districts have to make their contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has ac@@ counted for further action in the refugee question on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any more .
however , the seeker @-@ seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria has again brought up controls to its borders is a logical result for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the procedure of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T has entered , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine investing in startup companies in the new shi@@ py@@ ard , and later on which to be ac@@ qui@@ eted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Land Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of resi@@ dual surface in the building are already rented , for further 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the heart of the new shop .
in fact Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to settle a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she now got an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories costs up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously , several weeks have been modified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long over@@ laid whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the nati@@ ves in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has put out Br@@ eit from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I feel most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in decoration , the specialist will not be able to answer with the latest safety .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag is recycled every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
this property also bin@@ ds with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants to become .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he expresses himself hostile to alien@@ ating journalists or reve@@ aling knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the applicant for the U.S. presidential office wir@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate are desc@@ ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fris@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related over -@@ zig corners with it .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ terin Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , become a mighty man of the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous Spr@@ öss@@ lings , to which besides Tr@@ ump also the k@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for fal@@ seh@@ ood , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tends to say that Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a little bit too la@@ zy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to high @-@ German : the investors , says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ger .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a loc@@ ale for gold dig@@ gers in the US .
the corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate company were first property purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to homeland , failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then .
he did not record tr@@ ump because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Geschichte and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ ration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is in contrast to the not@@ orious statements of the descendants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the pol@@ ishing , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relationship of tr@@ umps ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the Americans rather dis@@ soci@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ ushing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump arrives ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pen@@ sions@@ wir@@ tin Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz ended with a visit to the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine the Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is better if he does not know the choice because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the days of his grand@@ father in the United States would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Bü@@ hler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , inter@@ viewed for the tr@@ ump , has seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ än@@ ger , even in the USA the interest is awak@@ ened .

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no big shifts in the ratings for Today .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the German capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ antha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a single week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed not to play a role for Australian TV spectators , since Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five capitals , compared with today 3@@ 39@@ .000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ .000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
in August Today we reached an average of 3@@ 18,@@ 000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the gap between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 .
so far in September Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9,@@ 000 spectators at 3@@ 14,@@ 000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of the change concern these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently swe@@ ating father , who decided to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 219 million spectators .
critics had asked whether Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and struck slightly The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26,@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery unveil@@ ed ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly apparently who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , finally lan@@ det at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girl will certainly not give up if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you may be mistakenly given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds his lips down to the final on Thursday
all three women have settled in the ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and recognized his sense of hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you who should get Woods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they could become their answers to the game of playing who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly realized - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and saw the energies ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I &apos;ve thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it makes so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; the one . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this obviously is not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ conditional on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to choose whom he should choose , if not she , she was mysterious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is an un@@ decided between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost an angel as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ vert with his first p@@ unt return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly at his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ er Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed mu@@ zzle and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian favor for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut at that time in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ store the cl@@ aw , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ anger requested the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it existed during Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it does not go further , we have to stick to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ tor@@ ate boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so Ai@@ w@@ anger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the FW @-@ Chef critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need nation@@ wide unified standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria hi@@ ves away , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more hand@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the state policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a long @-@ standing tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the education policy .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the FW boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 People killed after polic@@ emen shoot blank@@ ets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police compl@@ ained in a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , chief executive officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of you threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot into the air before returning to rubber floor .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used blank@@ ets , of which it is known to be able to kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would decrease their political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus , who want to own their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were held in violent disputes since the 10th .
August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been centrally regulated for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature acceler@@ ates the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature voted for this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the interest , the medium @-@ sized company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP group , who warned investors and management sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends passed from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ours now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , the roughly ten to twelve million Euros has been in discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent reactions among marine land@@ owners who came to the meeting were called the pictures and new details for the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and board member of the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z who over@@ looks all the other bones . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears as many other project critics that the traffic would greatly increase by the intended size of the facility : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all bus charges must come so that it expects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is happening on the well a hect@@ are area of the former host , however , is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a concl@@ usive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to aid the thousands of refugees who over@@ rolled the European nations as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google assistant who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey belonged to many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing aid for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / will be doubled to 11 million $ .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

reporting of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AMA Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss operations or obes@@ ity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obes@@ ity operations have proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital dates , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two kinds of obes@@ ity surgery - Mag@@ enb@@ yp@@ ass and gast@@ ric sleep training - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I under those who undergo this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who did not @-@ surgical diabetes treatment were approximately equal to 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , at 36 % the diabetes disorder is completely and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , compared to diabetes , diabetes is only dissolved in one percent and partially only about two percent .
in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ins , &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also a@@ wo@@ ke the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood glucose values over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels decreased by around 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - does not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the guiding researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the host rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , higher returns in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who undergo an obes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soo@@ thing for people with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obes@@ ity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot absorb all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis was in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader promp@@ ted to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke to the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries ad@@ mits to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we have to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented George B@@ ush@@ s &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 and set out that the violent reaction of the US moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after 11 September I expressed my p@@ ity in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase from inf@@ ectious dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
po@@ ison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of swal@@ lo@@ wing the strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of recei@@ pts of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children rose under 12 years of age , the po@@ ison control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation of social media .
video on YouTube show how you@@ ths dis@@ inf@@ ect dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
young people have supp@@ os@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be angel@@ ed by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very attractive for children .
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children , a few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ruf@@ zentrum in the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave swal@@ lo@@ wing whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a fast way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ hai@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four spra@@ yers from after straw@@ berry frag@@ rant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
their blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ hai@@ jah felt her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors super@@ vised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma because the girl fell by the alcohol and pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lo@@ wing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an ingredient .
in January , three students planned the fourth class in the state of New York to det@@ oxi@@ fy their &quot; common &quot; teacher by laying anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the ver@@ icy plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gesch@@ wä@@ tz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and instru@@ cted disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in case of a rear accident , a 33 @-@ year car driver has been injured in a rear accident at the cross @-@ p@@ liers between Nordr@@ ing and on Her@@ mes .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross @-@ section towards the round@@ about industrial area and took too late that at the round@@ about two prec@@ eded vehicles had stopped .
in the episode , he boun@@ ced into the rear of an audi@@ s with his lor@@ ry and whether this vehicle is at a front in front of the Ford Fi@@ esta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the accident @-@ participating vehicles , property damage was about 10 000 euros , the police shares with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready and had to be dep@@ orted .
rum@@ or C@@ ells : no di@@ shar@@ mony at Celtic
Griff@@ i@@ ths is playing the talk of di@@ shar@@ mony at Celtic Glas@@ gow , D@@ eil@@ a indicates that the Ho@@ ops stand on a bad place , but that he will turn it again .
HE@@ AR@@ TS will fight against N@@ eil@@ son because of accus@@ ation of N@@ eil@@ son and war@@ bur@@ ton will be cau@@ tious in January @-@ new obligations that could destroy the unity of the cad@@ re
D@@ ons raise guidance on Celtic to five points
Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ de@@ en a scar@@ ce victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays Ger@@ ede about di@@ shar@@ mony
there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mony at Celtic Glas@@ gow , which was spont@@ aneously dismis@@ sed by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think that we feel under pressure , I think the players look forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football matches Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former rank@@ player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here not only talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will rot@@ ate things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things .
after the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ de@@ en , who now stood at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had a bad times before , and we will come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly so - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the player better .
now together , it is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously at January @-@ transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago that pointed out that he hur@@ ried a couple of January transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is careful with the signing of new ones and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
CELTIC @-@ target person mich@@ u with reference point
Sw@@ an@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw his contract with Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pl@@ agu@@ ed with an anno@@ ying ank@@ le for two years and did not manage the departure from Wales in this summer .
HE@@ AR@@ TS on S@@ FA battle due to N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts performed 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ erson was sent from the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Def@@ ender was later removed - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um that was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said , and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the un@@ improved Hi@@ bee was assigned after he admitted to have a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Rud@@ i Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is certain to say that I don &apos;t return to ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glas@@ gow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Donn@@ el@@ ly insi@@ sts that the board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to rot@@ ate things - but is that the decline in the field must end .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Donn@@ el@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ In@@ es cle@@ ars that his crew had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive le@@ ague victory that brought them a lead of five points before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ In@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won everything in poker games or songs that won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it is increasing in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period of May until July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Schot@@ t@@ land &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ Ks of 5.5 percent , such as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) .
in the meantime , the occupation in Scotland fell by 12,@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,@@ 000 .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken bo@@ ther@@ ed the procedure
since the security personnel could not grant the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pep@@ per@@ al spray the officials could take the stur@@ geon in cust@@ ody .
a breath @-@ alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.89 pro@@ mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2.@@ 15 pro@@ mil@@ le and remained at first in cust@@ ody .
why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
something later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is executed by the poison@@ ous sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I voted .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists can see exec@@ utions in the US , and as often more applications are available as places , a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emoti@@ on@@ less .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh much when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants , and you will get access .
I am compl@@ aining with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she dre@@ amed that she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I &apos;ve done .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters you can use for this .
what you will get from me is what it means to die a man an unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police pursu@@ it persu@@ aded to get out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he was talking to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a domestic peace break in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
master soccer player Ben Cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 Cou@@ sins started his car in the dit@@ ches to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cou@@ sins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to pick him out and threat@@ ens to finish racing .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he focused on the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it went to the positive cob@@ alt @-@ rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; watch out like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have been looking for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it went on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I &apos;d like to go around the head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for her .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before Moo@@ dy had previously tried the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - whom I am asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; Moo@@ dy said on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of Route L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should I think that it is personally ?
did the RV@@ L behave like this , and perhaps people outside of trainers are responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they are thinking about it now .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the training levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he could throw his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ finished Master Black Caviar , marked the day @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse debate , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ ed mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have happened yesterday evening .
it would have been like yesterday the whole day , which was so .
but it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the racing day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one is too far away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a coll@@ ision with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley .
the police said the driver continued to stop without stopping to help the injured driver .
on Monday , a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia became the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be charged because of the driver &apos;s cur@@ sed and underground assistance and because of other traffic conditions .
the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year old man from Cob@@ ram remains in the hospital . it is in a stable state .
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats Riv@@ alen due to claims to Ring@@ battle
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of N@@ RL . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators have allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring fights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bris@@ b@@ ane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a little envel@@ oping note to the Storm team after his team had scored the Final win against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land are not too good in the rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the t@@ ack@@ li@@ m of his team and said that they are only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; when tac@@ kling tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was confident that they were worried that they were worried about being defeated by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring fights when they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing at our def@@ ensive system or techniques throughout the year . however , in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es to a real focus and that has provided for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not getting used to losing it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny how this is getting up again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Ill@@ awar@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play as they play .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are l@@ acks doing and do not score points a bit of ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the game sched@@ ules .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet in one phase .
the Storm team is free at this weekend since they have the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200@@ ,000 $ security deposit
a man who may possibly end@@ ure a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were mu@@ g@@ ated to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 200@@ ,000 $ .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on Yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and put in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police took 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life penalty for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attor@@ ney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café it could have been a harm@@ less reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of danger at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .

Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200@@ ,000 dollars as security to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the elite declar@@ ations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200@@ ,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ ge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .

St@@ ev@@ an Hog@@ g used phone of girls to enti@@ ce P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile to send images
a p@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Hog@@ g took the phone of the girl when this slept , turned into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children that were sent to him by another user .
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hog@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ erts her mother .
the police looked about and saw the five images , analyzed then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used concepts for searching for un@@ decent images of children .
Hog@@ g then claimed the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addi@@ ction - that he was addi@@ cted to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that the search on the computer was carried out by him , but said that it was done because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten P@@ äd@@ oph@@ iles .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and we@@ eping .
she also saw the invisible images on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and play@@ station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Hog@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the indictment , to have accepted un@@ decent pictures of children on the 14th of June of this year , and did not appear before court on 24 March of this year .
defense attor@@ ney Gregor S@@ im asked for Hog@@ g not appear in the register of sexual crimes , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; can be found in his understanding .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mich@@ ael bl@@ ames the verdi@@ ct until October to receive background reports on social work .
Hog@@ g was granted a ple@@ dge in this case , but was kept in cust@@ ody due to hearing in other cases .
he was added before the date of judgment into the directory of sexual crimes .
Schle@@ user devi@@ ates from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are picked up from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ gs left out of fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly on smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
along the border river Inn , Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn have been taken up since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees .
they were on foot over bridges and reser@@ vo@@ irs to the German side .

Stuttgart : runner of Trop@@ enst@@ urm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against Stur@@ mb@@ ö@@ en in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low @-@ pressure zone on Western Europe , warm marine air flows into the country , divided by the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the strong low is the foo@@ th@@ ills of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , the Black Forest is still in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Baltic Sea with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 hours .
on Friday you can see the sun again .
the mass makes it : every two years the builders at the I@@ AA show their novel@@ ties .
2015 is mainly a movement among the compact cars that are currently selling very well .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of the new appro@@ vals were de@@ duc@@ ted according to Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this also reflects on the I@@ AA ( publication stage 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept vehicles and new premium cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
this means that the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel introduces an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in a view that will start at 17 650 Euro .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 litre engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse also offer additional diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is only one fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is already visible at the I@@ AA .
and what is next to the Astra at the I@@ AA even on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an ac@@ cent@@ u@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a station wagon .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan tra@@ ilers will be able to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the base model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s declar@@ ations at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact model DS 4 , which is visible at the I@@ AA .
outside , the designer of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers presented above all hands on the front part : here the radi@@ ator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a tou@@ ch@@ screen and integrated Apple Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the I@@ AA in the compact class , a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metre cell are human @-@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a ex @-@ prisoner of the judicial authority of the Te@@ gel , which was lod@@ ged for months in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the persons affected can even hope for money if they were imprison@@ ed only a few days in confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man , who is now on a free foot , has been rel@@ oc@@ ated to a larger cell .
his term of office because of the un@@ worthy prison conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Jud@@ ge took up the verdi@@ ct of the Berlin Chamber Court and transferred the case back to the renewed test .
you see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although for legal reasons only a few days of the port for compensation were decisive for compensation , a compensation claim was given . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear the protection of the personality of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of Commerce must now clarify the amount of money compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of pen@@ al prisoners in the past .
so they spoke only in April a prisoner of compensation because he was imprison@@ ed naked in a cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human @-@ un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 as well as the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 for decent housing .
the first complaint was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ lines due to lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours of aggression , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to h@@ unter @-@ h@@ unters should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial authorities , 21 points are not occupied in Te@@ gel because of the lack of evidence , 19 to fall 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Affairs this year , according to vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( C@@ DU ) demonstrated decisi@@ vely in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can create that and we create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany is the following overview .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dramatic is the lack of living space but above all with affordable rental objects : every year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments come out of the lease agreement , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments every year would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
in agreement , scientists and federal government ministers agreed that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simul@@ ated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
however , the refugees in Germany would not systematically ask for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial that they will find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mig@@ rations@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , it has given a political change : from work prohibition for refugees to recognition of labour .
while there was a work ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence of residence , which is limited to asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - also because of the short@@ age of skilled workers - the point of view is consistently en@@ forced that refugees should be able to get access to the labour market faster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German knowledge .
so far there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that work@@ places are most often convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore , according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt der Königs@@ weg zur Arbeits@@ integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few parents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parents give their children into the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , Spe@@ aker for Youth and Family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration is distributed in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators increased strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German language skills are prepared for classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no short@@ age of them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Beate St@@ acker from the Berlin School of Education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , no federal land asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( C@@ DU ) but has given up his position now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; study willing refugees could facilitate access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce do not receive services according to the asylum seek@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; law more if they begin a study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will generally not get a b@@ af@@ l because they don &apos;t fall under the circle of the victims entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persons &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be entitled to be entitled B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ um@@ b to Islam succ@@ essi@@ vely the same rights as they have the churches , and to develop the existing state churches right to a new state religion relationship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the establishment of an Islamic welfare association is important to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rights are also duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and are willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to clean up certain control possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the central council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to tigh@@ ten such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also need to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is pressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for a scar@@ ce decade an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what Mig@@ rant organisations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white German have long been calling for and why international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention in Germany must become reality in the next few years , if the country is peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what MAN@@ - Power and capacities are concerned , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls for all arri@@ vals equal to the registration of health cards .
achievements could be expected later with the federal states .
and in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to send so many people with the limited performance catalog , which fores@@ ees the asylum application law .
otherwise , the doctors make the language barriers .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been proven to get rid of migrants worse over their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs must be taken over , it demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many refugees have also been helped with more general medical appointments in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the refugees there is much more untreated disability , and with the young people it is about HIV education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with some other disease pictures German doctors would come from their training but clear , Mont@@ gom@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ites or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the medical age , the refugees may even be alle@@ vi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly re@@ prove their qualifications .
at least half of the refugees in Germany are psych@@ ically ill according to estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ sy@@ cho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study of TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
whoever is suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder is suffering from the so @-@ called fl@@ ash@@ backs with breathing difficulties , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration disturb@@ ances , strong sc@@ ary and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms of chronic , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ic sick refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill seek@@ ers in the social offices can provide an application for psycho@@ therapy , but it usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , experts or doctors who are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ estim@@ ation , says Mun@@ z .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift to the meeting is the family therefore in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to take away people from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stres@@ ses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Jun@@ ior@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of Cir@@ cus convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn Family draws the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the St@@ um@@ m@@ movies , the Cub@@ an duo wants to absorb the Cub@@ an duo .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast should conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ v@@ ae , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger@@ tips and artic@@ ulation .

ab@@ norm@@ alities in the post@@ ure of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes part in this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go well to our animals , it doesn &apos;t work well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , will be read by the eyes of every desire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
so the top priority is : good for the animals .
especially on its zeb@@ ro@@ id jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals have lived eight years in one enclosure and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is safe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the asser@@ tions of members of the opposition that they had received anonymous deaths and warned them to accompany the speech of Mr Mu@@ gabe with boys . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech to the position of the nation in parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions politicians have received SMS messages on their phones they warned about disturb@@ ing Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gab@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it war@@ ns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in parliament ends and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ person said by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,@@ 000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job breakdown leads to a load of over 2.@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who should guide the unity after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops supporting companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it is issued a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electro @-@ installations and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone massive restructuring to handle the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed towards Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his ank@@ le or with the injuries he had previously had .
this may be true from purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops a unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five seasons .
the wider picture of Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight game times since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a pr@@ one period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career out of the way he deserves .
ar@@ sen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger will be a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled not to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to treat a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are going to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,@@ 2 was measured .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the far hope to lead the club to its first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it never worked out at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in the store to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open , now more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a current study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication guided by social media , with its focus on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even though in reality domin@@ ates isolation .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the cost of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner long@@ ing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character was not defined by his work but by his personality , which sh@@ ines through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the long@@ ing from Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can relate to any case even if they often with@@ hold their feelings to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff of telephone past@@ oral care said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and sel@@ f@@ end@@ angers has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you speak openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to offer long @-@ term control mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone can help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed backdrop , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and tell him Hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning - the entire 236 episo@@ des - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PSG , Malm@@ ö to cr@@ ush
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets in the Champions League at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to pass at Malm@@ ö .
here are the play report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PSG player who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards she missed a number of occasions before she finally raised her lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball@@ tor in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ets@@ k , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish masters as they do not only strive for the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points there was no class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later changed in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ wards in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ume in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet reached one or two other gates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on their own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was eliminated in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing@@ ed storm was called the man to take the PSG to the next stage in Europe , and he pointed out why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before joining Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic played in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , came to the field with nine national players on the field and was stir@@ red up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PSG itself sometimes got up , with some fl@@ aws and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was not less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned Di Maria into a shot , which was directed by Wil@@ and at the end of the 5th minute ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er thus achieved his sixth Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had spot@@ ted a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back into the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from no short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could be low before substitute Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , was later that PSG played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish le@@ ague , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winner , four times champion Champions League winner , two times champion champion , one time champion champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer , the meanwhile 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi reveals that he was already standing out of Barcelona before the EM 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we do nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered member of the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in summer 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the breaking man for this is now working for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola and I played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns Spiel@@ zeit 2008 / 2009 would be run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , split the Red ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the royal class triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she will not need behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night from H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ went the need for alternative perspectives and in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with un@@ ei@@ ving un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian strengthened themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and it is a n@@ ut@@ te , beaten by their white hal@@ ves .
the producer of dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on re@@ fut@@ ed that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something what we do not want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval of women &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO KNOW that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Movement Black Li@@ ves reached nation@@ wide effect and urged law@@ makers and authorities to command discri@@ min@@ atory practices against colour content .
in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
as books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter released an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of entert@@ ainers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope , is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; cro@@ wned first champion
Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
the competition show , which had just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Kamer@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off Br@@ itten , to the final .
the climb on a 75 feet long climbing rope was included in 30 seconds .
Br@@ itten ended the task within the time , which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended up this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock about winning the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why Br@@ itten , although he first at all ended the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he gets the great gra@@ ti@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt as if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended for an eighth season , the fil@@ ming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sli@@ ps on Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OLI@@ S@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past , they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eb@@ all , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in target field .
the Twin@@ s w@@ asted a chance to climb inside a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word , which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all vict@@ ories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad R@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit scores three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in 1 / 3 inside and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ ley every game , and therefore I want to concentrate entirely in the game .
the designed tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two laps , his first round since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was well sh@@ attered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , saw clearly better out of the bul@@ l@@ ley , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear @-@ meeting at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to come back into the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double at the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a b@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man faced with whom he was confronted , in front of the designed R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run in the second Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was that in the Major League leading 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a Double Play
after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth place , the wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , st@@ ach S@@ ano at three pitch for his fifth save .
Detroit benefited from the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game from an even non @-@ mo@@ vable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three laps in the first two in@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been kn@@ itted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after having been missing more than one month due to a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started releasing and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch as in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed a further Run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he was not very well beaten , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever left @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez retired due to a violation of the throwing school .
he was examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder distor@@ tion , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is painted by the vulner@@ ability to start against the Twin@@ s .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30 .
he has been missing since August 20 because of gu@@ err@@ ing in the right hip .
the Tig@@ ers and the Twin@@ s will finish their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4.@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees should be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most anger@@ ed people should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 coming refugees .
several sports halls of the h@@ ess@@ ische state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily accommod@@ ated there .
they should then be distributed to other local communities .
in the past ten days , according to details of the Government Pres@@ idency of G@@ ießen , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived .
due to the large number of refugees emergency accommodation in sports halls , Frankfurt and Han@@ au are also furnished in sports halls .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he introduced the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective roads &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , it was glad that the Kel@@ ch passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on site for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria has again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary nobody will be sent back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has not sent refugees to Austria too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement , after Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said , I have already given talks between the general manager for public safety and representatives of Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concrete figures did not call them and rejected talks on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria over the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
their aim is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( C@@ DU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann joined together with several other EU heads of state and government for next week .
Germany had started on Sunday with passing border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the mandatory distribution of more 120 000 refugees on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first @-@ up and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced at the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor of the Chancellor in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined those people who want to protect the protection , also convert them too .
but whoever does not have a lead @-@ eye view could not remain in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this conception was unanim@@ ously shared in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge force of strength &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border to Serbia in the night on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest , including the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent Schle@@ pper ev@@ asion over Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , they reported thousands of migrants to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; these include researchers from observations of the room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the moon de@@ af easily on his way around the Ring Plan@@ ets .
this exchange movement is only small , but nevertheless too large for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is in a communication of the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was already known that under the ice blank@@ et of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us liquid water must give .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the southern pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon , the water vap@@ or and iron particles , and thus feed the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Ring of Saturn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least on the south pole there must be a sub@@ terran@@ ean sea , the astronom@@ ers included back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama l@@ acks in 1860 Munich several weeks

an investigation has shown an ad@@ du@@ ctor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared with .
R@@ ama had already compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich lions the diagnosis is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected four weeks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible commitment of a united pro@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ go contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line will often fall short of them .
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they include B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , Mang@@ os contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
whoever e@@ ats the fruits thus supports tend@@ on , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when buying , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or too tight and pleas@@ antly smell .
the shell color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ go can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
it sm@@ ells the slightly bitter flavor of some leaf al@@ ates like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a Mang@@ och@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , p@@ oultry , lamb and wild .

first F@@ öhn@@ sturm , then striking cold front
in the coming night falls in the valleys of the mountain@@ side of the F@@ öh@@ n , as Mete@@ o@@ Switzerland hur@@ ried on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night on Thursday , the F@@ öh@@ n partly blo@@ ws with storm strength by the foot valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings powerful ra@@ inf@@ alls , wind arches and a temperature decline .
as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently lying on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a strong south@@ western stream .
on the side of the mountain@@ side , on the night the cave breaks through the valleys .
in the after@@ math of the F@@ öh@@ n until Thursday morning in the cili@@ atory valleys with Bö@@ en from 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly with more than 100 km / h .
the cave is able to penet@@ rate into the adjacent middle area , and on the mountains even or@@ kan@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures ranging from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow on the mountain@@ side .
here is a rain that stops until Thursday evening .
in sum , south of the Alps will have to be expected in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , which after the last few days have already fallen big amounts of rain .
on Thursday morning the air goes out , in the row a cold front rolls with strong , partly t@@ wit@@ ted rain from west to east across Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind blo@@ ws strongly up to stor@@ my , and temperatures go far back .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin @-@ Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of Stadt@@ prä@@ sident Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino on Wednesday an un@@ nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Reform@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honored as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested from the work community of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded me that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es have lived in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority , often only in the secret of their faith .
with the square , in a symbolic way , the tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held a few months in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he received the city at that time as a disgu@@ sting sin @-@ b@@ abel .
his negative impressions could be strengthened by histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then initiated the split of the late church with his theses against Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ andel .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn @-@ crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ fs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is not syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , it can be quite glo@@ omy .
approximately three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ ther@@ ly .
with this he spont@@ aneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on painting with the respective Bible passages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages from Ot@@ mar Old and thus translated into current context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible study by Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was the up@@ bringing about the pipe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up to carry me back with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to help art in a faster time again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is marked today by Rek@@ l@@ ame , and it is no@@ isy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sym@@ bo@@ lik &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is being pushed out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things .
pictures always have a bit of secret and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer enter the images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hin@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they look at themselves , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old do not pay attention to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected for him important , also mysterious themes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the images , the text explains merely &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans Mö@@ hler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for Mö@@ hler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , company mand@@ ated to model Erd@@ hü@@ gel for a circular course : one year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already finished .
fail@@ ures in politics and administration provided for dr@@ unken , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to toler@@ ate the train .
so hill top , new place was sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will take place in October , the first municipal council Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football re@@ acts to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the problems faced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle no one can say , that &apos;s nothing but I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to be interested in getting this subject into the grip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the next Wednesday in the Chancellor and meet the Minister of State Ec@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive course must put politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German football club therefore has extended its refugee policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ sbach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already at this weekend the 36 professional clubs are setting a clear sign when they are on the left Tri@@ kot@@ är@@ mel instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ chef Rud@@ i Vö@@ ller of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes everyone , nobody can &apos;t get away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football , no , we must use our radiation , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hertha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday the national team of women 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale invites the European team to play against Hungary on this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ sbach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licenses have started their own projects in their places , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we spent will live in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government will provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already launched the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ sbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; reports : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP Executive Board &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loses an eye for an accident in accident &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye through a fall at the beginning of July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the accident on the staircase in the house of his brother in the United States , he fell to a water @-@ glas after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic week &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost blood @-@ bloo@@ ded , was power@@ less and then to@@ wed to the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet in front of the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully labour @-@ capable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead to the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen to something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to stand up again if one is fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Ersatz@@ pilot Mag@@ n@@ us@@ sen beside skir@@ mish ...
Mag@@ n@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a corresponding photo and explained he suffered injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as a reserve driver for the two family mp@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ onso and Jen@@ son Button in Singapore , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : BV@@ B ohne Re@@ us gegen Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller im Tor
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us finally broke out in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ ell with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach was open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high loads of his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its trunk to the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the por@@ ch position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of stem man Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion .
if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in the future in all Europe League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el was open .
with a high probability he will also best@@ ow the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ sche statement of fellow players Re@@ us that the Fin@@ al@@ ein@@ zug für den BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marco Wei@@ gl considers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to attack the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants pione@@ ering role for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany shall be a pioneer in the change of the car &apos;s technological advance .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automated and net@@ worked drive will increase traffic safety and provide less stability , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he wants to discuss the subject also with his counter@@ part colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries that come together with representatives of the industry at the I@@ AA .
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier of the Ministry of Transport highlights the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid shift on digital radio .
for testing new technology there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to employ around internationally that the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is lifted from 10 to 130 km / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to use a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen people as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , vehicle @-@ less vehicles on public roads will be expected to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far from 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport policy S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and security of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still see scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .

anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital ban , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire trip on all roads .
at least 15 percent could be expected on the motorway , at the St@@ au 45 percent .
good everyone would leave the car to control under no circumstances .

according to the current status , the Düsseldorf Congress will only be able to hit the cover from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision is scheduled to fall on 22 September at the latest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ bauer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM @-@ Te@@ aching in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor appointment in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer so a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained single Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who performs the S@@ etz@@ liste in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was also missing , and we became the European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the world @-@ rank fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ quin that can look terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who was among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the En@@ f@@ ant , the Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was easy , meanwhile it &apos;s genuine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( Vom Bürger@@ stei@@ g auf den Lauf@@ ste@@ g ) , which is to be seen in the Kuns@@ thalle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ pfer has changed his initial post@@ ure to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was on the other hand , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition so@@ unded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously done in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having an apprentic@@ eship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed total artwork that has been operated for much effort : to refres@@ h the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated .
14 tons of material have bar@@ red the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot after Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gaul@@ tiers alter Teddy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , delicate fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cast of fashion he then taught himself later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , like Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it , but of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the models .
they got nothing but could keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener lace as fashion niche
in the past , it went to the long stit@@ ching machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in a large amount of customers , which they used for example to blank@@ ets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ ors Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener peak mode played a major role , then was pushed through the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now being re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and in regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styles , is an increasing job potential .
who does not use niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ ver@@ itze Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien together with nine other companies .
only they may bear the protected label .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; private business and wholesale markets are almost no longer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
the mass goods are manufactured much cheaper nowadays in the Asian region and distributed almost exclusively via chains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a weak@@ ening of export , current to Russia and the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points like Cord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ der@@ y in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma desig@@ ner@@ in Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger Auß@@ enst@@ elle der West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that have to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile desig@@ ner@@ in Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball tip .
the machine sti@@ cks small kitchens at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold@@ smith master@@ master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße was inspired : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was able to do nothing with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener peak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they use the snow@@ ball tip for their jewelry .
in an elaborate process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and Sur@@ ro@@ undings and would like to have a mem@@ or@@ and@@ um .
I see my jewellery as modern amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of the Pl@@ au@@ ener peak .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends should not be touched , but Disney dar@@ es to have a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a new film , but a kind of continuation , which takes 20 years after the first film with the magic children &apos;s girl .
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already firm : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world
the economy must open wider towards the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should focus on attra@@ cting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Command Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promote new spin and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , Xi said .
the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls politics , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , priv@@ ates capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the population milking system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified which will not come into question for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs to the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarant@@ e@@ eing a constitutional business environment and designed the market open , the statement said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilitate the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to ensure their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also attended Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury border value in pre@@ dat@@ ors
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and to exploit consumers a significantly higher dose of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , who is an appropriate Arbeit@@ sp@@ ap@@ ier of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharp@@ ly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects mis@@ understood industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve toxic for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as Hai@@ - or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy , &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already stressed today so strongly with mercury , that on the basis of the current limit values , about 50 percent of the threads are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be ru@@ de .
in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
Food@@ watch described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are mostly so low , that they already hold the planned maximum values today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in cl@@ einf@@ les is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dence of distra@@ ction man@@ oeu@@ v@@ res that only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic for humans , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already low quantities can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially in case of un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry says on his homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should not be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury enters the environment above all through coal inc@@ iner@@ ation .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants viol@@ ated Ann@@ al@@ ena B@@ aer@@ bock more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total volume in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , about in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and surface @-@ covered &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cited in March from paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year &apos;s war@@ nings before mercury in fish were already among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
