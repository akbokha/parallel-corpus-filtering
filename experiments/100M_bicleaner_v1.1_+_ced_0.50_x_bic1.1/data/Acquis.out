should core material that is subject to securing measures under this Agreement , in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the association with the organisation agrees to such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures may be termin@@ ated in relation to this material in relation to this material .
II ) that the material will not be used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear plants during the period of non @-@ application of the securing measures after this Convention .
B ) The organisation and the community make a provision that the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
in the scheme , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these securing measures are not applied .
in any event , the preventive measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity .
the organization is held on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of this material in the concerned state or the relevant states and on any passing on such material from this state or these states on the ongoing basis .
this explains their understanding as quickly as possible ; it extends only on matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a secret knowledge of military activity , and does not refer to the successful use of the core material .
the organization , the community and the states bear the costs of each of them in carrying out their respective obligations under this agreement .
if the community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereignty , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se these costs as long as it has been agreed beforehand in advance .
in any case , the organisation carries the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and the States ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other regulations , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same way as to the citizens of the States .
any claim that the Community or State applies to the Organization or the Organization to the Community or the State for Dam@@ ages , except for damages resulting from a nuclear incident , which have ar@@ isen from the implementation of the security measures pursuant to this Convention , is governed in accordance with international law .
after examining the relevant information submitted by the Director General , the Council is not able to verify that no core material , which has to be subject to securing measures under this Convention , can be reimbur@@ sed for nuclear weapons or other nuclear missi@@ les , and if necessary , it may take the other measures envis@@ aged there .
in such steps , the Council takes into account what mass has been acquired by the applied safety measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned - any reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security .
upon request of the Organization , the Community or the State , consultations on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention are held .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention will be reviewed by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the concerned state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes , to as@@ certain the Council after Article 19 or a measure adopted by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be settled on the request of a party to an arbit@@ ral tribunal , consisting of five arbit@@ rators .
the community and the states are nam@@ ing two arbit@@ rators ; the organisation also ap@@ points two arbit@@ rators , and the four arbitr@@ ator appointed , choose a fifth that leads the presi@@ dency .
if the community and the States or the organization have not named two arbit@@ rators within thirty days of the request for an arbit@@ ration request , the community or the organization may elect the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbit@@ rators .
the same procedure must be applied if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the Organization , the Community and the States concerned .
a ) This Convention applies to non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contracting party of the contract and members of the Community ( in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization notes that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this agreement and
II ) if the organization of the organization notes that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The Organization , the Community and the States consult each other on request of one of the Parties to a change of this Convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The Director General immediately instruc@@ ts all Member States of the Organization from any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
a ) This Convention enters into force on the day when the organization of the Community and the States receives written notification that its procedures are concluded for entry into force .
B ) This Agreement will remain in force for so long as the states are contracting party of the Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conventions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedure as required in the implementation of the provisions of part I on preventive measures .
the aim of the preventive measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of the bran@@ ching of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear plants for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rence of such dis@@ agreement by the risk of premature discovery .
to enrich the target set in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , composite with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the verification by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material not shown for any material balance zone is specified under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified amounts specified for a particular period of time .
in carrying out their investigations , the Organization makes full use of the Community &apos;s security system after Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the core material community based on this agreement rests on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their security measures , the Community of de processes and measures will make use of the following methods and , as far as it is necessary , fores@@ ee how they are defined in the supplementary agreements and are practical :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of obtained , produced , lost , lost , or otherwise removed nuclear material and stock quantities ;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and receiver ;
( e ) procedures for the evaluation of accum@@ ulations of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and reporting system which indicates the core material inventory and changes in the material balance zone for each sheet of material and the changes of this stock , including the input and output of the material balance zone ;
g ) provisions that ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Method to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization according to articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures under this Agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material that has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in letter c ) is introduced into the states , so the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) relies on core material , which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the association is temporarily not possible or desirable to recover from resi@@ dues , the organization and the community shall consult each other on the application of appropriate safety measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention will be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
on request of the Community , the Organization exemp@@ ts the following core material from the security measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material , if it is used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 which is over 80 % .
upon request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures pursuant to this Convention , of these safegu@@ ards unless the entire material quantity delivered by this Article in states is at no longer at any point
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram special material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium is calculated by the multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium enrich@@ ment with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
should the core material be delivered together with core material that is subject to the securing measures under this agreement , be processed or stored , precau@@ tions are made for the re @-@ use of the securing measures on that material .
the Community is meeting with the Organization of Supp@@ le@@ mentary Ab@@ mach@@ inations , which is necessary for the successful and effective gro@@ oming of the duties of the organization according to the Convention , in detail how to apply the procedures set out in the Convention .
the supple@@ mental agreements may be extended or altered without amend@@ ment of this Convention in agreement between the organization and the Community .
the supple@@ mental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention into force . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to make these agreements come into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
based on the initial report outlined in Article 62 , the organization presents a summari@@ zed inventory of the total core material underlying the securing measures of this Convention , regardless of its origins , and continues to carry out this inventory because of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
in weighing up GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource transfer problems .
C ) The aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States is that all the contributions paid by the Member States are bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
( D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the links to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table from which it is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this Agreement -
the organization al@@ ig@@ ns a special account under the name &quot; Special Trade Account , &quot; which the Member States contributed in accordance with this agreement to the special transaction account ; this account is managed and used by the organisation as administrator , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or in@@ trin@@ sic notes of the member state , which , upon request , to pay in the currency of the relevant state to the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited with the organization &apos;s deposit in that country concerned .
B ) Payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to January 1 , 1979 , or at a different time agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget@@ ary plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may make payments to the above @-@ mentioned dates on request .
the administrator takes approximately proportional draw on the cash or school notes according to the usual procedures of the organization in order to cover the expenses for the special loan and to balance the transaction account appropriately .
in the granting of these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its other lending capacity to loan terms without discount ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ ectable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) which is considered , approved , and administr@@ ated by the organisation funded by the organisation , regardless of whether it is the institution funded by the organisation , which is to be considered in the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the non @-@ cash account may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or of the Organization , which has been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organisation within the framework of a loan or loan for a program or project .
apart from section 4 , special loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally valid for the institution loans granted by the organization ; thus , in the case of ten years of free time , they are re@@ payable in 50 years .
special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this watch must be paid directly to the organization that maintains it .
each loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular .
recei@@ pts from each transaction loan can be used for issues in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or provided in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a transaction loan , in accordance with what the administrator has set at the time of loan guarantee .
the capital re@@ payments of special loans are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in this manner in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the administrator shall instruc@@ t the E@@ EC to complete all the special loans provided by the directors in preparation and through the projects and programmes approved by the directors .
during the period of payment of the special loans , the administrator teaches the E@@ EC four times a year on the development of the special loans and the expenses incurred for this purpose .
the car@@ et@@ aker tran@@ sm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the financial account with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organization at this account .
upon full payment of the special loans , the car@@ et@@ aker of the E@@ EC tran@@ sm@@ its a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and performs suitable records and accounts from which the contributions to the cash account , the amounts paid to the account , the amounts paid to the account and the deposits paid to the Member States are evident .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker make an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account from time to time , the progress of programs or projects financed by special transactions and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the Organisation may , if necessary , have not entered into force , the agreement and all resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due .
if the total amount of capital of all the special loans taken by the recipients is ref@@ unded in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and transferred to Member States , this agreement and all obligations arising there@@ from are termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States are not@@ ing the conclusion of the proceedings to the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat will forward these noti@@ fications together with a notification of the proper approval of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two manus@@ cripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch ; each wor@@ ding is equally authentic .
considering that the agreement in the form of a correspondence to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is en@@ acted :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Nu@@ clear Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation will be transferred to a joint venture following chapter V of the Eur@@ atom treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Common company J@@ ET . &quot;
Switzerland has been dealing with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area in question .
since extensive work has been carried out until the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interests of the contracting parties of the present agreement to sum@@ mar@@ ise their respective efforts in order to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research work which has achieved a higher priority level because of the energy crisis .
this agreement will enable any contracting party to benefit from the consolidation of its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the resources provided for both un@@ il@@ ateral research and therefore the common objective of this research , i.e. the cost @-@ competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction , to achieve faster .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the Parties will associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot;
in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term objectives and forms of cooperation with the Eur@@ atom programme ; it is extended or modified following inspection by the organs referred to in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme .
each time the contracting parties accept a new programme , this will be replaced by the programs listed in Anne@@ x I and II to the present agreement .
the association is realised in paragraph 1 by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
- the exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories working on Eur@@ atom &apos;s programme ;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .

in view of the implementation of the association agreement envis@@ aged in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this agreement , the Parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those who are called &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s &quot; in view of the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme .
with the same objective Eur@@ atom is responsible for ensuring that Switzerland is involved with the timing of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Sharing . &quot;
in view of the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of J@@ ET , the joint undertaking of the present agreement , which it accepts .
moreover , Eur@@ atom has to ensure that Switzerland can become the contractual partner of any contract whose goal falls within the framework of the present agreement , except for association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with carrying out the association provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement are described in articles 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
the association agreement , in particular , includes the suspension of a steering committee comprised of representatives of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the development of research work and to direct the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group established within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme - in the following &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , who has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the Eur@@ atom programme , is undertaking this task in regard to all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and addresses their T * value in the interests of both parties to the common objective set out in Eur@@ atom and in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world should be considered du@@ ly .
according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG will ap@@ point one or more Swiss representatives in the consultation groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme , whenever the competent Swiss authorities request it .
the consultation groups , which provide the VG research proposals with a view to providing the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme , perceive this task in regard to all research and development work that is refer@@ enced in this agreement .
as part of the Eur@@ atom Programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the involved laboratories .
the Committee of Directors , who has supervised the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and is responsible for the optimal use of the capacities of the laboratories which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the programme , leads to this task with regard to all research and development work that falls under the present agreement .
it provides for the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss programme .

&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the preceding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobili@@ zation of Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial support
the BI@@ S could close a stand@@ by credit agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application .
the agreements could be closed down to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ icing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some conditions are already mentioned , for which the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each stand@@ by credit the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of el@@ ong@@ ation , but without a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as for the extension of the loan , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening fee .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws will not be made before a month after conclusion of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draws would take place in the currencies available at the BC@@ Cs at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods taking account of the Bank &apos;s resources , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those made by the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to proc@@ ure the required funds themselves on the market , the interest rate , which is to be applied to the application , could reach a maximum equivalent to the Libor rate .
I would be grateful if you would like to give me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I encourage you to express the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this writing .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Eastern Europe on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb .
I call on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are covered as follows :
- fresh or ch@@ illed amm@@ el , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( tari@@ ff point 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the common customs tari@@ ff ) ;
- frozen mam@@ mo@@ ths , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( tari@@ ff area 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the import options for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following annual amount :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is committed to ensuring that the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to conventional proposal forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the offer form is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement will consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee listed under the number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community claims the protection clause , it obli@@ ges itself to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the community market in this agreement will not be affected by this Agreement .
in the event that imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year concerned .
the Association comm@@ its itself to limit exhaus@@ tion to the imports of products collected by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st set of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new member states , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the amount specified under number 2 according to the extent of Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account under the number 5 above @-@ mentioned ho@@ ech@@ ism of the de@@ ple@@ tion .
the total amount stated under number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community to 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could adver@@ sely affect the commerci@@ alization of Urugu@@ ay@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community shall take precau@@ tions to prevent the sale of frozen meat on frozen meat , due to the implementation of the regulation , to under@@ mine the sales of Urugu@@ ay@@ an Schaff@@ lei@@ sch .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as the slaugh@@ tering of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only take place at prices and conditions that comply with existing international commitments and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products .
these terms can be interpreted in a manner consistent with article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General customs and trade agreement .
Uruguay ass@@ ures compliance with this Agreement , in particular by granting export lic@@ ences specified in this Agreement for the products listed under number 1 .
the community , in turn , comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Uruguay is made dependent on the submission of an export license , which is granted by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in implementing provisions , it is also stipul@@ ated that the responsible Urugu@@ ay@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals tells the amounts that export lic@@ ences have been granted ; these details may , if necessary , be en@@ coded in accordance with the country of destination .
this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Eastern Europe on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before the 1 . April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government with this letter .

a re@@ agent for the determination of blood groups must react with all tested blood samples which contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or another on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is comp@@ uted only of the volume of the blood cell in@@ und@@ ation in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , activity is expressed through the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set up international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time norms .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents to determine the blood group definition of most speci@@ f@@ ties is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ filtration .
the ti@@ ter gives di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mix within a series , where a microsc@@ opic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International Standard Prepar@@ ations ( currently anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the title ration of the unknown agent in comparison with the International Standard Prepar@@ ation or a State Nor@@ ma Prepar@@ ation in International Units ( See Bulletin who O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall be retained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the date of exp@@ iry of dry re@@ agents on the label is determined by the results of the tests on the shelf ; it must be approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and that is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent authorities can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to provide the conditions for specific@@ ity and efficacy .
sera human origin for the determination of blood groups must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of liquid or re @-@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , whether in liquid form or after replacement , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents intended for international exchange for blood group determination should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least as long as an International Convention on a consistent system has come about .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent contained in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records on all stages of production and inspections of the re@@ agents for the determination of blood groups .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents are to be kept from the laboratory for a long time until it is possible to assume that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used to determine blood groups may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part ; others are the necessary tools to ampli@@ fy the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective portion .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents may contain no substances of human origin .
on each individual container a black on white printed label can be attached in English and French , which contains the following details : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for recovery ,
in addition , the label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers , contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
